... disappearance what\nWe know and don't know that link is that on point radio David welcome to on point structure\nSo first of all tell us what do we know about what the latest is in terms of what's happening in Istanbul at uh the Saudi consulate there we're seeing that a Turkish officials have been allowed inside the consulate what is what's happened since then\nThere is a report from the Associated Press but I haven't been able to confirm it apparently the prosecutors are saying they found some evidence that ... was killed inside the conflict but a murder took place there are that's becoming less and less\nIt took place there are that's becoming less and less controversial as the Saudi Arabian authorities have shifted their story I see\nOh they are no they no longer appear to be denying that anything happened to your mouth because she'll be while he was in the conflict\nNow they're shifting to he was killed there but it was a a a kind of rendition gone wrong interrogation or rendition went horribly awry Mm um and so that's that seems to be the state of play\nOkay so I'm seeing here the Associated Press reports that you're referring to again this is from the a P uh that

disappearance and reported\nKilling of journalists and dissident Jamal ... showed gee\nI'm joined today by Steven Cook he's a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations\nAnd also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University a and a professor heckle even before the break you said ... it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed ah been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are [noise]\nWell you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yes where he was fed it in and received you know as a great kind of international statesman and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with um the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of topics one was uh the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign at the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lastly was of the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were um instill our reforming diversifying their economy they wanted to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is is is a very personal and tight one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the uh attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nUm the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook though the ... the president has said that he he would vow quote severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi or influence or out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ...\nUh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a that punishment to affect arms sales for example I'm a bit at least ... billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president in\n... president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave ah been an effort to provide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and who's inclination is\nActually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted\nI think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas uh something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of\nPressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of democracy joke tea\nUm but uh overall uh this is a president who has not made human rights or a priority and ... has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration but was actually agree to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but it's not point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nAh that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\nWell that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nA given the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of the uh Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon\nA oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global a capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians are are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a a compelling interest\nOr in the radius civility in supporting Saudi Arabia security\nWell I think so I just want to get it's okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel you in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship of the structural relationship not a transactional want even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately they are fundamentally imports\nIn terms of price immediately\nThey are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American\nOr an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against ah the the radical Islamist the Saudis are instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAnd a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it a policy of the kingdom to turn away from a Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if you if you succeed in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or India\nI Want to play a clip here uh on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage hedge point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states stands to lose perhaps morally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners on line who's who's talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again that Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nOr ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there I mean it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but the so called including type relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want a to secure American security interests around the region\nOr who want to fight the Islamic state and wants to counter Iranian influence\nUm it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American ... American policymakers overlooking or with their blessing ah this is\n... we'll visit puppy clubs at USF Tampa saint Petersburg and the next university Wednesday of seven forty five AM and again at five forty four pm\nSupport for on point comes from Charles River of heroin making the new Englander rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever the day has in store for the new phone collection is on view at the Charles river apparel dot com\nAnd sing gauge working to make higher education more affordable with us engage unlimited subscription\nStudents can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework accents code and study God send gauge unlimited C.

I mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show on that interview on the White House lawn yes say was you know another act it's another why I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress and I'll get something they catch total forty ... hair and can can do something yeah I'm an art show there's global daycares that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump\nBut that the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against\nThe human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDelivers thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all ... to ... assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] yeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing of ... I'm In I think that it's certainly\nIt's unfortunate that the president refers to press as the enemy of the people ah it certainly underscores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\n'em and people like vitamin uproot and Turkish president reject type ... won a others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh it's this decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians are killing people and small British pounds a in Dupont Circle Washington D. C. Dupont Circle who tells the Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world\nNone of those countries have paid a price for that and that ah the Saudis must to believe that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is in the international environment that transcends a that trend since President Trump\nOkay so I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... himself had has set about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that should have dug deeper in into and that is\nUm how much does the president's personal business interest in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think that is influencing\nOr his approach to this current diplomatic crisis\n[noise] well there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president in his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh\nUm but ah there are an extensive links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his family is a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different ah business interests and it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically about how the president is making a decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position\nWith allegations coming from a a a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had ...\nNATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly in in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that ... anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the ...\nVersus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia well\nAnd look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington Jeff last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic records uh well let's take another call here say eat is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\nThough I Am calling to rank an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the hospital she situation\nI'm In terms of bending to the political domestic political forces that international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us of a similar situation we were in in Nineteen Seventy six or\nThe emergence of new American president Jimmy Carter make human rights they central piece of his foreign policy\nPricing pressure on the bench already on a on human rights record\nResulting displacement and the conversion of the coast American ally of Iran wants them to the greatest American Fall\nAnd a significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran result taking over a million Iranians get seven million an exile and Seventy million living under tyranny is what happens when when one American foreign policy\nUm treats human rights as if they saw and point I'm does not understand the strategic dimensions that uh are involved in that in in our relationship\nSaid thank you for your call a Bernard Haykel what did how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a it's it's certainly true um\nI I think that ah you know the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that you know there is a very important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah\nSome of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis are rivals um the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis so one has to be really careful\nOr in the coming to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic a episode I think that the most important thing is to focus on is a crime was committed to get people punished for the crime\nBut not to jeopardize the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing a the weakening of the regime there could\nBe a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging and it's similar one uh you know God Forbid in Saudi Arabia would lead us to a military intervention possibly in in this region and that's not something we want to get involved with\nMean you can have to take away coming up at three o'clock this afternoon you're listening to W.

talking this hour with Dale Earnhardt junior he is a retired NASCAR driver or one of the most popular drivers in NASCAR history to time winner of the Daytona five hundred he retired with twenty six wins in the NASCAR cup series\nAnd he's the author of a new book it's titled racing to the finish my story and it's the story of all the concussions he suffered as a NASCAR driver what effect they had on his life and what he did to heal himself\nAnd why he's speaking out about concussions and NASCAR as well we've got an excerpt of it at one point radio dot org a ... before the break we were talking about that really hard hit that you took on the tire test into in twenty twelve or in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of releasing this very significant race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book into the the big hits that you took\nThat scared straight as you were saying uh a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway in Alabama\nI'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened [noise]\nIn that last lap the cars are basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it or you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch and here's Dale Earnhardt junior is over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash\nEverybody [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell ... tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help yeah so uh this was four weeks\nThe Kansas crash that hit it or been some sort of terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with those symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was big big dense relief for me but there was also\nA sense of fear because the Talladega they have these big PACs our cars and when there are those type of crashes is they're they're impossible to skate so I knew the chances of me being involved in another accident were very high for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that all I wanted was to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I felt like I'd be own freeing\nAnd um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during a crash cart tee ball on the side of the car and on the car around and I immediately went all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before and maybe even worse and so\nBut this was a different kind of injury the right because we were like whipped around yeah so the ... this was instead of a an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in radio communication and uh that's\nIn a radio communication and uh that's something not typically probably wouldn't be having that I wouldn't be really having that personal of a conversation over that radio because it's something that the entire team in ... all the fans can here and have access to\n'em but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control your emotions in your ... and all those things and so\nUm [noise] I ... I knew that through my through reading\nAbout concussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you uh retire players are just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about Larry layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and right\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something um changed about Jews and something couldn't correct\nWell you can it's not been here for a second because he knew really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit at Talladega as you were saying like you were\n... more emotional less less restrained NASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track at two hundred miles an hour\nBut uh you seen the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me big pack of reporters wanting to ask you about the crash\nHe started talking in your eyes get why any volume picks up in your face starts turning\nRed and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody you know\n... nobody simple enough to\nRealize just how ridiculous that was a man was hey is ridiculous evidence was what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it to like that [noise] that's how he writes every week I'd find a job at bloodthirsty if that's the way people act was alone Lance ridiculously [noise] I don't even want to go day tell her doubting next year\nBut I got much choice it's really not rice and I don't know it's just as a result it's pointing out at all when as soon as I was like [noise] helps a lot of money rather just a lot of wasted I mean if this\nRace and that's how we're going to continue to write and nothing's going to change I think that our building cars so there's a lot of money\nEarnhardt junior how out of character was that for you [noise] I think it's pretty asked out of character you be that\nUm to be that aggressive I think was out of character for me\nAnd I could feel my motions I'm In that moment you know sort of not knocking feel myself not being able to shut up you know not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those opinions to myself because they were gonna do mean no good bye\nI'm sharing them and that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and [noise]\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR will enough and and my intentions as in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport and then that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control it [noise] that was the worst part about it and and\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information at ... dot com and\nThen gauge working to make higher education more affordable with his engage on limited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and study guides gauge unlimited C. E. N. G. A. G. E. dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour with Dale Earnhardt junior his new book is racing to the finish my story and it's about all the concussions he suffered as a top tier NASCAR driver a he's a two time winner the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR most popular\nDriver award and a earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand twelve but those were not his first I mean in the book Dale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race\nAnd his head hit the roll cages so hard that his helmet had put put a big dent into the bar that was in Nineteen Ninety eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the Napa auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant ten of California\nWomen were taunting the rescue personnel [noise] not to bring them in my brain job would be inside of these bars and the administration and everything else [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we've got ... got in there for the call it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hope that all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a man than in the car was the only thing that really could help me decide ah [noise] you know exactly how bad the situation was and how long I needed to get better so I Know better next time I shouldn't give it a secret as much as I did but um [noise] you know I didn't want to cause through much alarm because it really wasn't as\nSerious I guess everybody has made it out there be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey call and he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program\nAnd he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to appoint\nAn actor or it's really great to have you because obviously as as Diehl writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office\nI mean you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes I mean what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\nWhat did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him I saw Dale twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale ...\nWe actually got Dale better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale\nHe was very sick uh with these issues that we commonly see with concussion and quite honestly I I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I Want to Dale to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd then just jump in here though 'cause I mean the the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems are on the oldest sings hand eye coordination all\nThe things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life um\nYou know so racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar or initially saw Dale and\nAnd you know we've really identified ... learned a lot about concussion and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the average signals coming from and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with Dale and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got him better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh that Nikki Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what they wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nTimes is very very specific specific regimen of exercise in and out of the protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nUh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when a brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there's some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated but in ... profile of difficulties\nWith the way you treat the problems uh Dale had is actually through ... training\nAnd so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach a whether the rate regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again whereas the ... and single coming from and then and then matched the right treatment to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah we'll Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\nYeah actually that was so ah interesting I guess I'm you know a\nHearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had a just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and looking and just really just be able to contact Mickey had to get a ... where he was in and see him\nUm that was\nThink the beginning of the reason for writing this book in\nOf the reason for writing this book and make you told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here\nAnd he'll tell you that you as people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that\nI I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and then I made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt you there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins they said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nAre you are so concerned freaked out really about uh how much you were struggling after your\nYour dual concussions in in twenty twelve but that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did that was so profound for you\nThat ... you know he did that on a couple occasions\nI had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were\nNot working I'm not focusing not I couldn't they weren't stable if I walked across the room they ever you know the ... the environment and shook and I my eyes just wouldn't uh wouldn't\nSettle and it was so so frustrating 'cause it it was there every minute of every day and it affected anything and everything you did\nAnd it was there for months to a wooden getting better I was working and rehabbing and doing those doing exercises in the homework that Mickey had given me and it wasn't\nChanging and uh I was getting more and more worried and so I called Mickey invested Mickey I really just got to ask you something real quick and I said to have you seen this I problem and\nA cause a a patient's ... patients idea is that the doctor has to stay positive he's not gonna be a negative person and tell you this isn't going to work and this is what you got a new you know

be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with this poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy solutions to the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus\nWith a policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to peak global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I

do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and\nYou know this is this is the pizza around recognizing how difficult this information and like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me like six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it\nPeople can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo that the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the price as you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger and\nAnxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotion and often when we feel the emotion ... into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world and then we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being on it that yeah that is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the way to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change by which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around and collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy\nFeels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWhen I when I thought yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit with the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that\nWe're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U. S. Native American and indigenous Native American people who have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line\nAnd ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive\nThrough massive massive chef we know these stories and we can inform our strengths and resilience our courage by looking at the story of for example water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up

heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard it's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nYou know if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a\nOr you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop\nWill share some of your stories tomorrow on one day back now to our conversation with Sarah my ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety\nBefore we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change the do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that\nIt will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we\nHave the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida\nUm but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is here at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to\nThat well I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they had to have it in that um that the the projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration thing we are able to do a very good job at projecting\nA the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nThank I guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYeah and there's cut and so there its complexity and how the regional climate and the the the novelty of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and ... and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been ... oscillation between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming to enter glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial date so that ...\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial date so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paved by changing geometric relationship between the earth and the\nKinds of Sarah back up along the changing geometric relationship between glacial and enter glacial stay last me it's so cool it's amazing when it's confusing like like bring it on earth from me\nOkay so in the ... million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial state where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent the level at lower\nOn it's a colder climate and and then in ... states so we are an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThat on the ... the thing that I'm ... ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat with paid by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth killed as it moves around\nOn so I Want to make sure following you this heartbeat this hurts heartbeat between hold too warm\nCold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that they that they are at like ... okay that makes for a\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last ... million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying earlier on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control\nThat's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed up a degree and a half Fahrenheit we're on our way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit\nAnd it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house press office or your

is that a reasonable feeling\n[noise] you know you hope that people don't feel\nFoolish but it is true and and one of your ah your earlier guest commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know like my ah girls in school now\nAnd they don't have the standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now or it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is\nEducating people both at the consumer level in one of the things I talk about it in the books even at our most sophisticated institution so let's say MIT\nLearning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for a change in that it doesn't depend on just your behavior ... or ... which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone than it was your fault if you got that there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like what they make eye contact what do you expect to get out of that that's kinda today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nAlpha new Merrick ah thirty character password every thirty days for twenty five different accounts you have that as your father's a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset well we need to do is focus ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that meeting the tiny west had with President Trump in the oval office there was a shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and it's a really bad passwords\nZero zero which for those replaying the home game is a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the Cold War in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but the setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live and and then you need to\nExecute Honda's values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh now where not pat ya that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx\nHospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world\nWorked together to collectively impose a cost on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of what I was telling their stories that\nWe didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public I think importantly so that consumers so that companies can ... a ... that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Miller said in a speech he worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller set at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same road led to Rome's downfall for they allow the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people in places but the invaders\nThose whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote is this another Roman moment we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we don't realize the moments are the moments that were and I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out and uh and in the Pennsylvania area\nIt was the first major speech on cyber as a national security threat I think about that it is now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major official to be the top threat and it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later are a number of former Justice Department person Monica vicar from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... used aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years running an ashtray division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about the still I think people haven't heard about a ... of the case that looks from the perspective of ...\nBut still I think people haven't heard about a ... of the case that looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out saying that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks [noise] he also through bitcoin you also on the back and had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named today to saying he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to him was turn it into a kill list\nThat said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's a new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend\nWith terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John as Michelle has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShow ... in fact one of the cases we talked about it an Internet a bank heist a worry hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me as from ATMs I think Michelle does have a point you know for twenty five years\nWe moved almost everything we value from analog space from books and papers to digital space\nAnd connect it using a protocol the Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed with security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nRisk without taking into account that the bad guys the terrorists that the rogue nation states the crooks are going to move into that space we're just starting to reckon with that\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from home advisor matching homeowners with home

about the threat from cyber attacks and we know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you law bright in without having type your password every time\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or trying to catch these hackers and this you\nNow the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress but his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic an optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and it's Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful neutral for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well and developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day as the first thing we become aware as if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violate our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove of the terror propaganda that we removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flat it for us\nNow once content had been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on the content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages\nAre and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's got to be\nA hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area of the person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak a different kind of language it and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used\nSo that the big focus on our hiring once you're hired as a controversy or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm effect of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook to violate the terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it\nIs the kind of thing to say a reviewer or thought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on a site\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tool that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation\nWith spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can ... majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all\nThat content before anybody in the community send it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very can textual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or\nAt our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words that I might you to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch so it's really important for us to give tools to people\nSo that if I ... on Facebook you can report it at our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to contact patterns\nHow does that pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise buy it in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow\nThose groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site um if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represented in al ... the page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody and then at the appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that as because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are\nYou based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that's what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you were a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use your if you just hop on a
