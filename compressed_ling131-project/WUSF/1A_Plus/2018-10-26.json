Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nMy guests today are Daniel deal at the Toronto Star sung Kim of the Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack\nBeatty a son and the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah\n[noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm\nIn the president's framing of it as part of a ... as an issue of vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or their sense of this is a turning attention maternal options I think\nThat that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here\nThat this caravan while it is traveling we've kept the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away\nUm you know experts in the region and on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions in their home countries and trying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these are asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states um I Do want to point out one new development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here\nTo seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same\nNational security rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban in the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that band was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court and one option that the administration is now considering it's doing that on the southern border\nUm you know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on and addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more\nI'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that ... as well as reporting for the star from Washington or you kind of bird dog the statements from the president for major officials are pretty much in ...\nAre you kind of bird dog the statements from the president from major officials are pretty much in real time and a rather extraordinary way I'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered other presidents claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in with Central American migrants moving toward the U.S border here's what a vice president had to say\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents him terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there was not the individuals are from the middle east as a part of this growing the care\nDaniel how accurate at the president and vice presidents remarks been in terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in like a logic class um you know he he got mad as President Pence made us a statement that his arguably factual this is based on department of homeland security to sticks about people and tear walked those being prevented from entering the country\nAnd then made a completely unfounded link a leap from that to the care of and you know just because ten terrorists or suspected terrorists were legit terrorists are prevented from entering the country\nUm had to know all the is a connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in human history I shouldn't\nHave made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this ... that had no granting it ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about them at the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out he said real power is I don't want to use the word see here\nHe's playing on fear a year of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota there was an interview with the times it was a woman in Minnesota who said you know\nIf these people aren't stopped they're liable to come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabin that that uh people have is summer homes and staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll the these these these are these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk the thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this is this is what's here is the magnification of deep seeded American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country you know in violent\n[noise] we've got a call from El Paso Texas said John is calling a John my understand if you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew or they take my call you work with a a little militia down here where mobilized and on the order to make sure that this caravan not make it into our country ... ... people in the media have been doing a thick of your rhetoric at a press\nAnd that we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate has its good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement a in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air or we are going to return however to one of the comments that uh that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star\nA and think about the question nasheed flag questions about\nStart a and think about the question she flagged questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he had been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here's a or just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air uh and she called President Trump his man he advised as a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional liar\nYes the president is speaking is true see as the president is ... doing it intentionally to incite surfing people which would include left leaning journalist and most of the left leaning politicians and so what is happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they say oh wow the president's lying and his face is basically laughing at him okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria if you\nCall the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your fear of rules\nSo Daniel veiled as ... a compares sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders as hall monitors\nA recently also a trolley or worse all of a a buzzfeed posts a piece where he says look depressed is participating in that cycle of um\nDisseminating miss truths or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says to the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believe that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking\nHis statements what do you make of that\nThere are a lot of thoughts there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there is insufficient\nFact checking true telling you about the president's live I don't think it has regularly the case that\nThe media is is incessant incessantly seizing on Trump's false statements at rallies or making a big deal about them and fueling a media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\n\nSupport for unfolding comes from the listeners have W.

Confederate flag almost literally Mr Stewart I'm but I think you know perhaps even more interesting is the the more subtle\nUh efforts that a Republican superPACs and candidates are trying to make in various races um they are in several cases trying to tie their democratic opponents to terrorism I'm In one case a there are in in New York state they are emphasizing the fact that a Rhodes Scholar who's running for the Democrats\nUm was once a rapper who use profanity in his in his political music um and and so these I think are quite an subtle\nAppeals to bigotry or or generously racial resentment um and it's either that they feel that this is a a compelling message to many voters or that this is their best message I'm In a in a very challenging for them\nAnd Kenya built there there are also been questions of whether race informs some of the arguments we've heard about of of voting rights and voter access a during this election season or a subject we've covered on this show but nonetheless one that keeps having new fresh fresh uh revelations every every day or so I think about the Georgia race how does race in form\nA or what's happening governor's race what's happening in terms of voting rights there\nWell I think ... races a huge factor as it often is in southern racism and many other races um you know we have a a a female African American candidate running from the Democrats\nOf yes we have a a white male candidate running for the Republicans\nThe white male ... also happened to be the secretary of state of the state I'm basically in charge of election issues\nUh and as usual we found that many of the people who are being a you know drop from the rolls or otherwise being blocked or discouraged from voting are disproportionately members of minorities particularly African Americans\nAnd so in in multiple ways it is impossible to separate race from from that George gubernatorial race\nHope you'll join us for all things considered coming up at four o'clock this afternoon here on W.

was part of what defined her adult life it didn't define her but it to find a lot of how she lived her life she was you know in the times that she was in sobriety she was struggling to stay there and when she wasn't in sobriety she was living in a lot of darkness so I Want\nWhen she wasn't in sobriety she was living in a lot of darkness so I wanted her obituary to reflect both the love and the

talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose a chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to pose a youth are called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis is because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right we're either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide is the number one source of accidental death and our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl are that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um [noise]\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable another won't won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we could take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nAh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late\nOur needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication or you'll get a prescription for it and that prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America\nYou can get a prescription for buprenorphine and Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who need it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of that ... percent eight percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things are and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that will lead Matty stand incarcerated multiple times they never received\nI Believe it would not have been incarcerated multiple times they never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being treat you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you'd have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that [noise]\nBurlington and you know on ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absence base which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve steps you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know\nI'm brand and just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family were not he was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking methadone or if you're taking the pornography and while you're not really cream clean you're not sober right\nWhich is just you know there's so much evidence that show that the treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and so denying people access or making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say to people you know what like you can't have the drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\nDo that like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what good is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of there will be a crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduced uh the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town and the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict I used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on buprenorphine for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an an adult but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine\nWhen it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality is a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking a medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nKnow we've been getting fascinating and stronger response from listeners uh uh as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like it\nIt's a ... as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not she used to have either he post on our website ah she's on her Facebook page\nAnd and wrote addictions lifelong vitamin seats that few respect relies can't be cured by Taylor combination only love respect understanding and radical forgiveness and patients can cure it or another comment on our website a one or the name near as nine

level where I can read watch TV et cetera and get some website I've tried so many non drug treatments and non opioid drugs\nBut uh nothing or have helped I I Will point out that we do have a

now from Norwich, Connecticut\nNow deer or go ahead please\nOr how you doing today okay let me thank you for having me on on what the other guy the other gentleman just said just cut it threw me off because you cannot put somebody who has diabetes\nLike my grandmother had for twenty five years in the same category with someone you know who who who has an opioid addiction I mean there's ... there's ... of course is more than one way with people end up getting hooked on these things a lot of times that happens on them your accident a crowds today and they're given a prescription and after the fact that end up becoming addicted to the medication\nSome people which either they don't need to take the medication and more prepared as someone who do continue to need to take the medication for pay my for my personal experience alone in ten years a bit of knowledge I lost about nine people\nIn those kids right All right out of high school some of them got to see Thirty years old you

I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program we have no funneling some are ERs into MIT\nPrograms I'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so nowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live uh whether you get this lifesaving treatment\nOr not but we we have a a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstruction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia\nOr you know stretching from the you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast uh in industries where they once could rely on study jobs\nAnd that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a bit by adults on what's being pushed to well what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and\nSo ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked them in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a drawl or she goes oh you won't be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around\nHim in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard at heart a central ...\nOpioids were prescribed three hundred six hundred percent that the ... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nAnd recently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex is our said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic as you cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty seventeenth of march twenty Eighteen according\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly ... trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction\nTelling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nBrindle pose a you know the number of Americans dying from opioids are related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total he died in the Vietnam War but it's a secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this\nWell first of all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual ... before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in their duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders they want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like Mary Weinberger here in Burlington or a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nUh I'd like to think bad for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need\nThe medication Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day ... and what it does as you get to the judge off your back and get your mom off your back\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair in America that's about sound public health policies\nThat can you just take one moment and describe for us what opioids just briefly what opioids due to the brain why are they so dangerous\nYeah so um once you get addicted to these drugs it's it's people I mean I watch over and over and my book people lose\nThat's coming up Sunday Morning at seven thirty this is W.

critical habitat for endangered green sea turtle than monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures in here and now that orbit to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant for the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical because the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis was low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where the turtles 'cause I'm big their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest one that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtle nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this was very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo there was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it price for the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs\nA new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many\nHuh you knew this island was low lying it was Sandy lease and did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured I'm that this island under the threat of the level rise maybe had another decade or\nTwo or three but certainly by mid century um it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very a strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that [noise]\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands are at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um so that's just an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category such last year hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's down to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nThe trade when waves\nMay push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago we are currently\nIn a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the filing a don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us\nYes thank you\nAnd on the conversation now with connections to climate is one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of ... according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the pricing economic growth has quoted driven into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chow dreams the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because we're focused on gross causes us to prioritize\nThe wrong things\nAre lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in and start sustainability\nAid in extra activism than there is in rent and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policy shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economic\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates\nWhat they mean something like oh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do a nice pair of comparison right I'm a very high growth rates in China we are very high growth aids in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently ...\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beams then meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like when you give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what anyone\nWho is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nI'm going to not necessarily caused all the changes that I Am saying it but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is to sort of rise of the other sort of reinvigorated laughed or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nAnother would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand vision or this is the group's cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of ego um sustainable society from the ground up meaning what oh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build\nA sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing\nUm but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right that are trying to put really a democratic control as necessary medium through which this management as possible so that's a very a local uh respond um their national responses\nLittle change in programming today because of breaking news we're airing here and now here on W.

composer and guitarist bill for his ill is a singular talent to all of a collaboration as we can just playing with the wrong mild circuit writer tree on the west coast built Brazil has worked with the LA philharmonic Elvis Costello Paul Simon and many others\nBut on his latest album called music is built Brazil goes it alone he played every instrument the album's a blend of earlier work to new competitions one of the new pieces change in the air\n\nOr\nUsing is refund the phrase music is good to monitor the album hit the top of the church earlier this year we spoke with Bill for all about the album this spring it appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solo this time around [noise]\nThat's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment are picked up a guitar there was the social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with the guitar it was like this magic wand\nBringing every one together and so all along with the tart has been about interacting with other people\nAll along the guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know there's just the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter alone troop adore when it first thing you know but it's something that sort of\nHanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech collapse that like talk about a nightmare\nSituation if you get only interact with their\nYeah yeah I mean can you touching as long as I've got that in my hands and everything is cool\nAnd so then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself into your well\nThey're not at all yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either because over the years they become\nJust another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just so uncomfortable and it was a drag and I\nSwore I'd never do it again but that meant that now I got to get to get into a year later I tried it again and then I and they kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like [noise] like music [noise]\nWell it seems like every time to talk about time I think for\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSome of the time like that's what comes for a canoe or [laughter] sounds backwards the inspiration for the notes because he said it's a tribute you can eat they should be played in your life and you don't usually get just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know I'd say not\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nCome pretty stars and they made the shrine and that was something I quote unquote row [noise]\nThese behind that book and the album pretty average meat dish or anything when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common court when prior to the recording of this album I was\nPlaying at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing some of the music that I Would record it played that song and a guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of\nJesse James [noise] what what do you talk about something just to the\nPlate you this recording and it was like oh my God that's his name is ... almost exact same\nMalady and then I checked it out and that was like you know it's just an old traditional strong like\nI'd probably hurt the Kingston Trio play it when I was five years old or something like a masters in the navy yard I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's\nYou know it's like a public domain kind of thing and then there's so much music floating around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or it might remembering it or what is it [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI Love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want let's listen to\nThat that that that that\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one for that I played on the guitar that was captured\nFrozen society the\nWay the other ... testing so they're sort of a drone\nOne town\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to like a fire drop\nAuto pedal I think that's really kind of a shaky sound\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for just\nOne so low tar a\n[noise] a\n\n...\n... na\n... ...\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen I mean did you playing ... yeah well they're composing is you know happy now these are\nPiece that they've never feel like they're finished anyway but what I Do to prepare for the album was actually played the night I don't know your every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither ... compositions of mine or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for that whole wheat and that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio\nI didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really do anything when I went in there\nYou know for companies you it sounds like you would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentional\nWell but that's when this really happened so I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming you jump off a cliff\nAnd you just starts whining and that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take the chance to but I say jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen if you play a wrong no\nWell you know you get older thrill but you know get banked up too much [laughter] what would you like it takes a lot on\nHere there's that one Monica James which I wrote for my\n[noise] first time I recorded that song was was just about a month after she was born there was my first trip being away from her going to Oslo to record with Paul Les Paul motion\nWe're a little to record with Paul\nMotion drunk [noise] had this song\nTitled we\nPlayed this song called motions for older so that's where the song", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "26"}
