one eight hundred for two three eight to five find the eight hundred for two three talk a Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um\nYou're telling us is very interesting story about a Saudi couple young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if I if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly\nThat they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers a ... and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of late the reporter the uh with\nConnections between the hijackers and his family but with the FBI give you that report\nNo er and after attempting to get access to the report we uh\nWe which was some journalists and myself\nA ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act or to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three a flight students and the Saudi family\nOr the judge rejected that as being a on\nBelievable or they even said that uh they uh had a uh a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily uh directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages\nOf information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven survey of the situation in Sarasota of with the judge then to determine what which of those eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages of can be made available to the American public okay\nName I Want to stay to step back here though because of the ... you're right to those eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota not yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before uh\nAre available to the public in any way shape or form but even before\nOr the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping office to even see\nSome of some of these reports and that a ... and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOh I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative and tracked job at one point a shortly after the\nSituation in Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a\nLogan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there are an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we were wasting our time and that I should\nA shot up and go oh you were the\nHair of the nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow the lead about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers and it it it almost finds belief senator\nWell and it gets it gets worse uh so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director of the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so\nI did uh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again\nI was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nWe knew we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and and I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from\nA you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and and and you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession\nInformation it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this uh\nUh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in orange park\nObama had run in two thousand and eight in orange park on his opposition to the war in Iraq and had raised questions about the about Saudi Arabia and why it was a more a focus of attention\nBut uh in ... fighter that nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now\nA President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darn wings of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president or has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no uh\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick call here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official reports so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this thought um that no one no official reports saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is coach as nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already cited the\nOne situation where prince band or who is the ambassador Saudi Arabia to the United states or was involved in financing a persons who played a critical role in uh nine eleven [noise] [noise]\nWell let's go to a caller here Charlie is calling from New Orleans Louisiana Charlie you're on the air\nI like all levels of grab my question is Saudi Arabia is obviously a big

from Dallas texas is Dr Benjamin Greenberg he's a professor in the department of neurology and your therapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern medical center is also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system\nAnd he's already treated eight patients with acute ... mile a mile latest this year Dr Greenberg welcome to implant\nThank you might not happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also we are are are part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute ... it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults\nAre there are multiple ways to damage\nAdults are there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen every other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the enter a viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an honor of ours and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms or in some children who are being infected with and you say that and we started started seeing a spike beginning in two thousand four teams so\nUh but to enter the virus wasn't wasn't meeting could be seen symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognized\nAnd that the symptoms of syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which\nWas described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical\nA with a few unique features between them the polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but\nWe think are there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern where we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes for these ah\nOutbreaks in the late summer early fall and what's notable is that the virus that has received the most attention\nUm which is within the family of inner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins\nWinner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus\nIn any of these cases when testing has been done in a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThese enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but ... but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccine for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay I'm a research just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path and developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine\nWe're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for and so where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials\nThat we think we have the right culprit and it turns out that ah the virus or family or viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy\nAnd so often will have children who have the syndrome of ... test negative based on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for but it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um when we would test\nThe spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating their spinal cord and causing damage\nAnd affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus or to find and so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so\nIf you have a child with paralysis in you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the final quarter the spinal fluid because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body\nAnd so we're trying to sort out the same process to use for the editor of ours is now the\nThe reassuring part of this\nRelative to the history of polio virus is in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties when we had\nTens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody will become paralyzed and so it's it's virulent sits ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\nSo very very low rate that very low rate and so we are be we're trying to be very reassuring to\nTickets are available at live each de saint Pete dot com this is Wu ... eighty nine point seven Tampa saint Petersburg Sarasota broadcasting from the University of

you\nAll the time for [laughter] this is from off\nYou know while back we had a guy here in almost the exact same situation Theresa money or keep the company for\nWhat happened well from\nWe're voting to be armed self inflicted gunshot [noise] because he really regretted not taking that money\nA little black humor there about the pressures that telecom valley exact may face a but in reality things can get a little strange and most definitely uncomfortable if not out and out inappropriate because\nIn this next time you're going to hear Bloomberg anchor Emily Chang diving into the ... like world of Silicon Valley she did that in her book row Tokyo which was published earlier this year and she told Business Insider in February about the shocking details of some tech women's day to day lives\nI don't want to get into a hot tub and pitch investors might that and that's all holding up their what women want to do that while wearing a bikini and these things are really happening\nSo that's a Emily Chang are talking about one of the things that may happen air Doug happen in Silicon valley now with the ... the thing about your book that I think it is the deepest point that you make it how Silicon Valley views it's actual employees an actual workers\nTell tell me more about that because part of what you wrote seems I'm very familiar to me in terms of how industrialists of\nOld also solve their workers\nRight only I think it's actually even worse so the the view\nToday in Silicon valley is that workers are sexually disposable\nWidgets you you their fuel coal you throw in a steam engine to keep it going so you you hire them you you burn them out turn them out and just hire again and you're just high turnover and high burn out I'm\nOddly enough it's counter to what Silicon Valley was even as recently as when I started writing about Silicon Valley in the late eighties\nAt that time the gold standard was something called the H. P. way right which was really human centric really employ centric it was a great place to work and to stay um ...\nPackard graduate Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they had a profit share quite a bit with their employees I mean was it was the standard of an end looking would turn into a blue chip companies right no longer but [laughter]\nBut it was at the top of the heap once the garage that ... that the bill and David founded HP is a national landmark\nRight and and the the one thing I I loved about it too they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your family's in there and they view\nHave a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your family's in there and they view the company as a family and they\nThe two of them would serve all the hamburgers you know they would sort of certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or\nA you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers that were really much very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies and eighties you had this sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people was a great place to work if you landed a job in one of these places like oh\nFantastic and that has radically changed and that's no longer you know [noise] that kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah well it didn't just jump in here saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of employees are in this day and age so let me just get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\nFlow\nThat was saying that the nine eleven employers ... an electric when you're a transactional issue can be turned on the news fine but it's not the start and there's nothing there's nothing new or just returning back before\n... ... it's silly things are unless you're willing to nurture\nRobert thank you so much for your call a deadlines what do you think about that means he's kind of thing when I said earlier that a lot of the sounds really familiar\nIt's it it does in a way I'm ... ... I went back in ... I'm going to read books by industrial is a of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was the c._e._o. of IBM\nAnd a leaky Iacocca so it's not the rubber bands but and and Henry Ford obviously was not a nice guy yeah how are you get to the very end of his memoirs and there's a lot of shopping you're like\nOh my God whoa whoa whoa but be before that part of it it's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for as many human beings as I can\nAnd to treat them really well um he at one point had his stock or around and try to find jobs that disabled people can do because those people were pushed out of the workforce by me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on find me all the jobs you could do if you were blind\nMake a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can ah they can make make a living\nYeah but it does so this is the key difference though right that there was a time\nI'm a ... not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company\nAnd doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be but ... you know some time in the seventies and eighties we'd American Capitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders so would that be\nAnd and I guess what I'm saying what I'm Wondering is it in your book are you writing that you think that that Silicon Valley because it's full of some of these billion dollar valued companies that may or may not be turning a profit that essentially they put they put all the shareholder value creation like on hyper ... that it it is by far the most important thing\nI'm a of anything that these companies can do and and that's the pernicious than it is that what you're saying okay\nHyper capital and it it's you have Nineteen Seventy the turning point is Milton Friedman publishes his famous essay about shareholder capitalism in every CEO goes this is great all I have to do is return a money to investors\nThis is great all have to do is return a money to investors time my own compensation to stock price and anything I can do to make that happen is great got the pension bond you know usually all in involves hurting employees\nAnd but so you had four stakeholders you had a customer's employees the community and investors and Milton Friedman just double investors come first and now\nIts investors are are the only ones who matters or you have companies in Silicon valley that have run for years have never made a profit don't treat their employees well deliver what they call MVP minimum viable product\nUm dodged taxes will get apple and Google hiding all this money offshore and not paying taxes 'em\nAll to benefit investors companies were NBC's have become fabulously rich a founders had become fabulously rich but the company itself is not profitable yeah and so you have treated employees very well um so it's a really inside a ton of version of capitalism\nOkay well let's get another call here we're speaking with dandelions who's author of lab rats how Silicon Valley made work miserable for the rest of us Marge is calling from Lebanon, Connecticut marred you're on the air\nHello thank you um\nI Want to say that I worked for a large insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut for thirty six years my father also retired from this company\nHe worked there forty years all the time I was growing up I Do not remember him working overtime he was home at five o'clock for supper every day we had weekends to go away and so forth now they'll they'll\nTwelve years I worked in a wonderful unit I was able to accomplish every project they gave me on time or before target date and they re arrange things five\nJoin us for Florida matters on the radio Sunday Morning at seven thirty or right now at W.

millennials and young people who reject current tech culture will they reinvented or find another way to make a living let's go to Steve who's calling from Boston, Massachusetts Steve you're on the air\nA guy that I have to take issue with some of the things that are your your perspective and I'll give you my own\nMy own background I worked here for ten years for intel uh a good portion of that time I was actually working in the VCR investing in companies in Israel and then I left a trail and uh uh I work in our\nDuring your what your caller safari\nSilicon are reluctant says so far as in Israel that the people around the world and showing them what's going on in\nIsrael and my my you're my mark prospective is is that most of the companies that I'm In touch with my experience when I was doing some investing was that the best companies are the most successful companies were the ones who really put the emphasis of the employees because\nBasically the start of culture the culture is is grounded in a knowledge in bringing your brain power bringing you know racial bringing ideas\nThe human capital now yeah\nAnd that's the human capital and they want to invest in that the best ones do invest in it do well in my experience is is that the people who are working in those environments are energized and incentivized uncompensated and enjoy it and feel like you're actually making contribution\nWill Steve thank you so much for your call let's getting dance response you\nKnow I I think you know I are completely in agreement I think there are there are companies doing\nI I think you know Ira completely in agreement I think there are there are companies doing that and and those people are happy um um but let's say ... or you can see everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right and route Amazon warehouses are not like that um\n... when he mentioned I'm working in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company\nAnd um it was true story and I thought it would want to become an even received a call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise] anyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well let me just ask you briefly a are we ... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company going this way it is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the bitter with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much\nBut at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of\nThis I Want to do because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right it ... if not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's delivered that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down was quickly in order to\nA massage or a profit for that quarter I just cut a workforce they go to church you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question is new to you and yet is that in trying to shift perspective a little here\nUm for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowering them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention now that are kind of the two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech start up that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstrap so they never read any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a ...\nThey have very like uh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policies do I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in\nWhich we can look at you know structurally\nOr how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing\nStart ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples that that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share it's a private company um but they share a olive their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build up more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that\nThey are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for 'em and then I'd also say like\nA again companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone has invested in the success of and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top um I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team\nOr or just say multiple teams because I run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bowls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by this time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like says his long Hitler Hitler yeah hate to have you have your life now ... ah there are a lot more\nCallers who want to get to hear but then ... were quick thought from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you ... we we totally agree and and um\nThere's a a another company called Base Camp that are used in Chicago and software company and I I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about any and and that is one Base Camp never took any PC\nTo they're not really obsessed with hyper growth are growing at an incredible rate they believe in slow growth\nThey are profitable they charge money for their software and they make a profit they have no interest in going public they want nothing to do with Wall Street and when I looked through another list of companies that have parental you've been

A. M. U. dot org\nFactor that common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back on some of the um some of the things that they submitted\nThat didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various toxic stories that weren't\nSudan and one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when Fred Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more\nThan devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay\nTaxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed ridiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a\nValuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same amount when they had a charitable donation um\nWhere they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go hide they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS then that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer rough [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS hasn't doors sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorneys I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this scratcher attained annuity trust which is a\nFormal name for the mechanism through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where a daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so\nFather to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose when pat invoices so Donald Trump in his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face\nUm and so those kind of things on a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair it's also scotch and many many successful people every

get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the ...\nWe get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this is their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS it's um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes he get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality of the ah the ... now and again\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts but we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and\nEventually they come to a settlement and we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm I owe county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it sort of a um a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or or their statute of limitations that are involved there are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those\nHave since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer\nWe have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities who say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Sudan which said arrangement\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the anchorman not paid tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of the kinds of stands out is it how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed\nMillions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSugar that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a of money he own oath to lenders\nUm and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling ships took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help him make that payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they they inflate it they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially you could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that's out so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities I'm another authorities could be looking at um\nWhat did the food they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n... federal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute it that the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county\nThey were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that and yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs she stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Sudan and they're\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made billionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire\nBut what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that\nBut I think it's an important um narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune\nUm and where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas you know there's been stories that from a but it's come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\nMore at the palladium dot com bubble you us after eighty

a scientific and technical for sex tree at the embassy\nAnd it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces\nOr I I and a very broad capabilities\nOut of Sergei Skripal joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was involved today in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approached hue and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well that are described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the geo you as being the kind of stay the guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to pay me ... an exam\nAnd he goes through that later that year he started at the what's cool limited to diplomatic academy which is effectively ... school in Moscow wet you've spent four years uh doing everything from you know the real um spine noble tradecraft stuff of agent meats and Kansas of items\nUh ... means of communications firm microscopes to secret writing said you know encrypted email all that stuff\nI through
