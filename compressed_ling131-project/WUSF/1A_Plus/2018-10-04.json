Capitol Hill is John Brennan the hand he senior congressional reporter for Politico John welcome\nTo employees bar magnet so first of all tell us here I think there's a lot of questions around

a secure facility in the capital and senators and some limited number of staff members can go read the report or be briefed on a report by staffers\nI see so I'm I'm seeing here that they're going to

Kavanaugh's testimony that he gave before\nThe Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says uh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now and we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece in titled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that sat on the radio dot or the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay anything so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through\nA couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific phrases that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle drinking game has applied three glasses and trying and you're quite quarters you know her supporters care\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nUm because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouth during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a free some\nAnd ah it's a it's a sexual ... and uh in\nBrett Kavanaugh's testimony she tried to paint himself he tried to read them just as important as because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself as a kind of innocence in high school that he was a Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen\nHe helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the\nMore important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern in which\nBrett Kavanaugh invaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college uh says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want to know that and so he didn't admit\nOr any of the things that suggested that he did actually know a powder and think about sex in high school and things that would make for the occasion more credible\nUh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh um said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to\nI'm said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a PDF and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later\nBut but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see\nUm I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nWho has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper part in this moment is that he can't he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what my I I don't know I'm just what might be like kind of a ... things that Seventeen year old boys say to each other\nBecause it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\nThe problem is that there's this thing called a sworn oaths and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh is a federal judge and he's speaking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you would look more credible in fact affect entirely the point\nThe reason that he lied about these things\nI'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it was hard ah him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what he said\nI watch these hearings because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible\nThat though she may have been assaulted it was not break having all and I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of a stringing came everybody knew\nWell those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person who's really interested in the truth and to me saying statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew as an example of bad faith analysis\nAnd in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a meant what he says it means which I find kind of felt the mind it honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have in Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have\nThe I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three uh but that means he's lying and the additional proof as a nation's ... Davis who went to high school in the DC area in two thousand eight\nThat's not proof ... and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that in the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about their drinking game\nNathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\nYeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing of the proceeds for having us testimony you know having to discuss it I really don't want to\nAh the procedure for having us testimony you know having to discuss it I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and the most major lives are much much much more significant\nAh like saying I never attended a gathering with the people for ... cents now on his calendar on Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that\nFord says he attended a gathering with when he said all of the people she says we're there to say it didn't happen in fact one of the ... and he's he ... he says Ford's friend Leyland Kaiser\nSays that they didn't happen that's not what layering Kaiser says laid when Congress bet she believed Dr Ford which means it did happen it was they misrepresented actually it would be awesome if she believes belief does not mean that it did happen just to be what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that strongly that it didn't happen\nShe believes that it happened right her opinion is the forward is telling the truth\nRight not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says what they say it didn't happen that falls that's a false statement that the full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's faulty did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to\nFirst of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week or in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a show that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that are professor Ford named\nNone of those gatherings record of a group of people that Dr Ford as far as my calendar show I was very precise about lifting was they're very precise\nAnd then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that are the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happen that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said\nI just want you emphasize all four witnesses who were allegedly\nThe event of said it didn't happen\nNow on like a green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements at the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection\nWhich is categorically different than saying it didn't happen\nThat this week on Florida matters\nWe certainly hope you'll tune in for Florida matters on the radio so the morning at seven thirty you don't have to wait until then you can hear the program right now at our website W us up news dot O.

Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again\nWe're not looking at the past but what he said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court and we're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my editor green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more a moment from last week this is in an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator ... are Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWhere there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I don't know I remember what happened and\nI think you're probably a beer sir um and so you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened it's you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know I view\nThat exchange went on and of course as people remember judge Kavanaugh after a break came back and apologize to senator ... and I agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because\nI think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the day after it was or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breast ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that\nI think the fact that he apologized to fire costs\n... what's your response to that I think the fact that he apologized to fire ... are shows that he felt that he had come across too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize I was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break\nBecause I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and\nYou know this is a really tough process you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize when she they had this but I found to be very lovely reconciliation moment that I can show that he was human 'cause really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech\nTo make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person is going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system\nThan we are going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robin said cagey\nOr but if she is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen\nWhich is a click away saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so\nI think it's important to remember he's a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWell what on earth so called colloquial I call falls right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I I think cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like\nI'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says I was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the question\nRight and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking it's directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations Brent against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs why it's so important for him to be honest and to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he said look\nI I really yes it might yeah I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the few club like uh because I I drank a lot and you know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's ... classmate for your time to talk to a dozen of his classmates who also say\nThat he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and and as I say that they say that directly we ever his freshman year roommate who said he was a belligerent drunks um we have the uh University of Washington I'm headed the a gynecology oncology department who says I used to drink with Brett\n... it's not credible she said it it's not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes are different from how he remembered\nThe night before that's what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were but you know by the way they will watched him all say that's just not credible he he he ... school year broke up a he's part of the city club tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nYou know in March judges memoir wasted huge huge depicted as bart ... who you're picked everywhere um\nAnd he wouldn't even admit that he was barred Kavanaugh um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will that's full you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also in the book\nLet's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on your Nathan\nI thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did drink the brick Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted\nThe allegations about him one that wasn't true I also talk the claim that there was a Clinton revenge screen going on\nThe claim that there was a Clinton revenge thing going on\nAs over the top accusations bought\nIdled sakes the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not or you can be sure he led regardless of if you believe Dr Ford or not I don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lie to Congress back when he was doing a lot of attention from Iraq and\nAnd none of the Republicans are cared about or wanted to and then I don't think they're doing now in measuring the group of ... or people supporting each of them all I followed it very ironic that they have to freeze\nStand on we're capping off because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker and my experience was that the political slogan used to cover up on trustworthy person\nWell about look people there was a hashtag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whomever it is that you expressed support for Nathan\nI'm okay I'll I'll I'll open up that far but we I feel a lot of yard signs saying a stand with Walker and white that probably is not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was it was kind of law I'm like oh my gosh okay over again\nNathan thank you for your call and it took me let me turn back to you I think Nathan broader point is if he doesn't feel that no matter you know\nWhether that that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that to judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but in ... he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress at all or congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confront him anyway and uh he he objects to that but what's your response to Nathan\nActually what nation is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I as a more trying to see that more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that that for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink in high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he sat in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says to leave when Carter was there to also said I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr foreign clearly described a different type of gathering et cetera\nBut like we are talking about what is the use of going through things that can't be proven from years ago and I think we even saw this um and and that was last Republicans were trying to sift through this and said we need to hear from people who are coming forward with these allegations\nHow do we start to do this because this is going to look like a political circus so they got a prosecutor who is experiencing bringing forth cases of sex crimes she came out with a report which I didn't see mentioned\nUh in in Nathan's piece at all or where she said I found this weaker than a he said she said case based on inconsistencies in her testimony and so I think it's important to be fair saying look\nYou can find inconsistencies of people are human they were talking about things to the best of their recollection and when you're being questioned in front of every camera in the nation or before a panel senators whether your Christine forward or Iraq having all that is an intimidating\nPlace to be in and I think really when we come down to is if he's telling the truth\nTo get sort of bend wasteful dot org this is W. us after eighty nine

that metal and let's start with you\nSue ... is a school without a Greek life so that does end up shaping a lot of what our drinking she looks like but people will mostly gravitate towards hard alcohol um especially I found during our freshman sophomore years when alcohol might be a little bit harder to get hold of because we're not legally able to buy it\nAnd there is a very strong blackout culture where people are generally drinking to the blackout were brought up that's the whole that's the whole point\nGetting to the blackout were brought up that's the whole that's the whole point well it's not entirely the whole ...\nI wouldn't say the goal or at a point but it is not stigmatized it's a part of our language you're very common to have someone say oh I Can't even remember what

University School of law\nAnd jak McCarthy's with us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's a Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow a and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you where it\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website ah for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town my residence is surrounded by college housing\nThursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students can racks of course the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed the shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this this story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus or drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think uh what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were\nEven going back Thirty years ago if I might say quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campus was based on a scores scores of studies the overarching in irrefutable\nFindings of a massive amount of research now is that\nFirst of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIt is significant and sometimes quite large and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old and those are compared to any other each population and compared to non college\nYoung adults are the same age ... this is the heart of of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk those levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains\nHaving said that even given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of [noise]\nAmongst college students the best measures of\nA of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers and it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on a campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched\nOne quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consumed so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious\nProblem can is some significant agree yeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe you said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that well uh sometimes\nToday with the word a binge drinking is used and typically what is used most commonly in measures are measures such as using [noise]\nFive or more drinks that have setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences more recent decades that we've have better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking\nFive or four more in a two hour period because that is sitting sometimes for college students my mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up to a high risk level such as a point away which is the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving when a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas\nAnd that's a so if we're talking about drinking a five or more in a two hour period\nWithout intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think is interesting\nAbout what the difference may potentially be if we are going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades and that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I've spoken to my parents or people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles outside or whatever he needs to get hold of\nEasily available like basically right off of that year freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be more experienced their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[laughter] yeah um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer um depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for um hell gates before football game tended to be more beer\nA deer Hetty whereas party toasted at fraternities for you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric so I think that definitely is a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with ... like they're going to a tailgate or something it's definitely going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that a hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry are carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient than just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay we Perkins I mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that\nTheir friends okay when Republicans I mean you've been studying this for several decades DC that same trend\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on what the particular context you might see more beer being consumed or or more hard liquor [noise]\nBut uh the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in green alcohol being poured for big parties uh that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]\nUh and uh still nationwide beer is the drink of choice although uh uh in some sectors and some schools are some hard liquor may have in increased popularity\nBut it's when we use the word trends of I we're just not seeing major trends without regard of and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all\nYou know they can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly of heart alcohol can can enter your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing ten shots in a row and that sort of thing but\nIf you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise] uh I think we have to temper the the notion that oh it is hard liquor is it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem but it's a mixed picture\nSo let's just that we have so many college when I joined us hollers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask Wesley Perkins one more question here because you know look I get it there maybe some people listening to that saying lie all the shot\nI mean you you just make it sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying\nOh my God there's not much drinking on college campuses maybe it's not I mean it is a demonstrably different than it was Thirty years ago and if not what the big deal jak ed was Perkins because I mean I think there's an argument to be made that yes we've had a lot of drinking on college campuses for many decades\nFor free that's good [laughter]\nSupport for on point comes from the listeners of WB you are Boston and from exact science is offering Colo guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening

drinking culture today and we're joined by Madeleine DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's the first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nJak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eighty five hundred eight hundred and four to three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about three to eat\nAnd the tweeted we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with the heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress but let me just\nLet me just talk to Madeline and Brianna and jak here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress 'cause I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to go with your friends and have a couple of drinks I brought it was saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks\nThere's there's not like people are going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight like I think it's some more of like you just it catches up with like you go to a party and there's like\nThere's alcohol there and you started drinking drinking and then you black\nTo a party and there's like there's all call there you are drinking and drinking and then you know but there's a million different ways relieves stress and the button you know it's not\nA comment one I Would say OK so Brenna against Steven ... says ah why do you find a shocking to you that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a ... century city you go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or other things that are laying down on you know\nI'm or ultimately jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and you grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and saying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not now in law school an undergrad when maybe your responsibilities weren't as much as they are for me now um\nYou might go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to draw a different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing\nBecause at least in my license blackout just kind of used almost colloquially like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're garlic as to what the comment on mine said\nI don't like I don't know that\nWe are all blocking out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have done before All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're only ever on a\nHigh thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already graduated from college and here in all and the drinking scene in as crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street and that kind of like drive the party scene of the nation\nBut I just feel like sometimes people are a little machine to speak truthfully about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's a choice\nTo black out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they do it on purpose they just got to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to blackout or not or it's more that\nYou get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when\nThings with what we can with Josh comment on it are happening and maybe people saying that oh maybe he doesn't remember or maybe that's like just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lie and basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the kegs and everything like that has to be a blackout and from what your guest\nAre they speaking they ... it's like corroborating that if\nMy ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right times\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy we'll turn to you on the uh I mean you heard the question what do you say\n[noise] um I definitely suited for the blackouts especially I think we're missing important too to some people do they have like bigger issues the nobody knows about\nSome people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about so sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems and I think that's also like another reason people are blocking out up there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um mass and seem alcohol because they are trying to cover up those issues with Republicans what what's your response to that question\nWell I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to a ... bar point of view first fall [noise] ah that's only as a um segment of the population but you observe the people who are the most extreme and you go home and or talk with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or if you had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise] and uh we have millions of who are stories about them it can be funny it can be said it can be scary ... and so forth but we talked about it is what most of the talk is about\nAnd understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances but when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at an abstinence\nBut you can think of thousands of words for being drunk that's reflects the talked and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions that this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted ... not a big deal but in fact\nThe blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of\nOf a sexual assault uh our our our ... serious problems in there but the it's it's legitimate as a segment of the population but so many people\nDon't speak out about it at our against it because they think well it is enormous what most college students do ... it's the same phenomena of of ah students saying\nWell most students do this but not me that is a very common pattern and because we just don't talk about the majority who are normal and it's not just from survey research we can demonstrate this we demonstrate this with anonymous B. C. testing on campuses campuses around the country who have done this in shown that\nThere may be twenty percent coming home late night with\nA intoxicated and the rest are coming home and not having consumed alcohol or had consumed very little so it's it's the the biological evidence in Missouri ovens is\nOverwhelming but it's still a serious problem well let's go to Marie who's calling from Hartford, Connecticut you're on the Murray\nAnd there are just wanted to comment on that seemingly close relationship affects your thoughts on college campuses and the alcohol like diarrhea revolt graduate and she confided in me that her circle of girlfriends ah six or seven a battle\nThis is W.

confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim God at and Christ\nIt was during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim gone debt and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of of Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that

packed with drama including both in our owes near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's Monica to bolus here she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics she's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be\nA well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start a let's start with the nitty gritty who is ...\nUh let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him as ... as a retired\nArmy captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades now\nUm but despite having sat in Congress hurts so much time and he he shows\nOpen loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of left us\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but\nIn the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd those messages um are resonating a lot\nMore with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a\nRunoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth and that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face\nWith this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to twenty fifty and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people just wrote a Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... and our with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for a Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him I'm In that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T.\nUm he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the P. T. far less though he's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the painting currently it very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three\nI'm twenty can wind up party really did take the ... center left fan so the party at south now is very much hard last um the candidate though is that um that being said that the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that had been migrating too far right extremist both an hour oh\nI'm In the anti P. T. vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to the president but about who vote or not you know the fact\nWe're going to talk about corruption we are going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to the idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking ...\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls or what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politician thing it both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided ... uh eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time or one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote\nWill leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the valley of devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we'd both so I'm not a winning more like the according to the late disposes that we'd go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative to because there is not going to be a military coup in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers were themes\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way I mean\nIt was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both denaro he he almost\nDied by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him politically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful\nUm because the plan by the more centrist candidates in this race was to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both denaro as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nPublic sympathy they really had to tone down or in some cases eliminate totally they're attacked it's also allowed both in our road to stay fairly quiet and not articulate his plans what he would do if he gets elected as much as he otherwise would have had to I mean he either as a huge\nCBC is cute comes your weight and I ate right after fresh air you're on your NPR station\nSupport for

this weekend's presidential election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections\nMy guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council of either ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your messages wanting listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... and our people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will go for anything that is in part of the Workers Party now Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and abroad\nOffensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but how old are you will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time gets a little bit because it isn't important to put into context you think\nThe most important I'm finding have ... or a car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty six teams and at that time I'm president Dilma\nHe's sixteen and at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Britain Herald leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen and she was president at the time [noise]\nUm she wouldn't even peaked in twenty sixteen\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts with the fact that age he had lost control of her of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political party that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe wasn't she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing um but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that she suffered\nWas really very much politically motivated by the need that some of the political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in prison now\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instilled defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party had been let's say unfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMatt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states\nApollo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America but of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nBut now terrible recession heritable corruption what happened in Brazil where was to Brazil that that hosted the Olympics and was and was on the way up\nRocks and Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build the country or one of the major betrayal just besides the workers are too far to the was led\nBy a man born in poverty a that to build this very successful ... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a ... a a basic ... riding a wonderful wave and international economics producer of commodities had the wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable\nWell a than reality hit a\nRuler made a very bad choice to his successor\nA and a a lot of a shock to came\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that she'll be positive and all of this\nWe cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by residents ah and another thing that I just spoke to ensure the positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money\nIn Brazil is basically broke and we have run off the money\nUh all that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be called from that from a ... reality ... basis where the government says run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why how they plan to go from the ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well if you look around right\nNow at the field of cat it there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on an inspiring um the vast majority of\nPeople here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that\nIs is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned Todd [noise]\nAnd the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world but\nThis democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn that could involve the\nCurtail month of civil civil liberties and and and other things I I in my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nI guess just blew me away I mean it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was a real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and you know\nMaybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now\nWill Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian state representative democracy\nIs the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us\nWhy are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil ... is another ... he's an air to wanna ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America\nAll of them are low for their corruption their narcissism\nAnd a total lack of democracy\nAnd Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once\nThat are ... is a breeze\nIt's been said more than once that a ... is a Brazilian version a Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump through those right wings are both populists are

Obama and concluded what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election to lead to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate\nDonald Trump that he is the death knell of this party so what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted\nWhat's he think he I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and hid in during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe\nIf you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence him but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham our ...\nKennan last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle\nI usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah ... what he's describing your ticket splitting yet to be and political science they do those voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal it's All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve Cornell you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are I'm led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then times speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the euro postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\nYeah that that in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say what what was the big deal the deal was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nWe are committed to providing index weather coverage on the radio and the mobile app Florida storms the Florida public radio emergency network is supported by Wu us citizens property insurance on line\nAt citizens at L.

for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station I Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day\nWe spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how you are seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented or respected leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a\nIf you're a female Republican or at least someone who would describe themselves as\nBroadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead\nHere on one a while we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the night\nSkiing for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on a hill\nBut the hard truth is but not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and gory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see\nThe places that you don't visit [noise]\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd I believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any whole [noise]\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him for for ... before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and in a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place can the president I raise at that point Berkeley sort of Ross Perot [laughter] begging laced with Bush the incoming president in third place buried I was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hardness image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall\nWhich was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows Clinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary ...\nShows Clinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the President's Day yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians\nNow managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality of Iraq Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Rocco bomb it didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has changed just radically changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich in that moment with O'Neill what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time were the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN give seat was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience\nDraw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career as rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or to Donald Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time to Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his had little of I guess he's an anti satellite he doesn't like the black sea those are like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody could have raised this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and we're really staunch right wacko well I'm not even sure if it's right\nIt's just a lack of of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tampa", "day": "04"}
