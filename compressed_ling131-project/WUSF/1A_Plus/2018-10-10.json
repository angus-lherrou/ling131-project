we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un based secure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of the to get a sense about what Nikki Haley fields of her successors at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral ism only on us terms\nSince the secretary general's meeting last year we have found out of the Paris accord when he pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states and determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements\nThe United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivered this message about ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf uh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states joined the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James to read us he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive now the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf seems to read as well come back to them point\nGreat to be back with you Mary how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreement but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said\nShe maintained her independence she struck out a on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable are investor for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surrounded and the international constellation\nSo she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nWell so tell me more about that I mean if you will have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of\nYou know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration acting you and what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I start with the uh on the negative side to withdraw from the climate agreement I think\nThat will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on\nA Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that in every sense her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and vitamin ... and in particular\nSo Colum Lynch up respond to that I mean this is one question that I had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs are there is an administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in the ... of some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI [noise] I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that\nHaley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti you and you know destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and ... on board to sort of recognize the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know she is very much in the her remarks that you just played\nA very much embracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has\nBeen you know food and she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for a an end to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm and she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un\nShe does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she didn't able job and leading the negotiations on I'm sort of a expanding sanctions against North Korea or she has been quite active when some African issues that to others and the administration has shown very little interest in Central African republic the\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know and in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and I are promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her kind of positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and and the way that she's dealt with that issue yeah\nEliana joins in a new uh we've got to let you go here in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that um that there are some things that Nikki Haley that ambassador Haley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to ... you know in her future\nPolitical career because she was a line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that's forever in American politics but but that's a reality that is that she's got a she's got to be wondering about listening both to add ...\nWondering about\nListening both to add ... talk and to ah to call on top\nI I think Nikki Haley I did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be counting her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as a moving the U.S Capitol championing the move of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election and absolutely\nWell ... and White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much you know it's great

for decades eminent objective as I Do go vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this on the case I think for a position on Paris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major uh\nSome moles on her part I realized that those were positions or the president Xi is representing but those are not successes I definitely see us as the country\nHave fallen greatly down and scale of respect around the world I think supporting and apartheid stayed in Israel is going to be go down in history as a major uh\nThe major flaw what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her really stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained your position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nStay with us in on point continues from eleven to noon here on double USF eighty nine point seven will have a new that date and that eleven and often in this is Wu ... news giants NPR\n[noise]

that post at the end of the year what her legacy her track record is that the her two years representing the United states in the UN and what could be next\nFor the next UN ambassador in for American foreign policy as a whole and we're joined today by Admiral James to ... he's a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group and author of the leaders bookshelf\nColum Lynch is also with us he's un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us so let me just get some of them in here where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk who's go to Vivian who's calling from east vessel borough main you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't belong to the party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as\nAs a representative to the un she stood up to\nA lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to a lot of them are we see that characterize Israel as a right wing country and ah\nAnd you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian\nCamp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas and maybe what happened was\nThat she said that they really weren't so bad luck and um that's maybe why she decided to support Israel and moved to Jerusalem\nWill Vivian Vivian let me go let cold respond to your to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nI'm I think you're I think that the characters that isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nAnd came to you know testified before Congress and made in a passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them but\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much\nUh promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much I'm\nA mood by that by that visit 'em what really I think change her view on this was really\nUm the the dispute over the U.S moving\nThe embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem there was a Security Council votes in which um she was a she was you know cast a veto against fourteen ... member she was totally isolated um the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that\nThis sort of notion that the Palestinians were defying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states had really kind of um\nShifted her kind of orientation actually became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience\nWell I'm James ... to someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some contacts uh this first because at the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support in the Trump administration's support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year\nAnd a basket of Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington\nReceived a multiple standing ovations throughout the evening and here's one such moment\nHave sent in an organization like a hundred and Ninety three country\nThe United nations spend half\nAttacking only one country we will not anyhow [noise] that was in March\nOf this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move\nA it's a it's ... it's a embassy to Jerusalem last December the un scheduled a vote on a resolution denouncing that move an investor Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S will be taking names of those who vote against the United states\nThat got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis was extremely ill advised by the Trump Administration by the president and an Vassar Haley I'm kinda surprised but in vascular hairless during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective\nYou know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents they lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council\nYou win some you lose you can't you can't bully your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to ... how do you respond to that\nAgree with Nick burns and I've worked with Nick on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years he's got a a a ... view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years uh gone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partner and friend in the middle east but um friends need to\nOccasionally speak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can\nHelp close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region and that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is\nHow do we close that gap tactically saying things like we're going to take names are is probably not\nTypically saying things like we're going to take names are is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh I bake a U.S up on a on a on a half\nA Hong Kong and maturation and his cabinet I'm a I'm a ... you have comments on our shaped the cost of food as or post yeah uh she said her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is ah it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James to read it I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling with getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making a more challenging for members of the cabinet and do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that uh the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that our allies partners and friends\nAre concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a ... a good example would be NATO\nDuring the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it uh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not\nA particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated\nThe allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing in erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do as well in our position in the world\nAnd that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read his ... you know has Nikki Haley actually sort of provided a model or we were talking about this earlier in the show\nHow to both serve the president a and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it in my mind the president\nAbsolutely correct and uh the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will take a look at\nNikki Haley's performance and say uh you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from

adoption uh and and her search for her identity and what difference it made her when she actually sought out the truth of the story of her biological family were one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for\nTwo three talk uh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decide to\nUh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life [noise] um but but there's just freaking out the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt a lot okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think\nPart of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of the of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race I mean thinking about\nThis from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just things I Wish I had in my tool kit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wished they had\nThen offered more in the way it information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with them about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family um that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know\nI'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them the there's some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nTalk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to to to have those conversations I think okay now\nSo I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those racist experiences that you talked about uh was was something that is difficult enough to handle 'em or no one knew what to do with or how to come through that\nBut in addition to that ... was there was there all along and that you had um it just sort of internally\nWith racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an emptiness or something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features are complex and as you saw with your parents [noise] yeah I think it was it wasn't\nAn empty necessarily I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have that pointed out to me it did really feel the difference is strongly\nUm I in a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only like ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable\nUm I don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships and great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt that I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like very whites\nI grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family that was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this as guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what may have mainly decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced\nThat I Would have eventually search no matter what you know it's not something I have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered um I had gotten a little bit of information um that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birds [noise]\nUm and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... knowing my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have a good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and it can only those questions really become far more acute when there are so many on answered\nA issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them here to be able to share their stories we can you hang on for a second while it willy welcome silver color doesn't have slightly let's go to Jim who's calling from El Eldridge Pennsylvania Jim you're on the air\nYour fellow outside for taking my call um I just thought it was story of my ah I'm white\nI'm my first wife and I we adopted two children of color um one when he was six weeks old and the other or when he was two years old um and there was a year a difference between them so um my my story starts when they were like four years old and three years old and um\nThey're all grown up now other twenty or Twenty one but a a one day we're walking through the Walmart parking lot yeah just me and them and I've got one by any chance and uh I don't know how to do where the younger one jak he says no I'm Sorry the woman\nThe younger one jak he says\nNo I'm Sorry the [laughter] I'm a little nervous I'm On the radio that's already on our one Isaac the only way I think he was about four years old he says he said that he says\nWhy are you white and were black and you know right then it's like oh goodness I didn't think I'd have to have this conversation in a Walmart parking lot you know mhm I'm so I'm\n... I don't well he started oh isn't it I go to answer him and my younger son jak who is lighter skin um he stops he stops right away three years old he stops he rips his hand out of my hand\nAnd he says I'm not black and white huh and so now I turn to him because oh my goodness I I hadn't thought about how they view themselves you know yeah and you're a you know the younger one he was a a a mixture of a you know African American and Hispanic\nAnd he was just lighter skin and an Isaac was a African American and and Caucasian I was a little bit darker skin right and\n[noise]\n[noise] support for on point comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and constant contact with hundreds of customize rubble email template for small businesses to reach customers where they are every day there inbox learn more in constant contact dot com\nAnd college fine we're consulting work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com [noise]\n\nThis was on point I'm making a Chuck ... we're speaking this hour with Nicole Chong her new memoir is all you can ever knows her story of her transracial adoption and joining us as well as Joyce McGuire pave oh she is the founder of the center for family connections a nonprofit that serves children and blended families\nFor more than Thirty years a note Nicole just I Wonder if you could just\nBriefly tell us what happened when you finally we're reconnected with your with your biological family because I imagined that\nGrowing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know it was at that but that I deal wasn't wasn't fully realized I mean it's always\nDanger idealized and people you've never met 'em you know a lot of ways it it really was sort of a confirmation of the story I'd gotten as a child but much deeper and richer and more complicated hum and it was interesting you know I\nI hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective in what it must have been like like what factors could have led to the adoption that was something\nI guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them maybe emotional maturity or knowledge of the world to really consider what they might have gone through I was not expecting to find\nYou know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adopted and you know things that are just difficult that they were dealing with um that you know ... might have been factors in the adoption certainly but weren't like directly caused by it for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them um I did Sylvia a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed and then at the time I searched had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identifying information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer um but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd I'm so there's like two different reunions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one and like not easily I had always pictured like talking with and meeting them or reconnecting with him at least like together\nSo that was I was interested I was my first sort of surprised um and what I found initially or was that they hadn't never told my sister my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed and they'd never been told about the adoption they'd been holding died at birth\nAnd All right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier or just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a whole it was a whole family is sort of reconnection about as I mentioned segmented into like different different branch um that was\nSegment that into like different different branch um that was it was unexpected\n[laughter] well I mean so Joyce\nAdoptions are so complicated right 'cause you're dealing with the lives of the lives of so many people at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that that her biological parents hadn't even told there are other children I mean how how do you would\n... I don't know how is that unusual not really\nIsn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment\nBirth parents get the least and they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so at this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there's so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every story is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of your sisters did you know ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family did it get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go to I think that\nPrimary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched for just simply kind of cats and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about [noise]\nUm I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know unquestioned I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is one of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister's especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information\nUm you know she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel and I I wasn't really part of the family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please thought a medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that\nSo but Cindy Cindy with this with her family family the only ones you've got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps and\nKnowledge well this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call\nUm I was raised in the south or in the sixties or seventies Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a ... and my question is is I don't have any experience out or or or my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience\nIn a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experienced racism John\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class life ah went in the military where there's very little racism and you know I'm just not face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he no story dark he's you know going to face saying I don't know what to tell it\nJoys do you have an answer for John well I you know there are a huge question by one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American\nUm you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him and then you look for help for you ah you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah could've dino who's calling from Glen falls New York dinner you're on the air\nHi um I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughter the Asian American now uh we began our adoption process about Twenty years ago and\nI feel really grateful that we had the agency we did I had I had no knowledge of how to do

people of color are adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many cases were not so good mhm and made clear to us how important it was for one thing\nI'm not you know to the extent
