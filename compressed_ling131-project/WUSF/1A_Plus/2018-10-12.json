change as commissioned by the United nations uh which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage during an interview with on point on Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative and\nThat we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe've seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of food extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or haven't if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... how is the government responding to this a panel just this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives them much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change\nOr we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and a ... and has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president\nPulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states in agreement that basically all of the countries in the world I agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as effects putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken\nFrom scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet or\nI'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think the I think the biggest driver of climate changes denial but people in their everyday lives to turn away from it\nThere's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claimed to say that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because\nIt ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a bomb or a Lexus I'm asked totally what a action has been taken a a ... at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I Want an element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and a ... the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we\nDiscovered right away and as totally that said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if this report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas the issues at stake are quite dire need this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of the new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine\nA Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing and that is he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nAh and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of\nThe Supreme Court team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open mind\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you uh feel assured that listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind well\nHe had to say that to me based on who is a\nLittle ... in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because you know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the G O P\nCause you know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the ground oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist in a recent paper\nSo either we will go to negative admissions now basically or we will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pulled the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhere does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care when they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from the cost of the party the costs are keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil to civilization will crisis\nElect system ending or is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that are that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabin are what they does it now look as though there'll be a little bit used by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these races very carefully they're suggesting I'm thinking of Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to the polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling a hat or doing better than they thought they might in\nA state that they would normally be thought out to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is ear to say that that little bumpy thinks it's coming from what happened with cabin on fact\nAs you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect\nEven though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election I'm at and a democratic not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated

White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where are the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHands match during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their opponents being ... where's this rhetoric coming from [noise]\nWell yeah and you know let's just go to the ... called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the October night gates to thousands sixteen debate the president was at an event candidate Trump was asked will you will by by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know you have we reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed loose\nThe sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is it lose my head was writing in the Financial Times it's no leap to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that's that's a along step\nFrom where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president ... off speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped with a talking point and pollsters were suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party here and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans had been very concerned that their base is not as mobilized or excited about turning out in the mid term election and Democrats may\nBe so like I don't want to just stop you there to help underscore your point a during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend ... valley resident Dorothy me clothes told our co host making a chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nBut Democrats ... so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the ... [noise]\nHe would sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with Philippe ads on their heads and science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from one point said field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about how congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point reader dot org but Alexis to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of a mob than simply the people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly is a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our\n... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line that of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself as very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nA often inside of a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to draw sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd it is running as a socialist that there were lots of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party about while we can really use this because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left\nAnd you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nInteresting because there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen it in parallel but some kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats or an you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly to fight for a you know political success or earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration\nEarlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams a reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later when\nI say you know we don't do anything in for Neal do anything illegal but we're going to be tough enough to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when a young you know all those little game to be taken way\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams or ... in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is a wildly inappropriate he for the clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in\nEnd but the president or took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the\nThe the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones in a an incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on and the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they are part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks it's if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line type tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies\nAnd there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country would seem more moderate Democrats win and some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialist and progressive when and other places and uh what's gonna happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling

David and his serve it\nTo remember that they vary from state to state we have ten different elements that can be achieved to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or a non driver id or the free Alabama voter id that we give any other valid state issue that the federal id\nAh student ID A passport a military ID A travel Addy\nOr we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we ... David look we've broken every record the history of the state for voter registration and voter participation in our elections and ... were doubly excited about that because not a single time\nHas anyone been denied access to the polls because they didn't have the proper credentials when they went to vote not one time\nLet me ask you one question that some folks who analyzed or what efforts in your state and other states particularly in South but not only just south of said uh they say two things one of which they say\nThat some of these rules ... even if framed for a new truly disproportionately affect voters of color citizens of color or how do you respond to that that those repercussions are those cravings\nThat they're entitled to their own opinion but to not entitled to their own facts uh-huh so what are the facts I've just share it with you about voter registration in photo lab the delivery of share them with you about voter participation where we had one point two million Alabamians go to the polls\nBut the but the ... talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless it's as we've all a test and there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote and these things when ... when the wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he's ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well\nSo I I wanted to build up with the last caller talked about the difficulty of that at least many Americans to register to vote\nAnd um the secretary Merrill is very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it shouldn't be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on ads in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices\nWe're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and that really works to expand voter registration and to do so much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary marrow\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill a windy or like you know\nWithout me say it but I Will see any way that we have\nLed the nation in the last three years and much and twenty three days and voter registration per capita nobody has been more than we've done nobody's been better than we did we don't get when football\nEthic is something that everybody needs to know I also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration what you're what you're talking about\nThere's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people now one of the questions that outrage whenever somebody introduces the concept to me is it do you believe that\nIf you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision an opt out provision would mean that if somebody says now I Do want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to\nKeep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whether it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell them is that what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very excited about this\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different\nAnd that the yield very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things aren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of off in system through the DMV right now\nStates have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates\nSky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out says to weed getting a caller suggesting their own thoughts on this list\nIt's a great an opt out says so we're getting callers you're suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call ... windy day of secretary Merrill says ... ... what would you think of potentially creating a\nHoliday whether it be a state holiday are you going to propose that perhaps the national level to um have an official day off for voting whether or not they'll be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience people vote when it's important to and if you\nSay well if we had voting on Saturday of what had voting on a day that were specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well we've broken every record the history of the state and the last three major elections we've had the empirical data and they all said speaks for itself which is that\nPeople come when they want a vote\nWe as a secretary ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously the ... turnout eventually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik or ... you know there's obviously really interest to win one more and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race right\nOf ... and people really turned out but what would make you think that people are ... wouldn't it turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes place there\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go oh Seventy two percent of people that were registered voted\nIt sound like a guy you sound like a guide me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people can do it right well I like playing like that's your desire\nTo that that's what I said earlier we won't each and every eligible US citizen as a resident of Alabama to be registered to vote\nAnd to be able to participate and have a voter ID card and to be able to participate at the level they want to participate but I don't know why some people vote and some people don't if I knew that I'd write a book and I wouldn't be sectors date anymore I'd be a multimillionaire\nAnd I promise you that when you write that book while working on on point we'll have you on the second hour on friday will enjoy yourself very much I'd like to ... to to to weigh in here I just wanted to take secretary Merrill's\nObservation about when people want to vote 'em they they vote and you just\nTake that to be a a would logically implies\nRight if we think the only reason that people don't vote is because they're not interested in voting then what we're saying is that in the United states where we have turned out that's not even in the top thirty amongst democracies around the world\nIn

A. M. U. dot org before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want us to ...\nYeah I I just wanted to uh to mention you know poll Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to attacks uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money is at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument it's often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business California's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality\nBy twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I the IPC set forth\nA kind of crazy until you do it real and telephone is very serious about doing it\nAt the very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus 'em and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political will not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trying to\nImpose it a carbon tax across the country and he's running into a real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point not mine are kind of me I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose\nLive where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nThat as a base will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really tough and when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change and a sort of thirty to forty year our Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em their existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurviving ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to get people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that risking getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisers had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict it means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they start you migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those of you who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are on

signal please stay safe do not put your health risk for the sake of sending his voice mail but if you're able we love to know how you're doing eight five five\nTo three six one a one eh\nLet's move on to the White House where another major official is leaving the administration Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation on Tuesday\nA lot of people are gonna want to have a lot of recent time leaving and I want to make sure that it was a blessing to go into the language\nEvery day and defend in there [noise] um and I always I don't really have found from fighting for our country that I Will tell you that\nNikki Haley speaking on Tuesday about resigning as US ambassador to the un and others resignation was different\nFrom some of the others we've seen in this administration because it seemed to kind of come out of nowhere by surprise last month ambassador Haley published an op ed in the Washington Post declaring her loyalty to and respect for the president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation unannounced\nShane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation announcement do we take it at face value is there more play here what do you think well there's\nYeah there's always more apply particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think had found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state a sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations being UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position\nUm Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions I she she said they are and her meeting with Trump this week\nShe's not running and twenty twenty she plans will be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long the way a and so I think there's an element of that as well\nThe question of why now is a curious one that'll keep people in Washington guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms\nI'm there may be a Democrat certainly have Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation\nRelentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's been some investigation to that um it might have just a band that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior trumpet fish official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal\nUh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within an administration that many people feel needs them uh and she can leave with her head held high and I think uh certainly someone as smart and capable and as ambitious is Nikki Haley this is not her swan song\nYou know really that was exactly what was going to ask you about it's just kind of what you read into Nikki Haley's resignation compared to some of the other turnover\nIn the Trump Administration I mean it's not on the president's had former U.S ambassador to the UN to search for a year some serve for three or four years some search for one year or so\nThe sheer duration of her term isn't necessarily telling but the uh I I don't know that we view this in the same light as say the way that like Rex Tillerson left some of the other people in this\nRace has deliberately that's a great point I mean frankly two years seems like a natural timeline as for for somebody to serve in such a position and decide\nTo call it quits and down and Trevor Noah jokes you know hey at least is this resignation was scandal free and so there's that you know and it's been interesting watching a chorus of that\nAs Democrats and a democratic lawmakers praising her and then the last few days and saying in some cases that\nTicket for cancer ... non meat around just\nTo name our kids very nice today plenty of sunshine less humid and hide eighty seven degrees\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from love me in makers have go to meeting a collaboration meeting

news roundup was lowly demolished Shane Harris and Todd's will still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts on the week's top stories won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org cuts will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the oil I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation go\nSeems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now you're having an opposite effect on Senate races\nAnd house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging a Republican in a red state\nActually had a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat\nTo now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many ...\nAnd candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight had to cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fight to it at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward to and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was\nIn high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college\nUh I Would look to the house most likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this\nJoshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in this says supplemental background check will also and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up she's up for reelection\nYou think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily young who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd my thing I'll say it she just last night I'm trying to take the fight from you know on this ... thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real store and in front side the White House just put forth as three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on and she's very upset about that and Trump\nAre tempted maturation is really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics for the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping in the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Tony west he publicly just missed swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke him Tania west of the White House yesterday\nConnie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch we're going to do you want to say I don't want to put you in as far as I Love this guy here let me just this guy\nI Love this guy right\n\nNow calling us was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberal\nTo discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear of those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he admitted that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I\nI'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of easy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the regular desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other vices ... arguably more important stories I hesitated into the deep end this like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacle that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that is right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment than I Know for for for for me and my colleagues who just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest of MoviePass as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old and Mrs Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and Brett is and has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically said hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government has really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth\nWhat are we actually know right now if anything about what really happens All right well what we know right\nNow is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies are what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove Fletcher mark a shaggy who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility or the Americans and we understand have not seen the footage or hurt it themselves but there's a growing belief within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress in the White House or that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not\nAt all being forthcoming about that this is a politically difficult situation\nComing up about that this is a politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime and Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tampa", "day": "12"}
