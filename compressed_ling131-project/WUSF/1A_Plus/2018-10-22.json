Senate intelligence committee in March Tim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me the story briefly of the election system and software machine a model six fifty tabulate machine and I should note that election systems in software\nIs one of the country's largest vendors of voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nI've actually brought that up a little bit already but all all operate because there are some other details about yeah aren't trusting wanted so it's a bow type of machine that could be used at the ... or the county level too\nWhy it's so it's a bow tie billion machine that could be used at the at a county level to ah if it were ... were hacked and somebody could have it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands that's part one another part is that it was ... it was the one that was able to be broken and with a with a with a writing pen\nAnd third um it it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting vendors have taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them for kind of sticking their head in the hands on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting it to kind of go away\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that they that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence and so we\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any of the machines are no because we haven't done those friends the audits that you're talking about\nI I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being told on us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything needs to yeah there's a strong chance that it's that have happened and I'm just not aware of it in a few people are well\nEric Rosen buck at Kim points out that\nSome states use these this particular machine the model six fifty to process ballots for entire counties and you can imagine in closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as the White House's liaison or ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get fixed\nSo is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] those are really important point so to begin with this was not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of tries to process that election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clues and proprietary based on their bottom line interest of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security\nTo find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSystem here because the the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as ... as reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat er ES and asked election systems and soft or actually I Believe scent of a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary of copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nYeah it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the ...\nSecure yeah it's it's really disturbing for example Everytime I start something negative about the ... I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether\nOr don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced starts formation it reminds me a little bit of back in the olden days when the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things aren't aware that didn't allow new technology to emerge\nUm so I think there's a problem are now the streets or in a position where they're unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems aren't keep their security up today to do pattern\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this was more on the ... not being as transparent as Bush won\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to um point\nOh thank you uh first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election an election systems of software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with zero controls which is not the case in an election\nRegarding the M six fifty E. S. and as first manufactured it um in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that I just want to point out the ... six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner\nThat is not used at polling places but I I I think that I'll agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are kind of by computers and so those computers need special handling\nAnd in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present\nAnd so we can never get the ... down to zero\nLearn more about craft beer on Florida matters more search for it on your phone ... where I Do Google plane was pitcher\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where consulting work with high school students to identify and itchy their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more in college ... dot com\nAnd exact scientists offering colon guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information that cold the guard test dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making ... we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast a ballot you cast is as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard's bell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national in Texas the election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that indeed who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in uh how is it the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we we feel that will who thought shit we uh we actually started working on cyber security of our electrical systems by two thousand thirty\nA ... at that time we did it all blown risking vulnerability assess but um\nWe had any recommendations or a potent you eat in a low priority a little we've consistently work to get all those recommendations are that are being said that we also do\nA better place in the past and we continue to do a regular ... other patients house as well uh eh I think that the important thing to remember most\nOf for most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this decentralized system now mount on like most New England we do not have county government level to the state level or and\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back in the march or the or the Senate intelligence committee\nOr you know we announce at that time that we are implementing without growth on occasion yeah we've got Web Web applications are walls of the ...\nWhat will secretary it's actually kind of let me just jump in here your cell phone dogs also the shaky here but this is the key question when I ask you before hopefully your lovely line will fall apart but\nI'm seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken Marion Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible\nI mean NBC News is ... reports that in August in late August there were three different methods\nUsed to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya\nBut let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experience was scans our lives\nAre are a lot a lot of the systems showed us where they were coming originating from although the ... you can always count on that but the one that raised our attention if you want to call it um was one that said Russian Federation voted out onto\nA department of homeland security through the communications for the call that we have a developed over the last uh a year and a I think that that\nYou know our systems are getting paid thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it back in two thousand six being there were Twenty one state that were\nTargeted yep one state was breached\nAnd uncles the conversation was always about the state that was released would never about uh twenty eight that are actually a defended again\nWe stayed was reached you know I I haven't I haven't heard of that which they which was breached secretary condos\nThat was I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting one last question for you briefly 'cause I Want to turn back to I guess with the with what you have to say but but I mean you're the secretary of state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in election security\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I I must say it's a ... I Believe is that there are some practices that we need to put in place one\nOf them being older marked paper ballots 'cause that was really the only way that you can actually audit or we do what we call it legally hide statistical confidence level audits a randomly selected ... pounds after the within thirty days election\nUm we've been doing them since ... thousands never owned a discrepancy\nYeah well a gym condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYou're welcome\nMary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nI think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that early on this show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis machines or\nAnything like that there is a statistical sample on the ballot of the motor my paper ballots that you can check and make sure the sauce\nOf the ballots of the vote 'em are paper ballots that you can check and make sure the software\nI'm ... was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing a risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the H us to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications and networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes are running a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHigh make now\nI Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand several years ago we switch\nTo a new voting system instead of using the ... machine we switch to voter mark ballots\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning\nWe have locked suitcases for each district we have a\nStickers that keep the voting machine from being messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audits sheets how many ballots they have centralized become shrink wrapped in a package is the fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system or you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um\nOur in our elections bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gave a valid and have a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking these ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and amend that yeah they take the paper ballot\nThey get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through\nAt the end of the night\nWe have people who\nBreak down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to\nMemory card inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically handed to a runner\nWho physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits not official unofficial southern get it on ... ... ... and then um [noise] there is also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah will come down I'm going to take a I'm going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you you still a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guests reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call\nAn error grows and book um I think there were probably several other steps that you know the more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections are secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the rising\nThe take away at three o'clock this afternoon here on W.

getting a little to NPR eighth I Want to own a Lebanon it a little bit with a moment\nFrom ... drag race here it is [noise]\nMan made\nThat is ... making her exit from season ten in one of the ten thousand me mobile moments that come out of ... drag race or how much fun as it to make that show\nOh my goodness that is so fun you know we produce the heck out of the show we put everything together then we add drag queens to them and then [laughter]\nAbout how I already ensue but not only be about hilarity but the heart and the the courage it's so amazing and the stories that they tell a it ... it turns it it turns what we've produced into something of legend and of mythology and magic\nCan so about those stories I mean over the course of the ten seasons of drag racing for for folks who don't know actually I should let you explain for folks who don't know what the show is I mean but how would you describe will drag races\nWell it's a competition reality show where we are looking for America's next drug superstar and we put the\nCompetitors through a series of challenges\nThat are not unlike what my career has been I've done everything you could you name it in show business so the challenges are geared towards you know being a radio host or a TV producer a model or\nActing all those things and at the end the two competitors who are\nAt the bottom who get the least points after lip sync for their lives and uh they lip sync and or whoever does the best gets to stay and the one who doesn't have to leave the competition\nAnd you always remind them too don't bleep it up okay that's as close as I'm going to get to it on NPR here yes I mean it is the ... the show's combines\nObviously just the the visual spectacular ness spectacularly already making up words now a of the drag queens the the the challenges that you just talked about\nThe fun and the incredible hard road I'm surprised that more of the the queens just don't have a nervous breakdown on our own every episode but with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very\nIncredible things are about some of these drag queens say so sheer are those moments\nWhen they got me exercise because they thought I was ...\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because [noise] look straight now [noise]\nI just wanted to say about it but we're still friends but [noise]\nI've been living with ... with a lot of my life so much\n[noise]\nWatch it

Tom ... who are more jobs better more\n[noise] lovely [noise] can you didn't just getting better you got\nThe well the three drag queens you heard there were dusty me bought I'm Talking about ... having to undergo gay conversion therapy on giant on the very first season of drag race revealing she was HIV positive and the last one there Kim chi talking to her younger self\nUh about the challenges that she faced in and a rip off I remember correctly compete parents didn't even know that she was on the show that she was a drag queen or even if his she's gay right\nYeah right yeah you know the the the show challenges the contestants to\nFiguratively die and become reborn into their higher self and when I look back on my own life I realized that the worst things that happened to me ended up being the best things that happen to me because I got to understand what real strength\nIs and what my own strength is and I think the people watching her show uh they get that and they they understand that at the core of our show it's about the tenacity of the human spirit and how you\nAre an extension of the power that created the whole universe you couldn't access that power at any time but what you know when you're pressed\nIn those horrible situations that these kids named when your press that's when that power comes out to anybody out there listening to us right now understand that what you're going through a huge part of\nA your metamorphosis and and sometimes you don't want to and I say this even though in our country right now which seems so divided in so\nUgly but I have to believe that out of this metamorphosis just like a butterfly this violent metamorphosis\nBeauty will emerge and that's what we watch it on our show every season after season we see these kids who have gone through a lot and they they emerge as great beauties and heroes\nYou know and and the thing about the show is that there's that intimacy and the challenges but ... as you said earlier there's also fun at the drag queen drama and just straight up laugh and\nI really think we should give everyone a sense about how entertaining the show is so I Want to play a clip this is

Facebook for you people really want to know more about your early years in drag so Rob ... says please ask grew about his start in public access television in Atlanta\n[noise] well um I had been a working for my brother in law for many years in his car business he used to flip a European cars and also American cars but expensive cars and uh\nI had I done you know I'm drama school and I'm performing arts school and all that but I was sort of hovering in it and when I was about twenty I saw a TV show in Atlanta on public access so I wrote into the show and asked if I could be on and I what what attracted me to the show was\nA they felt like it was my tribe it was the tribe I had been looking for in fact it was the tribe that I had\nKnew existed because of watching public access ... from watching public television watching the Monty python's flying circus when I was about ten years old I knew that's my tried\nSo I'm ... years later I I saw public access in Atlanta and a man named Dick Richards who um answered my letter and said come on come on the on the show and\nIt was off to the races for men 'cause they indeed warm ... they weren't my tribe and Dick Richards are put out my first records on his label and uh he was a mentor to me that a a really kicked off my career and I I wouldn't be here without without him\n[laughter] specifically when you first started doing dragging me what was it that drag gave to you that you didn't have\nBefore well first of all I've always said you know you're born naked and the rest of the drug everyone in on this planet is doing drag so and

if that weren't enough already in March of two thousand Eighteen or ... became the first drag queen ever to be honored with the star on the Hollywood walk of fame\nAnd Jane Fonda presented him with the honor\nBut I'm really honored to be here I looked out and I say the star that's going to go into this walk of fame but I think it should be at least three sides is bigger\nThan any other star on the walk of fame because I don't think anyone else on the walk of fame has ever launched an industry group hall has behind the glamour\nBehind a drag queen\nIs a man of great doubt\nIntelligence

March of two thousand Eighteen now Republican Jane Fonda also writes the uh the introduction for your new book grew so so what's the connection to her\nWell you know I'm actually I'm I'm actually choked up hearing that a her say those things so lovely you know I I've always admired hurt in fact when\nWhen she showed up on the cover of life magazine in March of\nOf Nineteen sixty eight at our house I remember a emulating the pose on the cover of that life magazine cheese cheese on the cover as as Barbara and it was a pivotal point for me because I thought so much beauty so much strings\nAre and then I ... years\nTo probably to the day she gave me the star she presented me with the star in the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this planet I always feel like the boy you filled the earth\nA that was always my goal that's way dragon shapes shifting or wearing all these different hats\nSway drag shapes shifting or wearing all these different hats in show business has always been my goal and I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I just it on her show Grayson Frankie a\nAnd a with a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season of grace and Frank yeah\nWell you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be talking to you are today and we got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't want to answer that [laughter] 'cause you don't lose it you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know we'll see okay see we got\nOkay how about this how about a ... okay how does this is a a pretty easy one how about this one day in church wants to know that he'd be interested to know what the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influence how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal is always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of\nThe people behind drag in and tell their stories because it's it's it's a very unique person\nAnd personality who's able to\nAh ah change themselves and and to\nDie voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who are different every year every season\nAnd it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag a in part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have a change in the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent and drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big questions that the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because ah in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is I'm a ... will never take hold because the ego will not accept\nThe idea of someone changing their identity\nWe're our whole culture is based on a density a consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is\nAnd drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and not so drag will never be mainstream uh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is\nUm we eat a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas\nUm I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people they gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind\nSo that speaks to us as a culture as ...\nSo that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a I ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we catch our show is the most diverse\nA a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think\nUh this past season without giving anything away well yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little team because they who we have on the show um [noise] uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much you have your token white folks with a wave so when I'm\nListening you know we we cast a show based on the criteria is what it's charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast was show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking this question but I just have to know ah 'cause I'm a huge ... fan and and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that\nThat that you you drop her from the show in that in that great lip sync between her and trixie Mattel\nAnd I think she was just what happened there well\nWe need a first of all you need in so Rob because share Angela is almost deals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of misfit Angie she did one episode and became an international stuff [laughter] so you do um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nUm there's been a lot of media coverage of republic drag race because it has become so popular has really uh elevated the careers\nYou know of the drag queen to appear on the show to super stardom level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago\nThat talked you know is there a risk in the dry and community a little bit between um the clean to get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nUh you know people in booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially have been on the show and perhaps not booking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV [noise]\nYeah well that's that is the nature of show business and you know I I've been doing this for a long time um I've been in fashion I've been out fashion\nW.

U. dot org glad to hear from some of you across the state of Florida about what you're looking for from the next governor\nLarry tweeted I Hope that when he wins mayor Gillum will remember the poorest counties in my former home of the northwest Florida panhandle\nThey may be the ... part of Florida but represents a real opportunity for a Democratic Party reaching out to the working class citizens of our state\nLarry that is a such an important point that I have to tell you having just helped to lead my community through her the impacts of hurricane Michael er we had Ninety percent of our power and knocked out thousands of treats come down roads that were blocked\nA within a week we had Ninety nine and a half percent of people with their power restored roads cleared\nAnd a sense of normalcy return to my community and the first thing we did was dispatch a our utility workers\nOr to the western panhandle just west of us are to begin that recovery effort for our neighbors are the Gulf Coast region will return we will return stronger than ever but the next governor will help to preside over that restoration\nUh when when we are hit with natural disasters we come together as Floridians ah whether or not that politically that that is a community that will be for me\nI'm In no consequence there Floridians and there are a part of a of our state they is often been\nForgotten whether forgotten coast would not be forgotten under a governor Gillum not only are we going to see that community restored we're also going to work with them to help to define in economic future for that region that again makes them the pride of the state of Florida\nWe add one more voice to our conversation let me follow up with you on that a little bit one of the conversations that constantly comes up whether it was after Hurricane Harvey last year after hurricane Michael this year Hurricane Florence earlier\nIs about the future of these coastal communities you know parts of Florida like Mexico beach in basically the whole Florida coastline all the way around the state or in areas that are very much at risk for rising water levels ... Gulf levels ocean levels\nAs climate change progress is and it becomes increasingly difficult matter as to whether or not people are allowed to live\nRight next to the shore I mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one\nI mean you saw the satellite or the the drone pictures of homes that were built up to the two thousand one building code and homes that weren't the whole world were standing an older weren't we're we're we're toothpicks basic that's right that as governor that that's got to be a tough decision kind of considering whether or not the state of Florida at a certain point\nHas to tell people we know you love the ocean we know you love the Gulf but it is not safe to live here\nYeah no it's it's such a fair point on and and and and and in fact speaking about building codes or we may have to revisit a building codes again and light of the fact that we're seeing stronger in and and more increased storms I'm particularly up the Gulf where the Gulf waters are so warm\nBut then if they are then if you tell people where they can't live that affects the property tax base that affects the economy I mean well less than\nRight now we have the insurer a last resort in this state have undercover homes I'm Better nice in luxurious and yes you know ocean front properties but private insurance companies are refusing to write policies there and so that puts the entire state at risk\nFor having to ensure a homes that are being built in areas that are increasingly becoming\nI'm a ... a threatened by rising sea levels so so what I Would say is that we are deserving of a real statewide conversation likely county by county around how idiot that we are going to be building more resilient communities\nThat in the face of sea level rise and climate change that it doesn't make sense and some of these areas that we allow for property to be built\nAnd to be built and frankly in an unresolved way when we know that they are going to be susceptible to being wiped out uh with the increase stormed a dance and with sea level rise I I Can't I Can't tell you that there's a panacea and I can't I Can't tell you in this moment what exact part of the state we would be having to\nBegin this conversation I think is going to be a statewide conversation and it's one that we're gonna have to lean into the county and local governments\nI Want to reiterate by the way we did invite the Republican candidate for Florida governor Rhonda senses to take part in this discussion or a feature discussion we have not yet heard back from his campaign but the invitation stands we were certainly loved to have him on the program\nWhich I had one more voice to the discussion now to the questioning now joining us from W ELL are in public radio in Miami is Luis Hernandez who's the host of its daily talk show son dial Luis welcome to want to a a Joshua thank you so much I appreciate it\nAnd mayor again thank you I appreciate the opportunity I Do want to note that ah thirty one of sixty seven counties in Florida have started early voting and the counties are most of the counties here in in VW well around listening area including Palm Beach brought in Miami Dade county's have begun early voting\nI'm Mr Mayor it looks as though Republicans are going to hold the Florida House and Senate\nSo how do you plan to get any of your ideas through if the opposing party is in control of the two chambers\nWell one ah Luis good to hear your voice again uh um it to 'em and well aware and thankful for your mind to have the early voting we actually have some of our supporters who overnight it\nLast night watching the debate and where the first in line to vote down in Miami for early voting but to your question one I Am not joined the conclusion that Republicans will hold the Senate\nUm I think they will likely be in position to to hold the house but I think Democrats will get some gains that being said we will have a divided government um um I Would say this I think we've got to look too aware of the areas where we might be able to find some cooperation\nI mentioned earlier that I thought criminal justice reform was one area where we might be able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to help or get a salvage solution that might lead to a saving money and modernizing or a system that is in desperate need\nAnd modernizing I'm a system that is in desperate need of update 'em and I will tell you I'm I'm willing and prepared to work with or what might be a speaker holy oh a lever I'm here and I spent some time together for two years ah making our way through 'em\nIn Aspen Institute fellowship where we got to know each other pretty well now I don't take that to mean that I'm going to convince them\nTo believe in everything I Believe or vice versa but I definitely think that we began from a place where we don't think of each other as you know our enemies if you will uh will sit there to do the bidding to do the job of of of the people of the state and it's my hope to find areas where we can work together may be able to afford about housing\nOr maybe on dealing with health care in some ways can I convinced them that it makes sense\nTo pull down that six billion dollars\nFor health care which is for the state of Florida one of the most exploding parts of our budget\nUm so I'm I'm not beyond working with the other party I also don't draw the conclusion that you have to be the same party in order to work together you probably recall that there were a number of sessions where governor Rick Scott couldn't get his budget through and he shared the same party\nWith the speaker of the house and with the with the Senate president so there there there may be some benefit in my opinion to negotiating into them negotiating with me and trying to ah find solutions I Know Floridians are tired of us getting nothing done they want their government to work for them and they're not interested in our part isn't\nYou know squabbles they want to make sure that we can produce\nAnd and you mentioned a couple of different things or want to I wanted to approach you on is the criminal justice issue been public about the fact that your family had run ins with the law on both Miami Dade County and when you went to Gainesville uh one of your brothers was arrested on drug trafficking charges you make criminal justice reform\nOne of the critical points of your campaign for governor yeah how did your family's experience with the law at a young age informs these proposals for updating the state's criminal justice system yeah I mean so first I mean\nI shape it a shape that a lot I think if if you recall from my opening video when I introduced myself I talked to a bit about\nYou know watching my mother you know two years well up in her face when uh you know the the cop would come by the house and say you know your son's in trouble again right um that that that's a difficult thing for any child to have to see and experience\nAnd I remember deciding at a very early age that I never want it to see that expression on my mom's face because of something that I did\nUm and so I Am the first of my seven siblings to graduate from high school and add to fit that seven kids in the first to graduate from college when my brother got home after doing his time um I watched him want to be a better father for his daughter and a better partner or to his girlfriend and then to his wife [noise]\nUm and he went and apply for a job to job to job and got told no after no after no\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool

to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about leadership it's understandable to want some clear guidance on how to be a leader a formula or a checklist but retired General Stanley McChrystal says that search may give you some convenient answers but the truth is much more complex\nHis new book explores the paradoxes of being a leader\nWho do you look to in your life as

radio quality audio file will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day [noise]\nBack now to our conversation with Louis Hernandez or do you all are in public radio in Tallahassee mayor ... Lewis I Know our time is short but let me let you get another question for the mayor\nDefinitely a mayor I did want to ask you about the issue of race because it's been a pervasive throughout this campaign uh but you already know this lord is one of the most diverse populations in the country or the latest census data says that sixteen percent of the population is black twenty five percent Hispanic or Latino how's your ...\nThe population is black twenty five percent Hispanic or Latino how's your campaign connecting with black and brown voters to get them galvanized to take part in this midterm election [noise]\nYeah I mean I think we are doing 'em all the right things to try to communicate across frankly all community um I've been in red areas blue areas purple area I was in ... I think Trump one button thirty points Flagler about that same much we've been to the villages\nUm but we are here you know I I Will be at the University of South Florida where I Am today I'm with students um uh just did a roundtable with a Puerto Rican leadership in Orlando hosted in Yvette\nI'm I'm buddy quest for getting them I'm a a a little while ago and was in Little Haiti and did a video because I couldn't make it down there a ...\nA which went really well so we're we're communicating across constituencies\nAnd just to give you an example of I think how it is impacting us is that in the primary election we saw a hundred and fifty thousand bow to turn out to vote who either one we're voting for the first time or two we had not voted in the previous three elections a hundred and fifty thousand\nOr the last two races for governor Democrats lost by less than Seventy thousand votes um\nIt's my plan to double that number in this general election of unlikely voters and many of those voters will be younger voters of color are more women are more poor voters and I think we're going to perform very very well but the reason why I'd been going to diverse parts of our state\nIs because we got to stop treating the race for governor edited the electoral college you don't win one area and lose another when one county and lose another the one who wins it the one who get one more vote\nAnd that one vote may come through from anywhere throughout the length and the breath of distasteful unprepared to go there will go in because we're going to get voted a reason to turn out and vote for something and not just against\nThere are so many things I Would love to ask you mayor Guillen so many great policy questions we've gotten from our listeners perhaps we'll have a chance to talk to you again but one more matter of policy I'd like to ask you about before we let you go and that has to do with a gun policy in the state of Florida ... to make two questions from two of our listeners by email Jim emailed\nMayor Gillum given that at least the house will be in Republican hands what can be done to reduce the impact of Florida's Stand your ground law it seems unlikely you would be able to repeal it\nAnd then Ryan emailed what do you plan to do to better enforce current gun control laws before trying to pass new legislation ...\nYeah well first I'm a I think we have to work hard I'm at their till the stand your ground it is an unnecessary law and the state of Florida we already have castle doctrine which allows for individual to protect themselves and their businesses against intruders I'm a onto their property right\nI'm Sorry I I I hate to interrupt I think we should probably be clear the difference between we're talking about just by way of contacts the castle doctrine you're referring to\nBasically is that kind of your home is your castle idea that says you have the right to use deadly force to defend yourself at home weren't worth stand your ground carries it farther and says you have the right to use deadly force and they feel ... anywhere you have a legal right to be just\nAnywhere yeah and again that's that's vigilante gives them a that's the wow wow west and the city streets of you're able to make a decision\nOr about whether or not you consider somebody to be a threat I'm Out of your own imagination or in the recesses of of of your own mind and I think that that is dangerous\nCastle doctrine already protect you and your home there's already common last self defense which means and places where you are in public square and you result to having to defend yourself with deadly force there's already case law on the books where you been able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it ...\nBeen able and you've seen cases where people are able to successfully argued the case that it made sense to be able to use deadly force but to not take that to a different extreme and to provide under the cover and the color of the law people being able to sniff out innocent life based based off of their perception of threat\nTo me it it is it is a stretch too far um as it relates to what we can do obviously on that I I Want to make the case and I want to use regular voice of the Floridians to make the case\nOr to outlaw makers around the absence of common sense when it comes to these kinds of laws and help them understand how families like mine in like others who are raising black\nChildren um and black and brown children feel particularly I'm a under siege by laws like these take the case of Trayvon Martin trace of Martin the case of murky smug locked in a and there are many others and quite frankly talk to prosecutors who are saying you are seeing\nA criminals on both sides who are using stand your ground\nAs a way to take out there you know they're they're gang enemies because they both have weapons so it has also been extended to giving cover for for legitimate illegal practices in our communities and prosecutors are left to do nothing about it because folks are able to clients Dame years as stand your ground as a fan of\nFans who Ryan's point before we let you go with regards to enforcing current gun laws before trying to pass new ones what would you say to Iran so I Would say one\nYes we must enforce a current laws but we also got to do things like ensure that if you want to carry the power of God at your waist but you ought to have a background check\nTo do things like a convicted or a domestic violence abuses should not get access to weapons where they can sniff out the lives of their loved ones closing the gun show loophole these are extreme these aren't radical I was too by the n._r._a. in Tallahassee because we refuse to repealing ordinance and our city was simply said you can't shoot guns in city parks\nYou can't shoot guns in parts for our kids play and our and our families picnic\nAnd that was considered to be too extreme we've lost the common sense of balance here we're not talking about in the front of the second amendment\nOr simply talking about how do we keep our kids safe in school how do we reduce the level of of ongoing everyday gun violence that pervades our neighborhoods and we got her it was some decency here and unfortunately the n._r._a. runs roughshod over the state of Florida right now we got to put some decency\nBack into it Andrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee, Florida running for governor as a Democrat mayor Gillum we really appreciate your making some extra time for so thanks very much thank you

A. M. U. dot org\nSyria there was one more thing I did want to ask you before\nWe had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners about their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in granted I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that union negotiations for us on a raft with salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent the higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers would choose\nTo near that negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nAnd I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything that lying and has done the one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders eating movements are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices and it's actually not\nThat difficult to fire a teacher but what unions has done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and part of the reason that so important is because\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and\nTeachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go Sarah I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state are really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike\nTo make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are I'm not that they did and I do believe that that is why the strike was says except for we could not have done what we did without the support in our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it out hey are just about health care it's not about that\nNot just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and\nI had seen within my own eyes legislators are pitted late putting the entrance to the outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate Jamaican time forest thanks very much thank you what's that a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but I also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts\nNon union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair or equitable enough\nUnions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland comment about non union members going it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um uh uh differences that you're talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question too I think is an expert on down on drugs out there and she's joining us was NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to want to say\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in in a very upscale district and I hope she makes it one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also contract I actually I Know union contracts I should also introduced Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nTo thank you for having me on\n... I was gives me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save views or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right [noise]\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling it depends on what the crime\nWe're not as stealing it depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes is for everyone and sometimes it's the floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good time to cook a context for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage me very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find him back what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country [noise] All right to work all Janice means is that a union can't get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect a collective bargaining in any other way\nUnions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not feel like the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector\nHave seniority built in or the only way to get a raise and by logging another your other job can I um am all the way to go ahead and finish off ... um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union workers if workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for you right\nUh the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not\nI don't know I hear you on that I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to to go shoot your contract he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right\nLearn more about craft beer on Florida matters more search for it on your phone pod cast that or I Do ... or send her\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from civility investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more at fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services L.

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have of whether we're doing what people want to use their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a similar wills to donate their cars to be you know cashed out to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you don't have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union be tempted on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nWhen they get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loans the or student organization fees\nThat when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share and that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case about forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case there Janice overturned\nExactly so but look Janice\nHe'll be the case there Janice overturned\nExactly so but look Janice\nThat Alito Sam Alito judge of that's been court\nHas wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was idiot logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it\nThat the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party used unions as their foot soldiers so let's defund unions that had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to to find out however that case it's done\nAnd what has happened since is that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was\nOr Scott which I think I just want to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms and laws by the day after the genocide is sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states\nIf we we if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside of school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a ... a chance to respond and then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth knowing that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus Ashby case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond\nWell hey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them are trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz\nUm in some cases in credibly confusing time periods on some cases only about a week also that\nUm states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings\nOr make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time forbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work day clerk clerk or what you mean by a captive audience meetings what what exactly are you referring to [noise]\nUm well recent legislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with ah with new employees so basically think a time share presentation on steroids were the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for them or a membership form in front of them say you have to you know here's why you really should sign up\nAnd there was no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country said no no no you're right\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit\nWhen you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and shares help navigating that often confusing process and that process that can make confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped", "show_name": "1A
