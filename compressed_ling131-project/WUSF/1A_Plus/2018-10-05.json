S. M. C. A. the new fare better deal he's been promising since the campaign\nWhat do you make of the decision by Jeff Bezos the richest man in America to ensure that all us Amazon employees are making minimum wage Fifteen dollars an hour we're wanting to a hundred and forty three to five five that is one eight hundred for two three talks you could also falls on the twitters and the facebooks it on point radio\nI'm Talking with Jackie percentage of the Daily Beast on point news analyst Jack Beatty and here in Studio with Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post\nCatherine let's take a moment and turn to Trump's taxes that was a bit he must of the story was the New York city times uh you know taking a look at not just taxes but really the finances of the president what did we learn from that and why do you think it matters\nA I think we are all shocked shocked to learn that Donald Trump map to major fortunate and not by the flood of his brow but you know the old fashioned way inheriting the money from his father and then treating the IRS I Know it's it's a huge shock to all of us\nWell you say that but he sold a ton of books she said a lot of TV shows and whatever yeah he always resented the missing built this thing on the idea that he's a self made guy\nHere he is absolutely not he inherited I think something like four hundred million dollars from his father in today's dollars uh if you had put that into the S. and P. five hundred you know he would have already been a billionaire without having to do anything on a lake of work he\nIs an incredible south self promoter I Will give him that that is absolutely true but if you look at the contents of this monster extra day you see that again and again this guy who supposedly has a Midas touch 'em\nYou know and make made a huge business errors and had to be bailed out by his daddy this happened repeatedly this happened with his casinos and it's happened with other businesses so this idea\nThat he has some sort of um you know special insight into how to run a business or or how to cut a deal I Believe he is charming I Believe and you know and and I I Believe he is probably an effective dealmaker and the sense that he can bully people into getting what he wants but the idea that he has self maintenance just bogus\nJust bogus well let's play a little bit of a what his press secretary Sarah Sanders had to say during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday a you know the report had accused the president of questionable tax schemes and as you say Dodgers throughout stirs what she had to say\nSo totally false attacks based on an old recycled news story I'm not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring fourteen thousand words the story of the only thing I Will say one thing the article did get rides but they showed that the president's father actually had\nA great deal of confidence in him in fact the president brought his father into a lot of deals they made a lot of money together so much so that his father went on to say that everything he touched turns to gold\nEverything he touches turns to gold ... when you read that story if it can find things that you already believe a or not or what Newt you take from from having read that that peace will trust a dimension\nFrom having read that that is well\nJust the dimension of his um bogus self presentation you\nKnow he was a he was a gilded diaper deal to die for your red diaper babies there was a gilded started her baby and you know that one phrase that sticks out as self made sham or just the degree of this and then with the point the Catherine made\nA leaving our questions of legalities which seemed to be there and outright fraud which there's some evidence of\nIt's just the the his his upward failures you know you were just keep failing and ... ... plaza hotel botched Trump airlines bought casinos fail or in other words displaying in finance and business the bad judgment about economic matters that we see is president\nAnd a and an end and David Farenthold\nWho's really got the franchise on his taxes and so low points out that just when daddy's on you know contributions were fading out two thousand three two thousand for income the Russian oligarchs to fill the vacuum\nOf daddy and and you know the the two people you'll never say anything against her daddy and ...\nAh Jackie can sense when you think about this story uh one of those things that strikes me is that part of my fascination is is that the president didn't release his tax returns has been done nominees both presidential parties for the last I think forty years\nUh what repercussions if any other likely to be on the hill from what we've learned at least is this significant glimpse behind the curtains\nWell yes and you're one of the biggest takeaway from the story and it says on this point has been made but it just gives us the best picture of Donald Trump's financial situation I'm In the past that we've had yet we don't have anything recent now speaking of recent it really a lot of this depends on who wins the terms\nBecause Democrats say both I'm Richard Neal and Senator Ron Wyden they will be the top of their respective committees and the house and Senate that could request his tax returns and both of them came out right away and said that's what we're going to do we're going to get him ready to go if the Democrats take over if they try and now they're going to be told though right\nLet's turn now to something that Trump's uh uh the president gets to Harold as big good news uh he's just a his administration has just been able to strike\nOr a new version of NAFTA or as he puts it to a brand new deal a with our neighbors to the north of Canada are neighbors the south in Mexico for this trade deal a on Monday Trump addressed how's rocky relationship with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau might've affected his ability to complete the deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada\nWe had very strong tensions that it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to brand new do not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal\nJustin Trudeau had his own thoughts during his press conference a speaking about the trade pact and hear all the deals victory for all three countries as things North American trade would be in a much more stable place\nThat would have to preserve the fundamental principle of the original agreement which is that when you're trading partners ten times your size flu need rules you need a level playing field\nCatherine Rampell is this a brand new deal you know so why not\n[laughter] there's some stuff in there that is slightly more protection as there is some stuff in there that it's slightly more trade liberalizing that for the most part this deal looks a lot like the whole deal in fact it's kind of two deals to trade deals that Trump had previously called the worst trade deal ever\nSo much together that ends NAFTA and\nHe called the worst trade deal ever smashed together that is NAFTA and the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP which Obama had negotiated with eleven other countries and Trump immediately pulled us out of as soon as he became president but yeah I mean it's funny we spent basically the last year and a half\nAlienating our friends and allies punishing farmers and manufacturers with rounds of tariffs and counter terrorists and busting apart this a hard fought alliance that we had to try to alienate China and ended up basically in the same place we what has been had we not done any of those things and just\nProceeded with TPP and more amicably dealt with Canada and Mexico who were by the way quite willing to to update NAFTA or they themselves had said many times are both as part of the TPP negotiations and otherwise\nThat NAFTA was old and needed some modernization you know it didn't it didn't include like e commerce and a bunch of things that didn't exist in the early nineties so we're basically where we would have been um had Trump not wrought all of this damage and destruction\nSo I don't exactly know what the pay office I'm given that we had this long term damage to our relationships with our allies suit\nI mean there have been some praise from even some liberal consumer groups were concerned reunion I think proves there's there's some other folks who say there are some things here that are good environmental when we were that was all in TPP so this is all you're saying that that there were they may have been some benefits this but the way you see it as though that the costs in a relationship\nWith our trading partners is actually the real harm here\nYes I think we wouldn't we did not need to um alienate all of these friends and allies who we needed to deal with other major trade problems I eat China um which again TPP was designed to try to contain\nA ... you know we we've basically\nUm I think permanently frayed or at least ... cause long term scarring\nTo our relationships with these other countries and has very little to show for it because the things that most of the things that have been praised by labor groups by environmental groups and others were again in a deal that Trump ripped up last year ... and I think what just started ... ... yeah just interject\nHere I mean that's right um but I think this is just it it goes back to being about the president and being about three brand and being about him being able to go on the campaign trail and say promises made promises kept and I can't stress\nGod

the news with Jackie could send it to the Daily Beast Catherine Rampell the Washington Post and on point news analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories or on your radar this week we're at one hundred and four to three eight to five five\nThat's one eight hundred for two three talk can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI think one of the interesting questions or that we have is how all these things play out one of the midterms going to look like they're just a few weeks away Jackie could send it to you talk to people on the hill what what forces did they say you're going to be shaping the selection well\nIt's been really interesting to last a day or two on you started to hear some nervousness from Democrats on the hill and elsewhere about how this Cavanaugh a confirmation was playing out initially because of all the allegations that were coming forward I'm from I women in his past\nThere is a thought that a vote for Kavanaugh would cause a backlash among women I'm with a Republicans that said as the as this has gone on and that so much more it's come out there is a feeling I'm within Republicans and I don't care where what part of the party are talking about at this point\nThat he's been under attack that this has been unfair and started to shift against and it started to your ear starting deceived talking to Republicans in their internal polling you're starting to see the Republican base wake up\nAnd really get back at getting engaged and to get involved which is exactly what Democrats do not want so yesterday you were hearing from Democrats okay let's just get this over with so we can go on and start you know go back on the campaign trail and refocus\nOf people on other issues now will that momentum from the cabinet vote should he be confirmed today we do not know that that are I'm Sorry tomorrow um we didn't know that yet but ... but if if he is confirmed will the anger on the right to be able to sustain itself for five weeks\nI have a hard time believing that just because of how fast the news cycle tends to go ...\nYou know we talked about the legacy of Anita Hill Clarence Thomas in his uh here and she of course has been on that\nThe legacy of Anita Hill Clarence Thomas in his uh sharing she of course has been on the bench ever since uh is it your sense that things have changed in any way as a result of these hearings in terms of the conversation about uh about allegations of sexual assault and the way in which they're handled\nI think before the hearings I Would have said that yes we take these kinds of accusations much more seriously today in the wake of me too and the way have greater awareness of the prevalence of um problems like sexual harassment and sexual assault\nYou mean as a result of hardy once I hardly yeah Roger ales and Oh yes so many a major figures who has been accused of a various kinds of a sexual misconduct and have had a fall from grace as a result\nUh and I would add plenty of other you know Bill Cosby amongst others you know people who are like ... figures are very powerful figure now ...\nYes exactly um who have been punished to some extent for their behavior\nThat said the way that these hearings 'em and accusations related to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have shaped up um suggests somewhat of a different lesson which is that it's not so much that I'm\nA people on the left has become more fired up they were already fired up about issues related to meet you in sexual misconduct instead you have people on the right more fired up if you had asked me a month ago whether I thought that having a Supreme Court nominee at a Trump nominated a Supreme Court pick\nA credibly accused of sexual assault whether that would be good for Republicans\nI Would have said no but that is clearly not the lesson that we have seen we had seen that the the right as Jackie mentioned has become much more energized by this fight the left with already energized a again before all of this happened on these kinds of issues but now the right is and if you look at the enthusiasm gap\nBetween Democrats and Republicans going into the midterms it has greatly narrow it I think that the whole fight has in fact I've been good for Republicans ironically\nJak where did you see this do you see this end up playing playing out in the election or do you think that it's more likely when what we were talking about earlier about the economy\n[noise] I I I don't know I suggest he probably was right about the dynamics that you know the Republicans going to have left to be indignant about the ... of the nation now will pass to the Democrats\nUh uh but uh but to get back to this you know the the the the the whole accusations against judge Kavanaugh you know we saw in two thousand sixteen the character didn't matter to Republicans a group of political scientist who studies the president's paddle\nA couple of hundred of them\nUh last year said that the president was already the worst president as an American history where we can't do that but he's certainly among the most of the worst characters who've been president who's lying all the stuff with the women and so on but that doesn't matter to Republicans now do you mean we can voters or demean folks in the party checked\nI I I mean I mean I'm In Republican voters they essentially made that ... that is what Hillary Clinton's campaign was all about he's a bad man look what he's going to do you can't have what were you told your daughters about him is none of that mattered a and it it was ... it doesn't matter either\nGetting some response from people on line of listeners who are saying uh uh one Sandra asks do Republicans not remember ah the sudden majority leader Mitch McConnell stalled the nomination of Merrick Garland for ten months where was there outrage about process than sounds of crickets chirping\nAnother says that shouldn't have chicken let us that this has gone a lot of long enough uh says how'd you get home I don't remember sort of echoing a the characterization of President Trump against a doctor a blog Ford and Chicken Little ultimately a a summarizes single person in his family destroyed\nA little ultimately a a summarizes single person in his family destroyed by the Democratic radicals for\nNo particular reason ... can you set up the map I mean obviously the Senate is a tougher uh he'll decline for the Democrats but where is it looking likely the Democrats can't achieve some gains if if they are to be to achieve their hope both for taking over the house\n[laughter] oh wow I'm All right so um I Do not have my map in front of me right now\nI'm ... you know what what if you think of a couple of key key races ones come to mind [noise]\nUm you know there are ... when you talk to the party chairs um wage I have they talk about other Republicans talk about um several states in ah Minnesota that they thought our\nOur bellwether as there are two open seats there are two seats that have current members and I'm I'm pulse and and Louis\nUh those seats are seats there watching to see how how the tide turns um I think any district where he and I think Texas is going to be very interesting not necessarily because of the Senate race there but because of you're seeing record a voter registration in Texas\nAnd you're seeing in the house seats where perhaps the turn out that a better O'Rourke\nIs um generating\nMight end up toppling some of these Republicans who have been there for quite a while and we have to wait and see you again a month as a lifetime right now\nI'm In a in this cycle but I you know anywhere where I'm Hillary Clinton won in a Republican seat keep an eye on those seats or anywhere where you have um you know suburban women\nAre going we're all going to be watching them and what they do\nAnd the next ... a month or so who they're siding with independents I'm really uh it it's going to be fascinating I'm asked to you know where where we see 'em movement but certainly um suburban districts as well\n... you know a lot of uh you saw a number of Republican retirements in districts uh and I think in the federal level as well where lawmakers had discomfort with Trump or were being a opposed by sort of pro Trump figures within the party primaries ah what's ah\n[noise] ah what are you seeing the general elections how closely are Republicans time themselves to the White House or districts as themselves from it\nI think it depends on where you are um but all you need to do a Jeff Flake said this week I think and they all blend together so forgive me if it was friday of last\nBut this week Jeff Flake said that he couldn't have done what he did in that committee um with with Kavanaugh had he been running for reelection\nSo there really is um is there really is a thought and particularly in places like Arizona um where they wrote public and don't feel like they can completely separate themselves from the president then\nFlorida has been extremely interesting I'm Rick Scott who was one of the president's most out their supporters has taken a step back\nFrom the president you have a house I'm I'm In a house member there are someone running for a house seat who decided not he doesn't want to come to a rally with the the president because he doesn't want to be closely tied to him so I really do think it depends on where you're running whether you're hugging the president tightly\n... are are you seeing a you know much has been made as was made Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas nomination the idea to severe the women were going to see a huge surge you're hearing a lot of talk about that if there is some sense of that will actually a a yield

LA Kemper Emmy nominated started the Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right there you heard the show's theme song A L e a\nK Schmidt it was as you say in your book and rightly so it is freezing pitch of a series or just you know the two sentences tell us the set up a ... of what can be Schmidt is and how she writes in her ... ... ... ... you know where she is when she arrives at our donors it's\nInsane so she said the backstory of ... is that she was kidnapped when she was fourteen years old\nI'm held underground in a bunker for Fifteen Years and then rescued by the FBI or where she is a brought back into the world and decides to make a new start for herself and of course New York city that's\nWe start so I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it it um I certainly thought when I heard the idea for the show that someone\nSomewhere with ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the set up for an extremely tough tough drama that's you know you could imagine HBO tree you know the guys who did the wire doing this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet it at a rubber car like and made it into a an extremely funny show\n[laughter] so tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the sets did your outfits like everything is incredibly brave almost passed outright and you could not be ... you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as a ... in character yeah but you could not be basically a more default sunny reactor\nI Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girlish she wears bright pink pastel pants much to my like LA's chagrin because I don't I don't like us\nBut we're in ... I think that she was floral shirt she wears jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and at at the same time she is this fierce\nTenacious warrior who has been through something to think of all and\nI'm so difficult that I Can't actually imagine what that must have been like and yet she continues\nTo choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that\nSort of tenacity up or or if you have a force to develop it during you know at a test\nLike the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah uh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt a roommate and friend Titus a tries to give her a goodbye hug on the first day of school\nAnd best of your tires are uneducated adults\nOut some day when you're a black man you have a candidate you see like this [noise]\nActually\nTruly truly funny a and you know in Deering and loving at the same time there's an undercurrent oblique it in all this stuff how do you have you look at this rather dark comedy with such ...\nI ... I don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject and as a very serious as the one\nUm that can eat the the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because of bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it is in the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's ... it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know a ... fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so that it was that I went abroad and so I'm like well it reflects life but it does\nWell so you just obsolete show created by Tina Fey moved on initially for NBC and leave it was a ... a Robert Greenwald who's the head of entertainment I guess he was like this was great I Love it I Love your team wonderful what field is to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were qualms about that so I\nI Do and I I thankfully don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again it you know I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus is sending her off to school because she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up until ... twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed that because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't do that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I Wish I could have gotten on Instagram before you honestly honestly where she's [laughter] I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think the Cheech is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been hurt her adolescence was stunted it's Arrested Development and she's coming out\nUm as a [noise] twenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life and it would not be done I think you are but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\nI I wouldn't say that you had on address but you certainly come into contact with a lot of issues that people are are working through in thinking about\nA there are a couple of

correspondent David Folkenflik we are talking with comedian an Emmy nominated actor Eli temper about her new memoir my squirrel days we're going to be talking coming minutes about her presence and amid a crop of really strong women in comedy names that come to mind among others Tina Fey in polar maybe killing\nA camper started the Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is with me in the studio thanks for being with us again thank you for having\nMe so I just want to pick up on something that we were talking about uh uh during the break a which is where's the line you guys joke about me to you guys make clear her feminine or you know can be Schmitz feminist higher you know and also yet you have\nHer be sort of the comedians do fish are almost backing into being a complete sexual harassed or the workplace um\nHow do you joke about something that's so serious\nI don't have the answer and I and the ... been struggling with that in and sort of wondering about that every day because it does seem like so much is changing in comedy and I'm ... you would never want to reveal eyes are a little anyone's concerned and so I don't know\nI don't know where is the line between making a joke and making a at an observation and so\nOn I think it's it on it's a it's an enlightening time and it's a powerful time because it leaves are feeling at a comfortable and secure in coming forward and and ... of revealing what has happened to them and there's nothing more powerful than owning a truth like that and\nI I don't know if you know it's it's jokes that I think you could've made\nYear ago or two years ago art are no longer funny and so trying to figure that out is that a good or bad for you I I mean I like a lot of my humor does not go into like you know\nUm that that kind of materials so I I I'm a by that I mean like I'm not known for like my a fence it bold comedy but I think that it is when writing the book I was I was very my editor and I were very concerned with how\nOn something might come across ... again it wasn't writing a lot about like um [noise]\nUh uh subjects that were enormously sensitive but at the same time something that you might just think oh Im just rattling off a little joke it might not be\nSo free agent when is it like Michael Jordan who's like look I don't get involved political stuff because Republicans up by sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from from that stuff to thing\nVery your eye on them little logo [laughter]\nThank you for recognizing natural and second yeah I mean it it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't mean you have you can't not be political now it's too crazy and\nA momentous a time so I think you can't just say oh I'm not going to get involved but I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with him so I I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because\nThere are out in some ways like the last question on this I Want to ask is you know do you think that can be Schmidt ultimately in the way they handled this in addition to getting left in addition to making sure the humor was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we're here to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to make I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to make these points\nUm both political and some of his points while also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I ... I Would no I I think it's too crazy time to avoid that\nWe played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... ... uh apparently you said you shared a questions about women and comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch weight ... ... talk to somebody at fourteen you took on the question that you said that he'd been out not just by ... by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes some women are funny aren't funny I it's it's similar to have some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you know selling them in our short\nTo ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different\n[laughter] they are\nApparently the women are different from one another's what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think\nI Know women are different from one ... in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from reporters standards yet you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully some of them less meat than others but\nI I think that is that when bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference of what happens but everyone decided like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay for our so\nWomen can be funny but I have to be honest I never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was\nBased on the box office excessive bridesmaids that that uh it demonstrated you studios that you can make\nA very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny it's so stupid because it what are you talking about\nYeah they've always been funny and he went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who knows the noted British an intentional controversial as they actually wrote this thing for Vanity Fair saying essentially obviously women are not funding\nWas he actually wrote this thing for vanity fair's essentially obviously women are not fun and they don't need to be a war that something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in in the two thousands would that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv I think and I said it did a less of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen it's from white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed that the movie was funny and I thought get out of my inbox because I don't know it's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised\nMe me furious because but I I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue if someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nTo turn their backs and congrats on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money [laughter] sometimes you were with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig\nOr or what did you what did you learn what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of I think public we tried to articulate how she tried to model things for women comedians would be like you know you got to be tough and you got to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working for\nThat what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Tina Fey or just by watching her because that women lead by example and she doesn't complain that she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly\nAnd she's very grounded so I think that there it's on\nShe empowers women by doing she just she she's she talks about it but she also just does it and so\nLike like like walk us through what that means a little bit for listeners who may not a folder as closely as you well\nI guess it means that it's not it's not like it's a constant thing like I mean she was I've read bossy pants Fifteen times I mean it's it's really selling her best selling book which is just\nBrilliant and she talks about this in her book being the boss and I there's so\nThere's something in her introduction where she says\nI'm that she gets asked a lot like what's it like being in charge of all those people and she compares it to she says\nOh it's like it must be like when people ask Donald Trump hey how's it feel to be in charge of this is before Donald Trump with President by the way and her point being that nobody is asking Donald Trump that although people should be asking that question but um it's because she's when people are now I think people are saying [laughter] it's every show different book\nJoined us but this American Life tomorrow starting at noon here on W.

share that and and she uh acknowledged that she didn't choose to share that it just came out\nThe president's behavior is something that makes many people around the president United States today extremely uncomfortable [noise]\nThey have at the beginning of this process we're trying to be respectful to say that a doctor for it needed to be heard and listen to or that there were important issues there and the president broke out of those constraints and we're sitting is I'm sure Susan Glasser and a Eugene or\nWill will comment as well in a very extraordinary moment\nWhere many Americans and their experiences at that have gone through with many others sexual assault victims in the past who have kept quiet and said this weight even Susan Collins who is now probably uh in in a position to vote 'em in in favor of a judge Kavanaugh\nHas has said you know people do not talk about this these are the the most under reported incidents and I would like to add just your genes comment about Kavanaugh's\nWall Street journal op ed that was written for one person that was written for not Donald Trump it was written for Senator Flake Senator Flake at the Atlantic idea at the Atlantic festival this this week said that we could not have the kind of temperament that Kavanaugh showed on the Supreme Court he says we cannot have that on the court we just cannot\nAnd he was referring specifically to cabinet going after senator after senator after senator after his very emotional opening statement\nAnd that was a message to give flake cover to also vote for Kavanaugh so we're sitting here where people are walking away\nFrom the allegations and uh the tunnel that many women and their partners and others supporting them feel about this being a shoved under the rug rats while others are getting out I'm essentially\nFig leafs and passes to be able to vote for cabinet\nYeah he did have a lot of very sharp exchanges with senator Amy ... and Patrick Leahy and and Dick Durbin and many of the Democrats who questioned him last Thursday fewer quick questions and then we'll we'll keep going let me get to some of your comments as well Virginia and in Washington DC writes democratic obstructionism\nMerrick Garland\nAnd Susan in Gainesville, Florida asked what on earth is the rationale for only one copy of the report a forty five pages being provided for review by one hundred senators\nSusan clearly a lot of things for voters to carry in they're not at all distant memories when they go to the polls in November go to the polls next month and you have any\nReal hard reliable sense is there any evidence of how much this may affect the mid term elections I mean a lot of what voters vote on in the midterms doesn't have to do with what happens in Washington ... does a lot of it has to do with what happens at home do we have a sense of what the balance is looking like right now\nWell look first of all it does depend in fact on how the ... and ah there is an interesting argument to be made that if Kavanaugh is confirmed\nThere is an interesting argument to be made that if Kavanaugh is\nConfirmed a it's much more likely in a way to somewhat fate as an issue for Republican voters while\nA becoming an enormous rallying cry for Democrats and conversely were he to go down\nA especially in such a spectacular fashion so close to the election there's already a sense and President Trump clearly feels is which is why he's been joining up his his voters over the last week on that he you know that work have not go down that this would outrage a and an enraged\nA Republican base voters in a way that could prove beneficial especially in some of these key Senate races are in ... which is already taking place largely on a favorable to Republicans playing field this fall what's unusual about this\nDevice if I had many divisive fights before a it strikes me that this is coming so close to a mid term election therefore injecting a volatile note of uncertainty with just weeks to go to the election number one number two a it is\nA cultural war being ignited arguably among Democrats and Republicans while\nBoth sides I I wrote last week about the two Americas that would listen to a the very jarring lead different accounts offered by Dr Ford and ... and uh would process this hearing it in a completely different way I think we've all watched that playing out over the last week a each a\nPolitical tried in our increasingly tribally divided culture has a whole different facts set a whole different narrative a whole different argument to make it inflaming\nPassions on both sides are Republicans have made a lot over pulled in recent days showing that\nA Republican voter enthusiasm which had been very low a very turned off in this midterm election year has sparked up words out over the last week you could argue well that's just that the election getting closer and we're not sure how much it has to do with cabinet but not my guess is that you know for different parts of the country\nOn this works entirely differently a politically\nLet me get one more comments on this and then we will keep going of course we'll keep an eye on at the vote should be happening imminent leaves shorter and all that goes but one more comments on this from Gary wrote on our Facebook page\nSexual assault aside Kavanaugh was not someone I saw as being even killed and being neutral making political statements during his opening yes he has qualifications on paper to be a justice however his temperament should be assessed\nLet's move on to some of the other big stories of being news this week including with immigration policy roughly three hundred thousand immigrants from El Salvador Haiti Nicaragua and Sudan have gotten a temporary reprieve\nAfter the Trump Administration threatened to revoke their temporary protected status or TPS this week a federal judge in California put the administration's plans on hold for now\nYou know you can always find something fun to do when you click on the bench tap at our website Wu ... dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from ... and from Boehner with Boehner's certified craftsmen program a

professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security healthcare and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Susan Glasser Eugene Scott and Steve Clemons let's talk a little bit more about that New York times investigation regarding President Trump's finances uh Eugene I think\nOne of the things that is worth knowing for sure was what Susan Glasser said regarding the uh the provenance of the information related to the investigation are there other big questions that are still out there when it comes to the president's tax history we still don't have his tax returns provided by him for example I was\nSay that's the biggest question I mean the reality is this what's done over\nA I Believe Eighteen months what has happened since uh you know the piece was published or perhaps the research and we still do not know are there more questions than answers because many of the answers could be provided if we actually had a the tax forms which\nSarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much gave us a reason to believe earlier this week we we perhaps should not expect uh the reality is that this is not an area that Trump\nI desire to be transparent about and many of his supporters don't demand that he has I think there are people who are have noticed how much wealthier he has gotten since getting and\nUm the White House and and regarding specific uh businesses have had\nAh some of the um hotels have been rented out by international organizations perhaps wanting to um curry good favor with the administration um and I think there's some people who are concerned about how that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\nHow that could influence a policy foreign policy specifically\nWell it's been four years since the fatal shooting of black teenager look climbed McDonald by officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago this week marks the end of that closely watched trial has been jury deliberate we're keeping an eye on the verdict come will keep you updated on any developments on that before we continue with surround up a quick word\nAbout next week the black lives matter movement which they will climbed McDonald cases definitely caught up in focus is on police shootings of African Americans and one of the most prominent voices in that movement will join us next week de ray ... cats in\nHis new memoir called on the other side of freedom appealed for police reform and remind supporters of black lives matter to keep fighting for awareness of this issue\nWe'd like to know what questions do you have about the black lives matter movement today or questions for directing a caisson he tried to turn his activism into elected office when he ran for mayor of Baltimore in twenty six team that beat was unsuccessful but what does it say about where the movement is and where should it go\nShare your questions for activists during the cast and you can leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nWhat do you want to know about the black lives matter movement\nEight five five to three six one a one eight you can also use our new app won a vox pop when you can leave us a radio quality message or check in on future topics you'll find one vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the app store and we will share our conversation with the ... coming up next week on one a\nWhile to vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are ... of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nThe next vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court we heard just a few minutes ago that Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine\nWho might be a potential swing vote on this announced\nThat she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical Taft voted this cloture vote\nTo end the debate we're just double checking our numbers right now I Want to make sure we have the exact right so total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of Susan ... I ... she is literally leaping out of ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one who voted no show Joe Manchin that Democrat from West Virginia had voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes he's in colon sits voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not to necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on cabinet because states afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision\nSo we don't know necessarily what this procedural vote to me but I think it's quite significant\nOr just the the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote if those positions were holed up in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe from senators who are struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote in the next one well you'll have debate on the floor\nOf it goes on and they'll bring that debate too close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm and which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh and that time it it\nVote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window hardly any time of day I mean one of the things about this at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have\nA senator from Montana uh uh the Danes whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk down the aisle so ushered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way of a system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell is obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nNoting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed\nWhether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been an exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible and not one of these votes that she viewed one of these what you have to do in person there is no app for that so certainly his [laughter]\nHis uh his other life commitments could have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines\nAbsolutely I think everything I just leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think ah there's a a ... a larger idea on that David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part us in the judicial branch has become um\nWe talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions in partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that I mean if I if I may Joshua\nOne other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother\nTweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a a a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the Kavanaugh nomination so the broader side in terms of the tectonics in the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate is\nIs also hedging on this that if mentioned were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it it very seriously could raise the stakes of him losing that states so there are different they're different issues here one is what what does the future prospects of\nA the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the Kavanaugh nomination itself and this lifetime appointment but\nMany people are looking at high campus now or in a much more endangered position um and this probably uh if if Manchin follow through with his position on on the vote tomorrow increases the chances that he will survive a in November Susan\nJust I mean I think that that's our view right now ah apple pie if Kavanaugh gets through and I think seems a tiny bit more likely after this culture of it than it did before because it seems to me that\nJoe Manchin seemed somewhat more likely to vote yes on that nomination than we might have known going into this cloture vote but if if it gets through in the end I think Josh made between early ...\n... gets through in the end I think Josh what made this point earlier in the pocket they may or may not actually prove decisive in any of these individual Senate races uh it's uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tampa", "day": "05"}
