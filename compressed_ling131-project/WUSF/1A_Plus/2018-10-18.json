T. L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price\nOf their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring costs down but there is significant debate about whether or not\nThat is indeed what would happen and we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us\nFrom washing today and we definitely want to hear from you were at one eight hundred for two three eighty five five it's eight hundred and four to three\nTalk uh Mike Lee ... there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask but I Need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand and Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television ads\nAnd ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increase government costs\nSo I'm going to presume that is pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what a day just to say that it can influence patients' choices [noise]\nSo if they if they advertising is that effective\nI just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nSo I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do is raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician I can say direct to consumer advertising the pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office\nBut in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks and Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness it doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one the the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important\nI think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals so that it's not just the list price that does not out of context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient\nAs well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make\nAs well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are I'm faced with situation stressful situation\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness cancer hepatitis are HIV ... we don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiated in fact there are some discounts that are written into law\nOn Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given um how would that be reflected in a TV ad would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law they're yeah they're the the VA has discounts there's\nDiscounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's you know other discount programs there was a three forty discount programs so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is very interesting [laughter] ah but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough\nWhat will work and if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see I think that overall it moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm that the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize\nThe variety of reasons that maybe they weren't brought up um and so while you may not like a specific advertisement\nUm overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines are there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illness like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses and maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second uh because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist and senior fellow at the health foundation project hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush also an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential\nCampaign get Lenski welcome to implant nice to be here with you it's great to have you\nAnd also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me ... you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America or I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising\nWill lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nNot a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that peace will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive drugs it must be nice\nWhere people think oh that's a really expensive dry it must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence the behavior\nAccording to what something costs the relevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time when a drug is being considered and then a relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or another drug that's really what's relevant to patients\nAnd because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and there's\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there are some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have a what's called a um a supplementary policy they'll the general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician about\nIt's important information because there is a lot of variability but it doesn't really help people to have\nInformation about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know we'll do that just information that's that can be helpful to\nDavid mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of senior high high numbers first start certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been said already that are putting the list prices on as it's not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country I also don't think that uh by forcing companies to put the list prices on that they will be shamed\nBecause the big drug companies in this country have shown that they're willing to be shamed all the way to the bank\nUm they continue to raise prices way beyond as you said at the top of the show a rate of inflation or health costs inflation these take a toll on patients like me I haven't a curable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time it given to me\nThe adventure begins Thursday evening at nine O W us up and do nine points of um\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from a guy called celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for a driver across America more information on auto insurance available and Tyco dot com horse one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd Charles River apparel making the new Englander rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever the day has in store the new fall collection is on view and Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point a magnet Chuck ... we're talking today about a Trump Administration proposal to require drug companies to disclose the list prices for their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs that farmer\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry he's also an emergency room physician David mitchell joins us he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs\nAnd get Wilensky is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the health foundation project hope and she's also former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position or in the administration of President George W. Bush\nNo Gilliland ski I Want to ask you want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous a segment\nAnd that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who really rely on Medicare and\nAgainst want to offer some some context you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned she Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceutical then\nIn twenty Fifteen fourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks are paying the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug costs Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars in Switzerland the only difference there being that we've got governments negotiate on and on behalf of patients in those other countries to why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually who doesn't\nI uh helped set through the Congress that's actually who does it a set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals ... it's a take or leave it here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not or as you choose\nUm there is true the federal government could set prices\nFor pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries\nThere's ... has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is\nFirst thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price uh unless initiatives at too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government a set some of the prices to low he would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area for six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there\nWas all over the edge I end up in your NDSU quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research well patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost\nWe definitely do subsidize the research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect\nBecause as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment any time there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along handling the FDA do everything I can to expedite\nThe availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact on we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... v\nThe price of the drug dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k.\nNow that is something we can control okay can do the other\nIt will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research\nPeople have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know from people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow I'm a first of all I had an enjoyable blood cancer or it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second liner drugs so\nThe need for innovation or new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a sealed Louis in the U.S Alex age are said recently drug\nCompanies have tried to tell us we can have innovation and affordable prices at the same time that if we caught one penny of profit from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt I was a pharmacy\nBeijing and America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex Caesar who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new drug for the for the research budget event ... next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development\nAnd then when the drug shows promise the drug companies swoop in and required intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year [laughter] so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return to balance from\nMaximizing profit for the drug companies to\nMaximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust aren't the pipeline we can do that as a country\nLikely by was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well I Want it to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year on research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring care you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here um folks that apply to medical schools from outside the U. S. they want to do their residency they want to do research uh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have to balance between\nA investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing a generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of the patent life\nI'm two or three new a medicine come to market and the price drop sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they um pay more for generics than we do here\nAnd they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries\nAs a percentage of their budget spend about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that um it's not the just medicines are more expensive and the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you miss the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we could do a better job of a you know we could address and we can lower overall cost ... costs\nNightly but a couple of quick things are just so you you said that uh\nThat uh once drugs come off patent generics pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can they're not always successful but they do what they can to extend those patterns I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that I think we have to at least acknowledge that\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly when the administration's views on religious liberty conflict with other priorities in the afternoon on all things considered from NPR News that is today\nFor doubled USF eighty nine point seven Tampa it's eleven o'clock\nMajor funding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found it Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nSomething to leave you are Boston and NPR ... this is on point\nOn all around the\nCorner of wanting to provide those immortal\nWords uttered by Neil Armstrong on the lunar surface July twenty Nineteen sixty nine but who was the man who took that giant leap a new movie explores Armstrong's quiet yet enormous life\nWe'll talk with his biographer about what made him the right man for the job is determination fortitude steady nice and calm in the face of professional and personal challenges of an excellent point Neal Armstrong first myth\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington ...

well\nUncovered but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration\nI think it'll be more of the fact that it allowed us to see things that\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nA scene from the movie first man well joining us now from New York is Alyssa Wilkins Wilkinson film critic for vox illicit welcome back to a point\nThanks for having me you know I think this movie because it's a depicting such a momentous momentous period in in American and human history people are reading all sorts of things into it uh so what's your take on it it is it a good movie\nYeah I mean I really really like\nOn it it is it a good movie\nYeah I mean I really really liked this movie I think one of the challenges for filmmakers who are making movies about really famous events that people watched on\nIs to find a new angle into this story something that can resonate and surprise\nUm the view whereas we're watching these very familiar events unfold\nAnd first manned manages to do it by going through basically Neil Armstrong's experience being part of the space mission and um how that links in with his personal life so bringing those two pieces together means that it's maybe a different take them people were expecting to see but it's also more personal and\nYou know maybe you didn't expect to cry during the movie about the moon landing but um but I think a lot of people will\nAn additional sponsorship for science friday in Tampa comes from H CIA group\nSupport for on point comes from ... gauge working to make higher

the first human being on the moon he\nMade that famous moon walk on the twentieth Nineteen sixty nine and now there's a new movie out at that largely focused on Neil Armstrong and it's based on the book first man the life of Neil Armstrong which has been written by James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and professor emeritus of history at Auburn\nUniversity a professor hands and I just want to hear a little bit from Neil Armstrong himself here because it back in two thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong at one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham live a mess you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in La Crosse if something goes wrong somewhere to go back out actually we ask you a lift off is really a big surprise [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five a game hands and you eat and you write in your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character demeanor and\nThere's a lot in the book where you write about why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on the moon and and not ... and and if I got to have to ask if I had this right Chris craft to is the chief of flight operations in Houston said ah that Neal was Neal calm\nQuiet and absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meaning what\nWill they knew that that the the person who are not just commanded the Apollo mission but more importantly in the sense of who was going to become the global like on the one who stepped out and represented humanity is the first step onto another heavenly body\nThat this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly and uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft and Dick's late ... corps and George Low who was a one of the big officials and the manned space program and Bob guild roof it was the director down in Houston\nIt was a very private conversations in fact it's this is you don't find this in any records only an oral history coming from draft\n'em and and that was that they were having a discussion they they knew this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that the person going I first they asked Ron going out first would be based on\nReally the interior lay out of the ... the way the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the ... and that always was what NASA told the public and even told you asked Rochester the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first because we had to open it would be difficult proposed to be the first one out\nBut in truth this you know just meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know could could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense too what are you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong or but it was also kind of a comment on bus I mean they knew was altering quite well and they knew he was a very very professional astronaut\nBut they also knew that personality wise you know bus was quite a bit different than you know he was very extroverted he was you know he was there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly uh and they were ...\nElement of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's manner of about eight\nWarm and made it very clear to me that he had told 'em um nicks lightened that he would not accept buzz on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a professional astronaut though they were just elements of buses personality which were a little difficult\nAnd Neal could handle them a man and bugs and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic\nWow interesting what let's step back in time considerably if we could uh I mean tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years they see here that did you first start flying at the age of six\nAnd uh he took us at first airplane ride and lay right okay I was sick of it and got his pilot's license on the sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile he had little interest in automobiles which is kind of surprising for avoid back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did\nTo buy a model airplanes that he built and in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure\nI'm some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true Neal didn't get interested in that so much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career you know ... as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu and Korea\nAnd becoming a test pilot he really led him to space was really not any you know Germany will passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the the wave of technology at an in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying or or or didn't fall but he was just hovering in history\nHe he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was it was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um I mean there was a spiritual side to win but he wasn't the sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became\nAnd so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because he you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much fat you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of of the type of proto engineer looked at\nThings but also he was saying like profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this is a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space and space exploration necessarily that drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was space that was the next step\nYeah that was the you know you'd be growing up in the thirties and they were so lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation and of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great\nIn flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights that ... of the post or the pre World War two era and he kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and now what's next [laughter] of course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to calm\nYeah well so give me and said I Want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the gap of\nHis two year old a daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just play a scene here from the movie first man and you'll hear Ryan Gosling plays Neal Armstrong ... he's asked about caring staff you know sorry to hear about your daughter [noise]\nSorry for your question [noise]\nPlaying a\nGame will have an effect [noise]\nUnreasonable to his own that it wouldn't have some effect\nThe scene for them to the first man didn't have to first of all tell us a little bit about uh Armstrong's daughter what happened to her\nWell may I say that in terms of that scene what I what's really strikes me um two things struck me the most medals won the ... the screenwriter used verbatim a quote that I mean what Neal says in that scene\nA about being unreasonable to assume that would have no effect\nThat comes directly from my interview with him back in early to thousands I because I asked him that specific question about did you think it had in fact one of his flying and on his crew choices afterwards and that exactly as what he's already answered so of course I Love that scene because it's it's exactly what Neal said\nTickets are at opposite little rap dot ORG this is W. us

Neal back in two thousand four I think it was\nAnd and there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played uh and and he had evidence he thought that in the electronic register of the the sound\nHad evidence he thought that in the electronic register of the the sound waves or that you could you saw something there that\nWas apparently an air temp to make the but there was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely meal you know Neal in the middle way told me said well just put you in parentheses\nWell Jim Hansen hold on here for just a second because I have to say this this moment\nAh for those people who witnessed the launching of the Saturn ... rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin a walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins or as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and older and we're on the the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people who remember it because\nSomething totally delightful happened to us this morning we uh got an email out of the blue from Maria lane she's in Watertown, Massachusetts because she had heard one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong said Maria send us email out of the blue\nAnd along with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um when the Apollo eleven cruel returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story and that we've invited Maria to be on the show with us and she joins us now real welcome to on point\nHigh magna thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent us because there are these beautiful black and white pictures of the ... the air stream of a light a vehicle that\nAh Armstrong an older than college were in after they came back to earth what were you doing in in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nWell I was visiting my uncle Frank uh who and his family and we were very close and um I was Thirteen\nAnd he was on heck um air force base is commander of a large\nSee one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course the Vietnam War yeah ah so um\nWe were we got word that the NASA mobile quarantine facility a streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean men were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh it's the pictures that you sent us a there's one in particular we we see you and your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph were Buzz Aldrin isn't the kind of waving ... yes\nYes [laughter] and the feeling was you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the moon\nYeah well so all these years later a Maria ... why is it to that you still feel such like a powerful residents to to that moment\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronaut their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened a and there was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went up in this space\nCapsule that looks like you know maybe a little bit rickety compared to do that today sophisticated spaceships it looks like a tin can be perfectly honest [laughter]\nExactly exactly yeah so it's still so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Maria lane from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you so much for getting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us those remarkable photographs were gonna share them\nGetting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us does remarkable photographs were going to share them with everyone who wants to see them on point radio dot org again it's images that Maria took in Hawaii of the mass NASA mobile quarantine unit the streamlined trailer with Buzz Aldrin waste from the window after he returned from the mood Maria thank you so much\nOh thank you I'm so thrilled\nWell let's go now to Margot who's calling from Portland Maine Margot you're on the air\nI ...

H. M. U. dot for the medical I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off you\nKnow a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect\nNot keeping people home or or a voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirt and going as hard as they can I ... in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about\nThe hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who is a professor at the University of Florida who is really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintain the turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primary than in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against the president and we've seen that according to Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nI Wonder one summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house\nCentral playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good effort and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks do you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks and they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voter infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there is a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that showed up for mid term elections typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters the millennial voters of color Latinos African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and midterm years\nIs there are certain benchmark Warner for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout like you use the goal just to get above sixty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan a congressman who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think that there's going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the House's blue but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pack of some ten feet or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three out turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be punished again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist pulling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat and your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling showing it to be double digit that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field when I ... game doubt or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats wouldn't half of those that the house\nTo hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the God love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House\nEnough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House for state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend but I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own in fact need to know if the raiders coach or not if it's a it's an issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I needed up all I Need some polls July to divide and it it actually changes my boat the oil change my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment Dominican\nThat cracks me up or if he wants to run for office you should run for office\nIf he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling in lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continued to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is the the tried and true a criticism um you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of\nWhat the next shots are within districts in fact I'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trend and you know issues and question\nThe of giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nI should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls on our website just search for it on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org\nJoin us for the CBC cue it comes away this evening at eight o'clock that is right after fresh air you're on WB USF eighty nine point seven your NPR station\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science same town nation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards the better more just society more information is available at ... foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with one of summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the medical months and are all still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a X.

P. R. dot org let's get some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and\nHow well are Democrats doing an answering it\nI think the largest went into it actually really common and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had I recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about or is that are sending out mailers or Glenn and knocking people doors in these battleground states\nTalking to voters that are sending out mailers are going and knocking people doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's base to um I was talking to some groups that dead some field testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out that if they got to try mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump's face on it they be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was\nSo I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think a Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo him in the car I Wonder if we can follow up on that scene was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what a John left in our inbox\nShould try and raise shirt to New York so often on the shows people for the Republicans for Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans touched down for our church helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\nThat to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did a regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy\nThat Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties saying for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in the winter\nStudio I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty [laughter] I don't think any party has a has Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do\nA it is a memorable and it certainly a builds that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... years there's plenty to do\nThat and that's why we have jobs here ... years [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... of out L G chi chi candidates running some from spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are a ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you\nThink of a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is a an openly gay man he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire the Democrat now\nBut when again and we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump was elected when we're talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination\nA hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three have been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hot that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined do or nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who have a nominee\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right it was a wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas have been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be\nVery fired up in poll after poll and you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between ... and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have\nA female senator in that seat I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSo I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates it's certainly more on the side of the Democrats than Republicans and I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to she women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went and\nFrom the local the local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's what's the group that cultivate and backed\nA pro abortion rights when female candidate so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleague that he actually asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came\nIn the back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and jets Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he's on them early and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that's something he doesn't like it something he wants to see more up but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if that's at such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where did as women come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have helping you don't have an apparatus\nIf it's a very tough it's very tactical if you don't have help and you don't have an apparatus that people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical or I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\nRunning or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before that long which is you gave on the Senate floor\nThat judgment [noise]\nSaturday afternoon at one here on W.

U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guest I just want to kind of add a yes and they meant to what the deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question and answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures with out a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Ross one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think the main thing that is\nThat what she right now it's sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year to sort of lagging there's prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quotes that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers so that their lives to crunch\nGlad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management had been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in

they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what's\nNo consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you Ryan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now a and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall ... after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups outpacing other industries by big margins are for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing has not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page\nAs someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas shell emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fares we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily or the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up\nIt's much better Christine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that it played over and million ah caters everyday into the city and out and many of those they're coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there is for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nYou see the roots about shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I I feel like you know my point of view is sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that at work in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of will be described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen

comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voice mail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in warehouse and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we were really struggling with two items one is employed turn over where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turn over and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely

launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business miles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really our home

ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family

health of regions like pork here at our Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together to play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from
