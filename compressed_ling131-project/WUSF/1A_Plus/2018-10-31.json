broadly speaking president Donald Trump is the guiding force and how the GOP is talking about immigration this campaign season and yesterday he amped up attention by saying he'd like to end birthright citizenship via executive order\nThat came out in an interview clip released by act CEOs in that clip the president incorrectly claimed that the U.S stands alone in granting birthright citizenship and then said he doesn't need a constitutional amendment to change that\nNow they're saying I can do just with an executive order [noise]\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits ridiculous it's ridiculous\nAnd again the president didn't correct in saying that the U.S is the only country that does this at least thirty nations have birthright citizenship according to the center for Immigration Studies and\nThat's a think tank that proposes a harder line on immigration well joining us now with more from Washington is ... immigration reporter for X. ios she co wrote the news story about the president's intentions and we have a

so first of all let me ask you specifically um who had actually spoken to or what have you heard from around the White House that made the seemed like it made it seem like it was a good question at the president about his views of birthright citizenship\nBy calling Jonathan Swann has been chasing this story for the past several weeks talking to\nSome of his sources close to the White House and it was not quite ready for published she's still needed to kind of get that confirmed but in preparation for the interview with the president for Axios on HBO he decided he would go ahead and ask the president directly\nWhat he had been hearing the tests that he had been given from his sources and we were surprised to see the president quite directly and quickly answered that question and assurance that yes he is planning an executive order and had spoken to his White House counsel about it\nOkay so planning an executive order did the president say in any more detail about whether or not one is is actually being drafted because it seems as if there's a lot of questions around whether or not this was the president saying it was something he wants to do eventually or if something is in the works\nWe'll be talking about that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I\nDo miss the take away it's coming up at three o'clock this afternoon here on your NPR station WBEZ\nWay it's

V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise]\nYou know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text to the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nThat's how Spiegel ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on the radio dot org\nAs well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan and they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue of unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets are about to immigration specifically so how's central is this as an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's as I started from Trump um he obviously this is something that worked for him in twenty sixteen\nIt wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and which Mexicans are coming into the country and all that um and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty sixteen political playbook\nAnd applying it to this midterm hum and it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really does care of and that really started it all them since October sixteenth um is really really started to you know they're going to them as such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threatened to tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the ... at this point and it's still about nine hundred miles away [noise]\nUm so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing this same tacked they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it in Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um it's not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nOh this has been the fascinating thing to see if you pull all Americans um number one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three immigration is fourth I'm this according to ...\nA gun policy is number three immigration is fourth I'm this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue ... them so clearly it's working for\nThe target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration is what riled up the as one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of of of enthusiasm when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no work in the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple we have illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that the obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that\nThe Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah things that do get done or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen ... let me turn back to you on that because one thing that jeeze comment makes me think of it and Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debate on the campaign trail in interviews\nA but are Democrats are responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with and she said at least in Republican minds at the number one important issue for them\nI'm trying to find out how ... million dollar gift could mean jobs for us

today by Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today he's with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... ... immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and we've got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first told us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tone\nAnd then mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that I Am totally in favor of sending troops to the border\nThey care I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious that the\nPeople are getting aid somewhere they have water bottles they have they have money [noise] something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America and also on a I'm not there no I Believe in voter ID I hadn't even get once you get a library card\nI have to have identification to get a loan to open a credit card\nTo get a library card to start utilities there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it\nWhy can't they have id to vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call there uh I wouldn't go I mean you hear Laurie feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who is immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concern the issues are concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned zero due to his one violence that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republican\nUm you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this care of it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel in ... for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America and Mexico is a very dangerous in Denver\nUm so they've started for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely and the last ... care of and that got here I think provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them um did exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and ... that we have embedded with the Caribbean moving through Mexico\nUm the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um it it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee so it's going to take a long time and by the time to get here it's going to be far fewer people and not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or take over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm feeling a little early in the show and then just clarify here that they are they're trying to ... author seeking just merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is a the ... the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and some of the other\nUh tragedies we've seen recently um but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban\nUm shortly after Trump took office\nIt was the first two versions of that travel ban were shut down by the courts but the third one survived and so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second if and when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could throw out here right\nNow who argue that you're there in El Paso and I wonder if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh we between incumbent representative\nA Republican we'll heard and Gina Ortiz Jones had his Democratic challenger right because the debt that is that heard represents has said many hundreds of miles up on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the ... border and it stretches from ... county [noise]\nUh all the way to the outskirts county which is includes San Antonio and Big Bend in several border counties in between you know this this this was considered a ... a few months ago but the latest polling shows that\nCongressman or it is a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um which is shut down then pose a significant challenge\nAnd still you know that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back twenty six they say well at the end of the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving the Democrats and Andy protects us a little bit of hope but\nI'm confident heard also you know it was very public about his is the way he strives for bipartisanship and um you know he and and\nThe way he strives for bipartisanship um you know he and and ... actually they you know they did that Facebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to to the sea and they they ended up in the Pittsburgh live up their journey which\nI think when I'm pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress rent to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas you know they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like port security but they are also I'm a ... by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they think is an action you know you talk to [noise]\nTo ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going to their property and that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries and to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of of his constituents has done a pretty good job of trying to strike a middle down he's been\nSomewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but closer to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the to the extreme and um and to Mr Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect and we don't know how many people are gonna end up coming here and what I saw on the bridge and she was on Tuesday was migrants that were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so with respect to to the caller's concerns and illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when there's a lot of people are definitely doing\nYou know the the herd Jones raises interesting to me because uh will hurt and then I think he he represents as he is you were saying earlier how um\nThe views of communities on the border I'm much more they're more subtle and textured\nThan we might see a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border 'cause I Know her to a very eloquent I'm advocating for more smart well technology emerges hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico but we don't want to call in here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking the call uh I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense um end to play defense against emotional appeals and instead focus on this rational discussion or\nUm I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think better work brings some of them out surveys show that the American public\nFavors a permanent status for the dreamers that was sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats can make the point that immigration is solved the problem with immigration and be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Alan Gomez let me turn to you is that what you're hearing from Democrats and we just hearing more ... town\nI mean I think it's interesting there do they use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic responds because\nIt to some degree so there is there's quite a bit of fear for the ... over the summer um with this abolish ice movement that that only a very small number of Democrats really truly embrace um but that became something that will slept on everybody every democratic candidate Ted Cruz grew better route\nJoin us for all things considered at four o'clock this afternoon you're

and she's talking with us this hour from Savannah Georgia and you can join us where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talk what is your question for America's most preeminent a costume designer who is telling the visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric that she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nA routine Carter let me ask you can just jump back in time deep back in time here because I\nRead a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume design it is that right\nYes um when I was a younger ah the junior high school and through high school my uh mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker and what's the free counseling service for the city\nAnd people could drop in and get services counseling services so\nShe knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew the homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her through um you know downtown or down go to ... she drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh\nIn point or hide you know hide in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know sometimes she would even role that window down to our dismay and\nSay you know how ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of you know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and\nYou know just taking it all in\nYeah 'cause it suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly perjury you know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear in a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the role of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as the viewers\nI feel that costume design or can be just to find his story telling design and you when people want to associate costume designer with fashion\nAnd you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but the overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script\nThe story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm In Hollywood I mean well just let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee because you've done what Fifteen plus collaboration with him and\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter]\nUm I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for\nAnd it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends and\nI I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee um afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so\nI kept you know modeling around him I have this idea of getting film experienced and he suggested\nThat I call us see or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student these projects have said that would give me experience with being on a set\nAnd what that medium um would be like yeah and so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on a U.S see student film\nOr doing the costumes are well and then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right thing so I Want to play a clip\nOn that day it was actually the first one and then do the right then do the right thing okay\nI wouldn't be less likely fed that they're like get your philanthropy\nRight leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movies to this day so I just want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out and he asked sell the owner of the local pizzeria played by Danny halo\nOr why they're only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\n... if you want rollers on Wall Street Journal which which one would\nGet a bunch of brothers are novels and these are the fusion stepfather stepmother whoever was the fourth of July as\nAmerican as high as on the wall you also\nYou know might be fine so what do you watch the any American is laughable so since we we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer\nUh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee and the thing about this film outrageous I may say is that it really one of its many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality\nOf what the characters are wary like high tops the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design well\nIt was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color on Nike was a huge part\nAnd really saturated color on Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing or during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and\nWe really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and really create this um this intensity of color in their environment and so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics\nAnd you see bugging out wearing can take off shore it's that we made and\nIt was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really had\nThat stuff would go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and so because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of color and\nAnd the styles that um we present to kind of all feed fed into the combination of what eventually happened story\nWill ah we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some questions raised so if you turn to them to be a delight we\nWere talking through the card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X. in ... but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer on then that means we\nDouble checked [laughter] and and I didn't want any more TV project [laughter] I [laughter] your group and again congratulations to you for that but we're the one eight hundred forty three eight to five five eight hundred and forty three talk so let's go to Tanya who's calling from Detroit Michigan Tanya you're on the air\nNew venture begins Wednesday October thirty first nine right here on

designer she got those nods for Malcolm X and ... and her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume designer for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what love got to do with it and Selma as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of river Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and fuel striped tie and a styling black overcooked\nWonderful [noise] I don't want to [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI don't show\nUp [noise] [noise]\nSee from the two dozen fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who's playing Dr King\nWell there are several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king or several books pictorial books that have been written and\nSo the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was busted men and\nIf you look at him and his suit you noticed that you know there's a little flushed the area around the color of his neck where he button down shirt and it would kind of rule over the top\nAnd David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is he gained weight for the role um and I want to just sort of\nHelp that along and I made his shirt college at least smaller than what we what would be required so that I can also see that little neck role that happened I'm at the color of king shirt\nSee that little neck role that happened I'm at the collar of king shirt I Love\nThat detail [laughter] I don't think I Would have ever noticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character\nYeah and the costume has to support the actor there has to help support their performance and I'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs do you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that\nNow to David every day the shirt colors were too tight um he never come out and I would say he never complained um maybe it just felt right right for him and ah when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk call us with your questions for the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI met an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I saw a Black Panther in the theater I was just blown\nAway not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity I met future who's been working on a project on how we can use\nTextiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here of opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn three D. print things they could talk about textiles with special technology in them like the black Panthers suit the stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into\nA fabric how would you do it there's so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nSarah thank you for your cold Ruthie of a response\nFor yes um what I Love about series lab\nIs that it's a a it's an exploration\nAnd what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children to can do and she certainly does represent that you know she I imagined was the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black Panthers\nSuit and and I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning\nA ruse if I may I Want to talk for a minute or two or hear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film\nI'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here\nIn the films Nineteen Ninety seven and you can hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym in a zoo who stands up\nUh during the mutiny trial he's put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nFor reasons for the front of a kind of disrupt these proceedings which I Do\n\n[noise]\n\n\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven film I'm is not that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a scene king is wearing a western clothes right\nYes ah the abolitionist\nI and the reading we read that the abolition escape from clothing to the African than there was an account that said in the courtroom they look like dogs sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um\nClothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the cage and I also wanted to present him in a royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free\nAnd you'll notice that um the African sitting there in the gallery or mostly in these white bill Louis shirts up the period and I wanted to evoke the feeling of a\n... is it also a comedian's readings wrong because I I I thought the part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on just if was as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a so that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you were saying that this regal feel to him\nYes yes and I was the ... the parrot period was a very below he pleaded ruffled shirt yeah\nAnd and this is a particularly interesting film to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the film\nOff um yes John Adams yeah\nAnd you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters\nAnd also the history of the court case of the ... and all those things are important to paint the picture of royalty and the African says you know when they first embark in Mystic Connecticut\nThey are wearing blankets and", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "31"}
