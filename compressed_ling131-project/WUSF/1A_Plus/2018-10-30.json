on point radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook at on point radio\nNow we will talk a lot about the Global Trends in democracy and they push back against democracy but first of all let's take stock of what happened in Brazil this weekend\nJoining me now from the capital Brasilia is recall it Brazilian ... bureau chief for Bloomberg News ray welcome to appoint\nBaggage from attract enough\nSo first of all described how significant is the fact that a ... one of the presidential election in Brazil it it does seem to be a profound shift to the right for what what is by far a south America's largest democracy [noise]\nIt's a tectonic shift or frankly a first time that are right wing government comes to power since uh Brazil returned to democracy in in Nineteen eighty five but also the first time that the the left wing\nIn in Nineteen eighty five but also the first time that the the left wing party the workers' party of of Lula a lost since two thousand and two\nUm so it it it's clearly a move 'em that takes Brazil or Latin America's largest nation into an entirely different direction what remains to be seen as to what extent um the rest of the country goes along are we also know that ... had a very high\nRejection rate above forty percent\nI'm so he has come to power in part um because of this huge rejection where the traditional political class um but at the same time not everybody is with them\nYeah to tell us a little bit more about both himself he's a former member of the Brazilian military member of the Brazilian Congress but until recently was dismissed as as unelectable because of a you know his long history of of seeing that divisive things to say the least\nYes absolutely every race a slur as the uh some some despicable comments about about a women\nAre things you don't necessarily want I don't want to repeat um and and what what's particularly odd about him is that for twenty eight years nearly three decades he sat in Congress sort of a back bench or nobody had heard of and they haven't really done anything\nYou'll tune into the take away the afternoon at three o'clock\nFor example when you're you mentioned that lady I talked about that particular that you that you would argue against shoot defending the gentler that'd be headed and raped a girl you live in that situation so he was he was he was so limited\nThat a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that at the level of conversation that he has to go again up in Brazil yeah you're looking at people that go to jail they go to jail\nOr things that will get capital punishment here in the U.S they'll go to jail they'll START I don't know three four years and then they'll leave right\nJust a young young lady that killed their parents uh she wasn't able to get out of jail for a for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call I hear your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry Diamond Michael very clearly saying that the problems in Brazil so overwhelming that both the more just to stay useful parts and he may not approve of in both narrow fall by the wayside\nWill I think it's great to Michael called them because we now have a direct expression of the frustration and anger that produce the victory for this extreme right and I said fairly exclusively authoritarian candidate\nAnd the problem is that when you as a voter a turn to or feel that you have little choice but to turn to such a blunt and Savage instrument as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy you're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna uh when we look at what's going on in the world now but also the history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office they know failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about his authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is a severe risk right now\nI'm I'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying uh Larry Diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo ... their ... who was has been very outspoken about his crackdown on um drugs and violence there\nOr to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in\nThe Philippines and in twenty sixteen he actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers ...\nPlus or three million you know it's the meal that are [noise] and these are just not something\nThat's still opinion president Rodrigo de ... saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to slaughter them\nA bit last time and I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners um that wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the ... end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but Sean ... says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he said I'm outraged that citizens of the foreign country can vote their free will and someone calling themselves ... said is it really a pushback on democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in a legitimate election\nWhat do you think what I'd say a few things\nThe ... election what do you think what I'd say a few things I'm number one or two ... actually has presided over the extrajudicial killing of well over twelve thousand people on the streets of the Philippines\nSo um when autocrats signal their intentions are ... we have to take them seriously\nSecondly although there is rising despair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy and Brazil and that is certainly not what Brazilian voters want I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action to reform and climbs the system\nSo you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they are\nBut that doesn't give both Sonora license to close down the Congress to close down the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties and I think Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant\nUh as we should be a from the international community and ensuring that both in our addresses Brazil's problems in a way but don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\nYeah we'll Larry Diamond let me just bring in another voice into the conversation Laura king joins us today from Washington She's global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles times Laura king welcome to on

democracy with the rise of ... leaders around the world\nUh I'm just wondering if you see any sort of you or what are the unifying features that you see in what brought them to power I mean I I ... the situation on the ground in each of these countries are slightly different but it seems to be that to me that one of the things that defined all of these leaders and I would include Donald Trump

Laura's let me just get some callers in here Alice is calling from Norwalk, Connecticut Alice you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em it's been reported that Steve Bannon was an advisor to both an arrow in his bid for the presidency and as you know he was chief strategist for Donald Trump in his twenties sixteen presidential election\nA kind of appalled by uh the fact that Trump utilized him a given the fact that Bannon is as he says a populist but\nIn my opinion is is actually a white nationalist and I'm Wondering what your guest thought about his influence on in this election\nUm it's disturbing to me that he also supported Marine Le pen and ... you know her bid for for a her election in France\nWill look at me just let me let the since you asked a good question let me a letter panelist respond thank you for your call a lawyer a king us Steve Bannon is still working to spread populism throughout the world what influence or ruled that he had to play if any in Brazil\nWell in terms of Brazil I'm not I'm not I'm not so well versed in them but I Would I Would say that one thing that's been interesting about Mr Bannon is that he's he's encountered some some rejection and some resistance from even some of the European nationalist with with him he's seeking to\nStay out of it and and and that does kind of reflect their their sense of of of at a homegrown homegrown um tradition that\nDidn't make it and didn't they just read though that um materials solving any ah Italy is the deputy prime minister I'm actually joined a band and his organization called the movement that he founded to spread populous politics and basically undermine the European Union ... that you happened recently right\nWill Mr Bannon I think has has sought actively to to export his what he did for Mr Trump to to Europe and that has that has pretty much been a driving force behind what he's been doing since the since he left the White House I see\nSo let's go to Jill who's calling from St Helena island South Carolina Julie you're on the air\nI like now I just wanted to say that a strong arm tactics and they work in the short term however they're not sustainable over a long time you may get a few quick when the only way to move forward and not end up and\nDown Nate is to actually put the time in ... relationship with the people you need to work with or even if you look in\nIn the business you're dealing a process re design you need to get by in an all members of the team and if you don't on the news is skip that work of relationship building you're always going to have people working to undermine progress\nEven at the progress benefit every one\nMm Jill thank you for your call Larry Diamond um do do people do politicians have the time though to ... to build those those relationships to garner that consensus that Joe is talking about its requisite for a successful democracy\nUm will magna I'd like to take it back to Brazil or I may I think uh the question it's not time but a structural incentives particularly if you want to make government work which really important requires making Congress work\nWe have our own challenges here in the United states but it's important that we not close the hour without noting of fundamental structural impediments\nTo a decent governance in Brazil which is that you've got now Twenty one party's sitting in the Senate thirty parties sitting in the Congress bows or records for Brazilian democracy at least in the current era\nAnd because of this extreme system of proportional representation one reason why you've had so much corruption\nIn Brazil is the president's need to ... throw around money corrupt lay in order to set a symbol\nCongressional majorities out of this mix and as the former president Fernando Enrique ... said they've got to fix this system and create a more rational smaller party Congress\nMm oh Laura king is to just if I if I can I mean we've been focusing on Brazil up because it's um blurry rightly points out it's just happened and there's a lot of specific things to talk about\nAh regarding of Brazil at the moment but you know should have done this earlier Loren I'm Sorry that I didn't but I Wonder if you could just sort of briefly tell us what countries you would consider\nUm you know part of this rise of uh the strongman trend we should be saying we've talked about the Philippines and talked about Brazil um we you know you mentioned the United states even Russia China what else would you would you include in that list\nWell I did have a chance to spend time recently in Poland and Hungary and I would certainly count them among among this trend and I would say I'm In stone\nAmong among this trend and I would say I'm Still in touch with some people in Egypt in Turkey from the time that I spent there when I when I Lived in those countries and there's a there's a sense of a real real alarm in a real sense that things are getting worse and worse\nSo turkey in Egypt as well okay no Larry earlier in the hour mentioned a moody in India does he fall into this category\nOh I think so definitely\nAnd Larry what do you think\nI spent a motor used in no way a as blatant a photo of democracy is both tomorrow is ... you know really believes\nInvests in elections a and there's never spoken about closing down democracy but he's certainly leaning hard on opposition and on civil liberties and that's a warning sign to really watch carefully\nMm well let's go to Tony who's calling from Seattle, Washington county you're on the air\nHigh that\nThat I was wondering how much of this might be a reaction to the global women's there's not that we think recently um I Know in central and South America it's quite a macho culture I don't know if there's some anxiety around um\nThe women's movement to I Know when it's done and also um advocates for other civil rights causes and be a threat to our authoritative here authoritarian strongman dictatorships so I didn't know you have a I'm a sociologist there or is he saying\nAnything and it limits face them kind of a such a lick reaction to that and it's lovely honey thanks for your call Larry Diamond what do you think\nI think the ... or earlier there was a reference to be a threat from cultural and social change the driving a lot of the some of the return reaction\nAnd it's not only three decades or more of the women's uh rights movement but gay rights from a immigrant rights and so on\nBut I don't think this can explain the immediate uh six or ... or other right wing alternatives it's very much response as well\nTo economic distress economic and security and a general failure of government so what the caller described as just one of many strands of unease\nAnd reaction ... let's go to Peggy who's calling from Springfield, Illinois you're on the air\nYes um I've been hearing people talk about this illusion with globalization and from my observation I think we've made a terrible terrible mistake and equating our democracy\nThe kind of hard edge capitalism that we are now living under when it's operates globally ...\n... I think that this solution has been terrible because democracy is something everyone was but then when we say we've got it and it's causing chaos and inequality people get very disillusioned\nAnd we hope you'll tune in for all things considered coming up at four o'clock this afternoon you're listening to W.

I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps a success is based on how self directed a child is\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they want all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\nRight [noise] well you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter] so\nThis issue of self directed what has been to be self directed um\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLooking at little kids have you ever seen a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious and playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there what's new what can I learn about [noise]\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch [noise]\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them\nSo I'm schooling is this what if we just left them continue to do that and that of put them away where their own questions don't count anymore where their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about [noise] socialization being missing if you're not going to school or what kind of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness so they have the ability to something here\nFor a second I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where haven't you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a myth quote okay I tried to get them to change that and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete misquoted [noise]\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of construction and\nUh I have yet to see a child who's been in self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read it very different ages\nRight well so here's why I'm asking that question because if we're lucky\nEvery different ages right well here's what I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them a ... it is in the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh\nYou know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of sending them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning it are they learning it in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights literally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics is that a real civics lesson or is a better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lesson than a lecture on it you are living it\nYou are limited in what in what though that that you'll have ultimate the total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nBut you know something yes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society\nThey are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody is totally free nobody can do things that break the law you know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or school years learning stuff\nAnd they make rules they make the rules democratically there are lots of rules you can't literally you care if you take out toward you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules\nAnd isn't that a better civics lesson\n... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subject to children if they're totally self directed\nWell I'm from me I I question what the word introduced me\nAnd in this context because introducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so\nInto the idea that these things will not be introduced or seen or felt as something that I don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics at its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready\nAnd whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground mhm I there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to\nIssues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to going to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge and to making sure that their identity is affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions\nThat creating ... and diversity and equity so\nThat has nothing to do with school\nWell a ... and Peter you can imagine that we have a lot of [laughter] a lot to join us so let me just get a couple of them in here let's go to Alex is calling from big sky Montana Alex you're on the air\nHigh maintenance thank you so much for taking my call great conversation today um you know I just want to say that I Am thirty eight years old I was raised in the Massachusetts public school system in my parents' absolutely\nPractice something very similar to this on schooling or perhaps a free range parenting and certainly they didn't call it that but the ethos with very similar um you know they would\nPull me out of class to go to a museum or go see a movie to go see family or friends if I was in a class and um had you'd be completed my work early or just didn't feel engaged with the lesson of the day they would uh have you moved over to\nAnother class and I'm I'm occasion even take me to another school across town to do something over there and\nYou know I can attest that it absolutely bread a sense of curiosity and playfulness for this with me to this day but there's a double edged sword that I think anyone should really consider if they are thinking about\nVenture begins Wednesday October thirty first is nine right here on double us up maybe nine points of\n\n\nSupport for on point comes from W.

T. L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making talk her body we're talking this hour about the un schooling movement and I'm joined by ... digs Peter gray and Michael Apple and I should let the three if he notes that the comments and colds are all pouring in we pick these topics that we should talk about for two to three hours at a time but\nBut we've got some pushback coming in uh on line for example Joe American or sent us this tweet saying this sounds like another progressive concept that will result in deficiencies in knowledge and a greater dependency on government just more collective ism packaged as social improvement\nOn our website on point radio dot org ... says uh and Kathy this isn't a response a response to something you said ...\nKathy saying no an amusement park is not physics physics is the math and process that results in a safe and exciting amusement park rides\nCat he thinks this sounds just like whew nonsense ... would you like to respond to that\nI mean for a cafe then that's that's her position and I totally respect that\nUm for me I see it differently and that's that's what makes us all unique and the biggest the biggest thing about this about exploring what learning is is the liberation of being indoctrinated into a system that wasn't built for a person like myself\nIt was not built for me to truly explore and be innovative and look at this as an opportunity to really shine and that's what I'm allowing my children to do\nWhether it has an effect that may be viewed as negative or not that's you know how anyone feels is none of my business is pretty much the model I follow so as much as I appreciate her perspective um\nThat's that's what works for us\nAnd my children are learning and growing and thriving so why does it matter to me\nAnd I also have another comment here on Facebook Jennifer Russell says formal school doesn't teach children socialization Jennifer says it teaches them institutionalization let's go to Steven who's calling from Florence South Carolina Steven you're on the air\nThank you very much my questions I Hope aren't too simplistic but if you could tell me what sort of things should I look for my child to see he's a good candidate for this book or lean at what I should it again and worked for the parameters or\nBoundaries are needed if we go into the sort of um in educational process\nSteven first of all I'm going to tell you there is no such thing on this program as overly simplistic question especially when we're talking about education so I actually thank you very much for your call Peter gray do you have some answers receiving\nThe question well when to begin\nPeter gray do you have some answers the question well Wendy began it begins at birth [laughter] you you can't stop it from beginning at birth children now beginning to self educated as soon as they're ... they're learning constantly they're constantly learning [noise]\nSo one of the questions that I've been interested in my own research just there are there some children who are more cut out for self directed education than for others and this is many people think well some people are sort of self motivated they can take control of their own life and so on\nMy experience has been that little children are all self motivated and that doesn't end if we allow it to continue it does not end if we allow it to continue\nI think the I think the important thing to ask for anybody who wants to take this route\nIs am I capable of trusting my child am I capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control now the truth of the matter\nIs reeling chair and my heart and let her has there's this guy I\nGive up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research that just because of my own experience with my own child them because of my research with many children\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout almost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had [noise]\nAnd so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on\nBut here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly learn and who's to decide what's most important for any given child\nDon't we want people to grow up learning different aspects of that knowledge why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and the information\nThat schools have decided that says the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else maybe\nWe'll never learn they don't have a shot OK you driving isn't that the ... ...\nYour child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows is that the graduate so self directed education\nAre doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting jobs let me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nOh first START I I appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask one of the characteristics of the children of parents are doing really want to society in which we are the children are simply the property of their parents when there's a growing movement in the United states\nFor instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti yeah clearly racist trying to change\nAnd I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best\nFor their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now and ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we wrong\nWhat is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticize situations\nThat are that we're putting parents and so that's my first my first response fucking does um we have to ask\nDo we want a simply to have a society in which her children are simply and parents having no responsibility whatsoever for a larger society what can we do\nTo make it more certain that the vast majority of children who will go to public schools actually get the kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie computer won right\nWell Michael let me let the Peter Graham illegal responded that Peter go\nAhead I I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and it's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to let me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problem\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and that works very well for their children\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system\nBecause the public school system has too many constraints you can move a certain direct the certain amount and the progressive direction but then there's always the push back to go back and the other way ever since schools have become compulsory we've had progressive educators trying to push it one way and that gets pushed back the other way\nIt's happening outside the public school system but it's happening in a way that it could eventually become affordable to everybody and I would love to see public support for this right now the alliance for self directed education is trying to bring public support\nFor Centers for self directed education so that children can be away from their parents they could be in the center\nWhere they have to learn the kind of community skills how to make rules how to live by rules how to get along with people who are different from you and have different ideas from yours different ideas from your parents

H. M. A. U. dot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surgeon early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H um public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nSo we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges adventure election just can turn out is higher here in Michigan edited across the country during the presidential election 'til we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point\nNine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million at of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or a near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nAre there saying requests in in one of the most populated county Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had request for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting works in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are are you can also request a ballot to get in the mail vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request steady and you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who liked early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had to early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened up a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to take that option we heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how does early voting work\nWell ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you\nGot to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um [noise] you go through the subjects one by one it's great because uh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here to Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or or\nSome other kind of relaxing recreational or kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to do it with\nTheir Jacqueline um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado a but not everyone um you know that ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should Baron ...\nSomething that everyone who lives in a state with early voting early voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just to be that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that if you're in mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be kept exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan it's if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say sure I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and why are they are all sorts of other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be over sixty years old or another is maybe due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it it's\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot ... what is being over sixty has to do with\nVoting early ah possibly to make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to\nSit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote for that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWhich we can do silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael ... an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy and the environment for K. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays I liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home\nAmen to that ...

children and want them to see and feel the import of this right\nAnd Melissa tweeted I Love to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nIt was only I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're at one a vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting have to do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation\nProposal and to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote and she makes ... voting available to all and finally to prove it straight ticket voting those are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving his voice mail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that a kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking about proposal to which is a redistricting as he is ... and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been at a bar and storm of\nA ballot I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Fay he's twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prompt to which if past will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear voter district de ... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and\nThe kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan Anders tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which I tend to lean towards conservative Republican candidates I come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom find which is on\nI I get money from a ... organization just last week uh putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is to promote the vote which would allow a enshrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you as another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year\nWould increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me\nThat the ads we see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by a lot of companies and they say you're going to lose all your jobs all your schools are going to close\nFires going to rain down from the sky it it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly vis counter argument the gym so she's ... she's been seeing on TV ads\nSure it will be a ... to put a finger pointing out at right now there are also a a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are an ... supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells\nAre just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's homes schools places at work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh they admit pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which is which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site a but just how difficult that is will you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted\nA but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that use the slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost in with it\nUm there are jobs and a potential economic impacts estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side of supporters one twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuate\nOne twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has fluctuated and decline in recent years and it it's now about five percent of the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be

attack in Pittsburgh there was the shooting at the church in Sutherland Springs Texas earlier this year there was of course the church shooting in Charleston South Carolina a few years of a few years ago\nWhat is it about places of worship that make them such targets well I think one thing Joshua is that places of worship segregate people according to their religion and to some extent according to their ethnicity or race so\nIf you want to target Jews where would you go you go to a synagogue because we're going to be all Jews there do you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people you can go to it a predominantly black church I mean so it's convenient in that sense you know in the in the sense that it allows the\nThe perpetrator to sort of zero in on the people that he wants to hurt\nIt's also really a challenge to their identity and if you really want to hurt those people go to their place of worship ... that is obviously so central to who they are\nKind of an easy collection of targets kind of concentrated by what you want to target an also a soft target in the in the true sense\nYes exactly soft target you know\nThe adventure begins

weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh and it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church\nBack in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that's suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently we discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here is the first part of our conversation Josh what's great to be with you today\nThank you describe your congregation United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or tell us about your congregation and\nBully would've suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City is a downtown Kansas City Missouri was friends with three and a couple and the Kansas on and it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated\nWe have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independence of divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we're we're pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions of the ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folk saying well you know you're being too political and we shouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper\nSense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely you know I pray that when you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system to value system\nYou as a as a pastor is a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know typing earlier I just do a sermon on the story of the garden of anything\nHaving or just do a sermon on the story of the garden to be anything but politics yeah so here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing it all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and it probably Sunday Morning ten and again probably spending morning and so what upset is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those ... preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are sharing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYear round of what they're already getting every day [noise]\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where when are the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or what are the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lick electron ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one site has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but as I say this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality and actual policy yeah uh it does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in the school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities is presenting issue\nAnd so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another parts it's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lift it up for five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense\nAnd in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting\nThe world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want us to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got it can be so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and need help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers what does your congregation\nWant from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with the social issues that they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture but did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you\nKnow the answer is yes [laughter] I don't know if I if I get emails across the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like ... so the immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated or the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that and there but here we we also serve the congregation recently to find out\nWe were doing a worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they wanted to ask about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and then I'm On a response was when Adam deals with current issues when he's dealing with what's going on in the world but for every person who says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you're just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam Hamilton to founding pastor of the United

deep and deepening divide and again there's been a lot of criticism of the tone being set by President Trump but it's not a one way street here some of the messages you left in our inbox\nThis is Steve from suburban Park Maryland my concern is the constant resorting to violence and quote quote in your face politics and actions by both sides the left and the right the Dems and the Republicans\nHounding people out of restaurants is not a good way to start a good civil political discourse\nSupposed to talk to them well I hear your focused on the political like when she into more

in the synagogue when the shooter came in we need to stop teaching hate\nEveryone who hates has been taught whom and how to uh rationally blame accused threatening target we've lost some of the finest people in our community people always put loving and caring ahead of everything\nWe do is teach our children that for thousands of years we've been the targets and we expect that it will continue it's our job to be stronger and to keep trying to teach everyone a better way of life but\nWe've lost these particular tones and the canvas of our congregations we've lost their chair and their laughter and their boundless optimism may their souls be bound and the bonds of life eternal we are greatly reduced without them\nYou're always welcome to add your voice to the conversation feel free to leave us a voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one to one to\nHow we move forward as one is something we talked about was pastor Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest method\nHamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist congregation now a recent study found that Methodist or one of the nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up the conversation\nHow do you help your congregation see themselves as children of God first\nI think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks this kind of political do ... which to me is both boring and dehumanizing right and it just negates the three dimension Audi of of humanity\nI Wonder how you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation to\nHelp keep people seeing one another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and pass the politics\nYeah so that is something that we talked about regularly and I try to model for them the modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so in the during to up to have sixteen I had our our country's human rights to versus\nA door to others as you have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're going to memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and then there was a a ... I think I actually have three I think the second one was love your neighbors all have yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the aisle or somebody who's ... you know love Trump or somebody who hates Trump how are you going to love them\nBecause you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President the gutters deeply about what you love your fellow human beings\nAnd John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say your love of God you can't see and uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up and there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd it's just not not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media how are you\nAllow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you could apply\nTo become a passage that offer some people who we just need to lead habit feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now you know and I feel like it's just it's too satisfying to take\nThe moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are that I Need the here\nAnd I have the answer and you need to share it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue age now feels to satisfy that finally let her out\nI think that's exactly right I think that's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it\nIt naturally no there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think about sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but it could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nWhat if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the nuances of the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull it verse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments as you cannot have a complex argument in two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter and thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have the\nWith a double the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know a nifty responses on Facebook to somebody's post and you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching\nAnd prophetic preaching has to do was saying the hard things you know and addressing justice in and righteousness all these things\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to hurt their feelings or irritate them or make the mad\nBut if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your family and friends who might have different views you got to say how could I Do that in a way that my mom who feel totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before\nAnd that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues are typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this as well here's what level people on the side it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this\nBut if you're on the other side I Know how much I Love you and you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon so I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came and ready to hate oh yeah yeah but then the way you approached my side open my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's gotta be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm you know it just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation and who knows the obligation on a pastor and who's trying I'm sure trying not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told\nI was ready to a church or whatever I Believe it\nOr that before I let you go past her Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told them in our polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place it's are defining value is love\nSo if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation what hope is there for the world\nSo I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study recite school class of people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides I mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nCompletely black and white if they were we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty turned fifty four next month when I was in my twenties and thirties\nEvery one of those letters just felt like an arrow driven into my heart it was so hard and I'd feel like I'd have to ratify paid response to them and I would say two on it for a long time you know and I was ready to quit if I got plenty of those you know emails and a week and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city":
