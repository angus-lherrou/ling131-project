Boston and NPR I make the chalk liberty and this is on point almost half of democratic ads run this far in the mid term elections have focused on one thing\nHealth care it is one of the defining issue if nothing uniquely defining one on the campaign trail right now\nUp to one hundred thirty million Americans may have some kind of pre existing condition one of the reasons why the geo peas push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has put Republican candidates in the position of trying to convince voters that they're protecting one of Obamacare's most popular provisions\nWell also trying to end the law itself the voters are very passionate about this issue but how much of that passion will translate at the ballot box this hour on point healthcare and the midterms and we want to hear from you is health care the issue that will define or at least influence how you vote\nWhat have you been hearing from candidates in congressional races in your district\nAbout the Affordable CARE Act in the future of health care in America and are you liking what you're hearing where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime

covering the very interesting race a Senate race in Missouri\nJamon is welcome to appoint\nHigh magnet thanks for having me it's great to have you know of course that Senate race is between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and a Republican candidate Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley so how much is health care defining or how the two are engaging with each other or asking for people for their vote\nWell on on her side I Would say it's probably eighty five percent a I mean it's a major major focus of McCaskill most of the ads that she is paying for our about healthcare a she has been she conducts\n[noise] are about healthcare a she has been she conducted over fifty town hall or was the last year and a half\nAnd it quickly became apparent that health care was the big issue she actually started focusing on it before many other Democrats elsewhere in the country did I covered her first one about Eighteen months ago and that's when some of the started now with a health\nCare was the big issue for her or for voters engaging with her the\nTown or voters engaging with her and what were the very first one in April twenty Seventeen and it was brought up then and by the time I caught up with her at another one I'm a year ago in October twenty Seventeen\nThat was a major major focus of most of the people in the audience and these were open town hall these were just open to anybody not not particularly partisan and what would people saying to her\nWhile they were concerned ah because at that time if you recall on twenty Seventeen or that's one of the votes for taking\nA in Washington about doing away with the Affordable CARE Act and while people have had issues with it ah people many of the public or we're getting concerned because a either they were getting their um health care on the exchange or they were concerned about how it was going to affect\nAh the coverage that they had one of the problems in Missouri out out of the urban areas in the rural areas we did

D D L E y travel doctor\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much people's attitudes in hopes for the American health care system may influence their vote\nOr in these midterm races were speaking today with Jonathan Cohn ... national is a senior national correspondent at huff post covering health care social welfare and politics too man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for St Louis public radio\nUh and I want to play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristian cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha ... they're a vote both are running for Senate\nIn Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that air at science are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha have voted to take that protection a way\nThat that is just a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics if you turn on TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people a pre existing conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and make Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the blocks that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people are finding themselves and how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash or record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is this the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance then you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good uh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good at figuring out how not to cover builds from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing conditions so the problem with what the Republicans have done when confronted with as when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they like that protection for pre existing\nWith everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they like that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop\nOr insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's to house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley floats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nBut health care in this country is so complicated that even when someone you know who that is well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain or goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposal that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is a debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level um that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that well\nLet me give you just a couple of quick examples I covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise]\nUm I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly\nOkay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb of one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions\nAnd he collars Holly and ask them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd Holly's giving the answer and I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the Affordable CARE Act this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally no these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave a speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nParties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWill will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Hawley had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him yes okay so So Jonathan code that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know again because of the complications of healthcare\nUm is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nYou know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um ... as President Trump's that healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information\nAs President Trump's that healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confuse people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weed and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say extra wide but\nHealthcare is one of the dishes where I think instinctively\nYou ask your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your house your words like cares more about healthcare\nInstinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they may they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about them and they think Democrats raise taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know at a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and this is what we might have\nA we even have a Fox News pull recent Fox News full from just the within the last week I think they found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare a gift and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did to Africa Affordable Care act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martha ... and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend they voted for something that they did in ... you know and and using a ... other ways to try to get on this because it's a big vulnerability\n... I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk would love to talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of a color simply wouldn't get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester town Maryland Michael you're on the air\nSome Charlie due to court tent that you begin Tuesday night at\nNine O W us that\nAre going to\nChange\n[noise] support from point comes from the

elections and how much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots in two thousand Eighteen I'm doing today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering see a healthcare\nSocial welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and dealing with this whole healthcare thing for many many years and I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect I could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have done a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I have to get a you know share ministry of interior ministry a type of a contract or live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nGoing to you know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough\nTo get the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle but they still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to ah pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nLynched thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn ah this I think it's this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like ... are right that that we still\nIt it in the United states it and the people like ... are right that\nThat we still have the problem was spiraling cost and that at the CIA didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care and so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\n[noise] yeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frankly the people who had insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial there was a and your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill for Bill Carrick comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things for your policy would cover\nAnd that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ... for people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part um ads income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who's now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternatives so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was you just take away where do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller that same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare or Medicaid\nTo them these are the you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward\nIsn't it isn't the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation Ole here is should repeal replace or or preserve you know it'll be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternatives next steps\nWell we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them to simple choice either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side uh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they were all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medic I mean\nThis candidate up in Michigan a there's a list of slack and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this was a very active conversation\nThat really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans ah lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading intimate twenty twenty\nPresidential election well since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the portable CARE Act\nOr did not solve that the cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhere they say premiums your costs for families go down twenty five hundred dollars [noise] becomes almost doubled stockpiles rough copayments rough [noise]\nThey send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was in his ally the ... century you wouldn't lose your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it [noise] how\nWe haven't got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions I just heard\nSay that he favors\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions exactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I Can't do Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to on point I'd make that so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and races that they followed ... ... is the pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that for for Democrats running\nIn races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just in Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there and Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealthcare and and the preexisting condition argument front and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions in health care\nAnd it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have\nA handle the preexisting condition question are so many of them are now vowing to protect a pre existing ...\n... ... previously protection preexisting condition protections that they voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay to wrestle read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... ... we hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures quote\nNot establish rules for eligibility based on health status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but Jonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either\nUnattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions and don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about pre existing conditions as if it's just these requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that less people by the insurance it's also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of whom have\nPreexisting conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate both that or or or alter that funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion and so if you're just you know having this this this this Republican bill which by the way you know\nMajor funding for

odyssey\nInto guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio dot org and and Archie just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience at of this massive gun show\nIn in Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we can spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kinda fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your you were a you are one time father in law are uh he ended up actually buying you know at the gun chosen that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think are the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their sons\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father my buy you a twenty two rifles so you can go hunting rabbits or or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly for me which was buying me my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color they block ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in\nSelf defense as much as any other part I marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about carrying we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding what lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting of defense of shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad a gun buying firearms and a even as far back is twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was having a conversation about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yes yeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty ten twenty eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and it is I mean we have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\nI mean I guess one thing I was wondering is um ... ... just before\nA un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surge in gun sales did that ever entered the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks ah it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called\nUm [noise] at the time or a cat in sports and you can walk in there and then by any real ...\nAnd you can walk in there and then by any real caliber of handgun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus in people can't really ... firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was a in office because a lot of people still harbor the fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and does while you know\nFictitious\nWere also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong irritates them and make them mad now make you ... your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out\nAnd that's where I was trying to take this conversation or even before you know I I even thought that I might entertained becoming that good with a pistol and I we get Stein eat mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah [laughter] you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where you talk about uh the day that you got home or or ... or or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had\nHad purchased for you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am [noise] gotta lotta Oxford comma isn't it [noise] um\n[noise] that day I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open to that the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the bean who was so much trouble he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love\nFear the way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pissed on a larger than life just it could kill me or getting killed\nI open the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intrude if it was the process of removing the empty magazine putting it back and recognize slide which really that easy\nA person with a gun chance to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser site and poke smash strength which is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your lunatic\nI point the gun at the blank white bedroom wall in my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click of the trigger the soft tap the hammer and in in the chamber\nI put the gun back and it's a case knowing that next week the chamber would no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic and metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait what a weapon so lethal I Wish we could invent it\nIt's RJ young reading an ex\nI Wish we could invent it [noise] it's\nRJ young reading an excerpt of his new memoir let it being a young black man's reluctance odyssey into guns\nAre gay I you know I Wonder if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that excerpt you you showed this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands or some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey that I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism the truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun and I put a question mark at the end of that statement and wanted to find out for myself is that was true\nAnd us yen countless rounds and trips to the gun range to get good really really good like master Yoda on day go by this is how to use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it\n... yeah [laughter] yeah I did but use your heart out ...\n[laughter] but you know I mean so the thing is is that you have\nYou just you you telling them and more and you're describing to us now how [noise] you know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just owned passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of that you

young he's author of the new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctance odyssey\nInto guns or an R. J. just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association [noise] ah I I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there's multiple there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed a protection for the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about\nA African American and gun history in America\nYeah and I got to profile dug for the book you know so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nA who believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of guns were taken from people look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\nSo I'm just wondering I [noise] I\nI hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of uh African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise]\nBut ah RJ did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speech more to watch the n._r._a. should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like Doug Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nYou're going to help me man a magnet when he\nLet let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member to as you shut up\nAnd I have on a Black Panther sure it's got to ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I Want a Black Panther hats\nPanther sure Scott ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I don't want a Black Panther ... what kind of stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't going to be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed there also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not um I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go round is just that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around and just a gun in a room\nIs not bigger than any illicit you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say and that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to find out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if you shared that desire you actually felt less safe a ... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't invest something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we'd spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma\nAnd he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh his attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for four of and was reading about said hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that it's not I don't need you to tell me that people should not\nJudge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me in the way you can support me is to speak up for me in the rooms that I'm not in that I'm not allowed in that I might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got you with Charles and I could see that toward the end\nYeah [noise] well our Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation a or about this issue I should say I want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and she's founder of the brown drills project to be a group that offers\nMakeup workshops and other activities for building self esteem and African American women and girls\nAnd she also organizes firearms training classes for African American women Tiffany ... welcome to appoint\nHello hello hello

about a year\nOkay and so and before that and with guns and your family\nI'm not really a I have a grandfather from ... Georgia oh he's a hunter um so you know he had a A R o shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughter they drew granddaughters and we ...\nOld shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughters and two granddaughters and we knew that what that was but there was a trainee know interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason that took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was the new I don't want to say new but this heightened\nRacial to climate and the area that I live in um that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother or be able to protect my children\nDuring the Trump campaign and you know my children were very very um\nTuned into what was happening would have a new uh politics and they were able to feel that the tension drive as well um and they were very concerned\nAnd one and a Trump got an off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nHow what was going to happen to us people were being I'm from an okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before\nWho are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us and him being you know I have a son and a daughter and then it myself [noise] he's like well I have to protect you that and I'm like no way kid that's my job\nAnd then I thought about it like how would I really protect us\nDo do you ... Hannah I'm ... I'm Sorry I didn't I didn't mean it up there but do you really do you feel now that having a gun has made you and your families safer\n[noise] um\n[noise] I feel protected I feel that if someone crosses my threshold have something other than my fifth and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home from extracurricular activities and the seasons change and it's gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself\nAnd and make my kids safe\nYeah ah ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I I hear her and I hear the voice of someone\nWho feels that ah that the places that we usually look for protection in society\nGovernment law enforcement et cetera than our fellow citizens that there's a failure there which is why she felt like she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her and her kids\nThat perhaps a sense of society feeling us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me it feels\nI understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect their child but it feels like we've we've all we're all feeling each other if we're turning to weapons as a means means for protection\nI had this very discussion I'm with my girlfriend here recently who is in charge of a five year old and a three year old both girls\nTune in for Florida matters tonight at six thirty here on W.

Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty those are good\nQuestions uh and uh it's unclear in the constitution would Congress's role would be in getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ratified\nBy the Senate uh and uh in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump presidents in Nineteen eighty seven or ... but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty is the president's discretion in Congress has no role in that\n[noise] can you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there is a threat from Russia there's the threat from North Korea there's a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to inch closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where's is where does this it\nIt's just pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against the whole class of nuclear weapons okay\nTo me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear or treaties and nuclear threats are that are bound by trees as the nonproliferation treaty which really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons to spread\nAnd are by and large that's been pretty successful Joshua are the factors in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy\nThere would be twenty five nuclear weapon states by Nineteen Seventy okay\nToday they're about six seven and so we've done a lot better\nAbout six seven and so are we done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nAnd the ... the ... nuclear weapons was a disaster that did not and so and so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact of the treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know international relations are a little tense right now\nRight it was and certainly the weekend in record back in October eleventh and twelfth Nineteen eighty six that document in my book and thank you for mentioning it\nAh that will be turned into a movie fairly soon\nA is an exciting rollercoaster of up and down the motions up as ... up and down views in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produced the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy jog\nOr for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night\n'til six thirty the next morning\nGoing over the details of ... and I could report to the president the next morning on that check Tobar twelve Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night than we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians it was just a way a liberal weekend\nBefore we move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if by way of wrapping up our conversation I could ask you about the leaders who signed this treaty Ronald Reagan and we called Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim\nAnd I'm sure you're familiar with it too\nMuch Mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty [noise] the maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nShe asked about this issue with\nThe fat at every meeting [noise] from the meeting\nIn Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent\nAnd a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person\nOr when you think of ... a Gorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of demand the humble and this of the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with a Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this is\nProbably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or they're hard\nTo say though there will disguise Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants in his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country\nAnd his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was he was a fanatic about uh\nImmigration how wonderful was he was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense it's drying reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by the so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump's but anyway this style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Ninety six\n... author of Reagan in Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik an extra wide I work on it for a much very got back [noise]\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common according to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula no one checklist that defines all leaders\nStanley McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan for two thousand nine to twenty ten\nAnd he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason van Gogh and he joins us to discuss that General McChrystal welcome to win a it's another busier Joshua we also like to take your questions in thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to

A. M. U.\nDot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear or they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one\nAnd yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way he made me feel better I think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who is a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot\nBut typically they give alongside to us and and if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our week demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask when so many questions about our society today\nThe book there are three misfits you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through the ... one of the time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership\nThe formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and\nTheir leader can use them on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is change the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe but what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome an idea for thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded with the leaders still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader of cause the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven door so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nWhich is very common I mean if you think about it every body a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted to Baskin that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and reclaim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but reality\nThat data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others\nIt it it is something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen\nMr King Junior's probably a success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician in Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill she was extraordinarily powerful\nAnyone who works in the White House leaves with

A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nAlso have had a a quaint and ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and out in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word for it and not he floated the idea or he hinted at it's around\n... threatened yeah let's go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president was sort of like that sort of a threat but ah\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle\nYou know so for me um I Love coming on MPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews because I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said\nThat he spent a lot of time understanding the other side ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and it we can my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nAnd there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press as a communications director where you tried to convince the president to to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you've said that\nRhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be having it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press\nAnd servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the ... at the I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous some ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do is I'm a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on that list but as far as like me any more than he likes the president and all your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nShe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... directors over its him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to to the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI live in a while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well we'll wait better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star ah people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I liked seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with allegedly stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or something\nLeast all let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that immunity doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happen to them people got very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in a way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the comp seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like Mao props and him telling these\nStories that while ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm just saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over look listen I just left a morning show where these guys like\nThey they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do then is you've got to tell them straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people\nWere the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and when you get to a
