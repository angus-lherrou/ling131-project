listeners about some of their scariest songs of all time and Gemini or going back and forth with some of our selection and right now it's Jim stern\nGreg I'm going to throw another one to another dedicated listener who wrote in with a killer suggestion was so good maybe go instantly told how come I never thought of it before Shelby Peterson from Chicago said\nHard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cash to it and when she gasped out near the end that alert yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nUnits waymen need it smells real name is singing a song by ... wreck and Curt Vile from three pending opera\nIf I look at it as just a tune that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part of her coming to rescue her the black ship on the horizon and that these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the decks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe weight Nina Simone plays it nationally the civil rights activist\nShe changes a very few words and does it skillfully\nIt suddenly a southern hotel and that she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and the black ship suddenly becomes something else if it's going to become justice when societies equalize you're going to get yours\nAnd you know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed that that's what's creepy about it's a powerful tune\nA scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone unsound opinions\n[noise]\nYou can watch grabbing these\nWhile you're gone [noise]\nMaybe one seems to me and it makes you feel that way out of town in front of me on hold town but you'll never guess [noise]

Gemini ties in a really nicely with what I'm going to play next that sort of macro view of the world a sense of evil in the world looked like a fiasco address that on his song put you on game from his two thousand seven out of the cool\nConcept album about this title character and the choices he has to make in this world fraught with evil I mean look at it was coming up a really hard time and it's like when he made this album is father and a good friend had just died his longtime manager just gone to prison so he's investigating this topic of\nShe does have that's industry ... her but she even just no she likes her movies in our novels and she likes scaring people yes and why this song in particular\nIt's a great point because he's not a big fan of ... on the imagery in that song she kind of engagements off I think there's a line about hedge transcend the driver's side and there's a question how deep\nRed cells but the thing that really gets me is there's a line that says that you're so Catholics outlook an old paper bag packed and the lights in the early grades that just gives me the Willie every time it's just such a great in age\nDoes you know [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nJust as soon as search things beneath the surface of a beautiful song grab stuff mix tape you can be ...\nI think you for having me\nThat was Nico case with a deep red belt in listeners are you ... you asked a Greg I Know you're you're sure we're in a bit over there it's time now for our final scary song that you got one more each morning you got\nI'm going to play one of Bruce Springsteen's creepy a songs state trooper from his Nebraska I'm Nineteen eighty two\nI think Nebraska stands alone in his catalogue as by far the bleakest album he ever recorded most people think of Springsteen is kind of this uplifting guy finds a way to find a little kernel of hope in almost any scenario eat he sings about\nYou know the born to run elements a classic example of that he was talking about getting out of town there's this bleak existence that he's living but he's going to get out somehow\nIn Nebraska the entire album a bunch of characters who are kind of at the end of their rope and can't find a way out\nSo we inside the mind of this guy who was driving along\nBegging the state trooper not to stop them the only thing we know about this guy is that he's got no license no registration and what he says is a clear conscience about the things he's done maybe there's some contraband in the car some drugs and guns is there a body in the trunk\nYou know what I think of that scene in the Coen brothers movie in Fargo\nWere pulled over by the state trooper and suddenly things go from the tension is in the air and and then things go horribly wrong\nThis was almost a set up for that scene in that movie that is a brief snippet of a moment in the life of this character and he's about to snap in about two minutes and you can hear this little ... from Springsteen that becomes a war a few seconds later and you get the sense that yes she is\nSpringsteen that becomes more of a few seconds later and you get the sense that yes he has finally turned the corner to just completely losing his mind and going off the deep bad it's Bruce Springsteen state trooper unfounded opinions\n... no more than ... ... ... who come\nFrom a rich history of ... a good ...\n... s things [noise]\n\n...
