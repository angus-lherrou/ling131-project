[noise]\nChain [noise]\nStrange [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO Sears you worked on big little lies and sharp objects\nWas they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV male characters are the ones who are the messengers the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about Disney so you know she is listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her her precocious little\nFor mainstream audience certainly [noise] so are you kind of feeling like oh I don't care about cash as much as like your about what the song is\nSaying and how it's going to work for this for this scene or this character or the ...\nThe I always it's always worth going to convey the emotion that you want Michael ... was actually in big little lies and kind of fell apart and so that was what was such an interesting discovering was that was sort of in a scene already and then and now\nUpwards into that title but when you look at the power of what that has done for his career and Leon Bridges career just went right back up on the charts and then you've got something like that so then I thought it would come down\nRuling the\nMan\nBehind a\n\nAnd they added with someone writes it's really exciting and I also think that the power of housing market to music because it it's a motion all it isn't just you know it's really a painter he's a waiver\nYou know she uses a little bit of an here and there are so you hear that so enough to come down at the very beginning with them roller skating it's really cool but then it will keep coming around and around and and it and it features that people really feel like they have a relationship with that song by the time we get to the end of\nThe theory I think that's what to me makes a big difference about\nHow it is and it and it's always puts conveying the emotion that the director wants to convey and you know I always tell people music as a point of view are chopping supervisors is to make sure that everybody's understanding the different points of view that are possible\nAnd for someone like John market's really working backwards from where he's trying to go with the characters because he's\nBeen says how he misses him now I'm working with him about it more in the composer capacity that's just what we need to do here and we're going here and he's\nHe's very clear about the emotions of ... what he wants to do and there's no nothing is done their casually\nI Want to talk more about your work in movies you did the music for I Tanya that twenty Seventeen film but Craig Gillespie made about judge Tonya Harding controversial figure skating\nAlways time yeah [noise]\n\nThere's no such thing as truth\nThere's no such thing as ... [noise] everyone\nHas their own [noise]\nAnd he would feel restricted by the time period but you have to music from ... although I ... the soundtrack almost entirely Seventy hard rock why was that\nWell I was a film that I came in fairly late on and it was a film that had\nThat Craig had had caught his film using a lot of sorts music and those songs are tend to be really expensive but nobody wanted to be in that movie I have to tell you what are they so when I walked in the door kind of more as like\nA were hemorrhaging over here and we don't know how to shave this film and I was super busy and going oh my gosh and I looked at the movie and I thought it was really good the first thing I realized was that we have to change the narrative about what people think about Tonya Harding\nAnd to to do that and to you know try and\nSlipped out around and so she had already known that he wanted to use a lot of seventies music which was a little odd because it really doesn't have anything to do with that period that time\nThat you know Tonya Harding didn't happen in the seventies so out of whatever formed her right\nWell you stayed up but it really for ... you know that goes down to the power and music and film with that when I started to cry while the seven ... music\nAnd there was a lot of Matias already to American Hustle I Would like to know how that was already featured in American or this or that which I which I Love you know and and and David wrestle does to you know he he said you know when you influence other directors it's amazing\nAnd she was like well I you know if there's something really emotional and warm about those rock songs on the seventies [noise]\nYou're in my life [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nWe met at an ice rink where I was when you sit down and try and jump in Asia and you're right you don't have some stuff that goes with the sound of and so it really started with such a first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher and\nSo those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm and that she\nSaid that we could and have power because otherwise you wouldn't like her\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried to a couple of things and it was totally film didn't want it and it made her older so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed and I want seventies music and then we just worked really really hard to get\nWhat we wanted and to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and are being pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of tournaments getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told and you know we mark north where was so gracious because he had turned down the dire straits on Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I\nJuliette several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out spent four hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real and said I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management couldn't stand the rash and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet so I [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\n[noise] English researcher for them and that\nReally re voted no\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and then he wrote the sweetest note and said thank you isn't checkups I would've never knows that we did and she was so\nHappy to be part of that film than trying to think it's really about communication artist to artist seeing what Christ turn to do why it's important and why that music belongs there\nIs a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O.
