thousand and three that you're centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen Years of his life but\nLegacy is huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood

side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nSound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nAnd the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that oldest rush used the horn section and instead of a harmonica player in his bands but there was also an intensity\nTo the sound that was a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you've got a sense of you know people talk about the blues been kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there were protests music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gone say unique to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nHe was a you know he'd always be smiling and those album covers yeah if you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and it was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't do anything but worry that's about all I Do I worry about my damn hard times and bills\n\n\n...\nUm ... got a friend of his ... caught and our guests phase MC five tarnished\nWayne Kramer prolific solo or years\nHe's here to talk about his new memoir the hard stuff do crime the MC five and my wife

the fifties taking it in New directions with touches a free jazz and what would come to be called punk rock\nArriving at a time probably the most controversial year in American history up until recently Nineteen sixty eight the wake of riots in major American cities including Detroit hide of the Vietnam War the aftermath of the civil rights movement the Democratic national convention here in Chicago\nThe empty five never hit it big commercially as as well as expected by many people until years later when generations of musicians have since\nTaken inspiration from their work punk rock in the seventies and you know the ... or the purge editors in England Sex Pistols clash groups in the alternative ever like mud hunting your rage against the machine\nThere dozens and dozens of artist who have taken inspiration from what they did the MC five in Detroit in the sixties\nSo it's a fifty year anniversary general that debut album thoughts on the alien by take out the gyms was recorded fifty years ago this month\nThat was a you know we talk about a calling card right it was chaotic very live you've got the sense of being at that Grande Ballroom watching this band at its peak there was also a political been here as\nWell that could not be discounted the the ... the band was associated with the white panther movement their manager John Sinclair was a noted radical and self described revolutionary he wrote the liner notes for for a kick out the jams\nAnd the emcee but happily went along much to their chagrin though are the establishment didn't like it so much\nI mean the big department store in Detroit Hudson's for example wouldn't carry it because of some of the outspokenness I mean the FBI investigated the bad guy or the FBI file yeah so you know when Cramer talks about his days in the Detroit seen has struggled with drugs and alcohol addiction is time in prison\nIn his memoir and he also talks about his career as a solo artist and music composer for a film and

happy to speak to you to\nWeigh in let's start at the beginning the MC five comes together around a cast of young mayor do well and the Detroit area Fred sonic Smith on guitar with you Michael Davis on base you on guitar and vocals Dennis Thompson on drums and the great Rob Steiner as the lead vocal is\nBy what I loved about the MC five is that you guys were not polish\nSpecifically Rob Steiner he had these glasses this weird wild afro he was kind of a chubby your guy he didn't fit the mold of a rock star God like Robert Plant\nNo but he was the world's greatest rock front man gas because he looked like nobody else he sounded like nobody else and he had a a vivid clear vision of the future of\nHad a a vivid clear vision of the future of rock and and where he wanted to go with it I mean your glasses and he had a gap in his teens suddenly had this big shoulders and this little tiny waste and skinny legs and he wasn't like\nDirect from central casting that's for sure we worked hard to develop on an idea about what our band was trying to do and and what our message was and it was a message of South Africa see in self determination and that you could change the world if you did at Seoul measures\nYou know if you've kicked out the jam was totally and completely you could make something happen [noise]\n\n\nYou\nKnow when a lot of fans late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical revolutionary as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War [noise]\nSpiro Agnew was the vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new left says the band is part of the communist conspiracy to corrupt the use of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that's that's making some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar or the vice President George days what was it was the feeling within the band at that time [noise]\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they held against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not a man and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before our court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretap case led to the downfall of Richard\nNixon I basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon yet\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book of openly admitting or you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job like I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work I just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work\nNo ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I thought mattered and I didn't think that a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much\nBut the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act you know democracy is participatory it's not just a word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it and I protested with everything that I had\nAnd I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifty sexual morality\nMarijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and uh I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're right in the middle of the sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only I guess there were the number of bands were invited play\nYou were the only man that actually did play at the convention a sort of a ... as a part of the ... the the student movement that was occurring in protest of what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park\nUm what were your memories of that day in sixty eight to because of the riots started to flow downhill\nPretty much as soon as you got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events that we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there was a good vibe there was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson try sickles\n\nObviously policy shut shut down a tragedy but he went to prison anyway next year it'll be five ... uh and they've also cocaine he went for two years of Lexington federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky\nYou know some people talk about how miserable they weren't prison and it's the sense I got to reading your telling of it in the hard stuff\nIs that there were some good stuff that came out of there for you personally you know I don't know the rehabilitation has the right word or but there was some learning going on you made good use of those years that you were in prison [noise] am I reading that correctly\nWhile humans are enormously resilient and able to find value and meaning and enjoyment in the most terrible circumstances\nAnd people in Brazil do right now as we speak they have the same fears and ambitions as we do out here and in fact we're all the same ... um they made a serious mistake no doubt but um there are still just regular people\nAnd yeah I I was able to to use the time to improve my job skills took advantage of every program that they made available to me and I tried to understand what was wrong with me and what could I Do to make sure I never came back to these penitentiaries again\nMhm [noise] I mean obviously work you'd never you didn't end up in prison again\nUm well it worked ... years\nRight yeah I mean I don't believe president helps anybody number I think it may have saved my life because I was doing my worst drinking and drug in those days and the people I was hanging out with were very dangerous people\nSo it's it saved me a map sense but these are dangerous places where you're never safe or you're embarrassed jury mask elated you are powerless and here in a world of the violence racism bitterness and defeat\nAnd nobody ... better [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTell us about shelters are going through you know aids organization human they brag a ambitious idea can we bring music to these people behind bars shit what\nWe do is pretty simple we find people that work in corrections that are willing to use music as a tool for rehabilitation\nToday our instruments are in over a hundred and twenty American jails and prisons\nWhat we do and besides just supplying instruments is we operate songwriting workshop programs which are self expression programs\nUm where we can help one learn how to express complex\nAnd uncomfortable feelings in a positive way ... you know everybody has the story and everyone's story needs to be told and it's the beginning of the hard work of positive change you know most people in prison they don't like being there [laughter]\nAnd they don't want to be in prison and uh if you give them the\nTools and the incentive they will make the changes may need to make sure they don't come back to these terrible side\n[noise] [noise] you know it's\nInteresting because the politics and the arts and the music show there was a it was a huge melting pot of that in in Detroit and [noise] you know you think about back on that era is just such a collection of characters I mean between the MC five ...\nAnd what was happening in Motown which is extraordinary but then you got you know the the one who will start ... pop telling me or any any chance he got\nHow good the MC five were to him and his band they couldn't get a leg up here was these guys who were made it or we're perceived to be making it\nGiving a hand up to a ... a baby band that was trying to find his way you know aids become obviously ... I mean you should be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the band and and the rhythm that uh you pop danced with are still dances where I mean he's one of the great front men of all time um\nUh so yeah of course if when Danny Fields or\nDoes or any other bands around here like the MC five I said you know there's no more bands like the MC five which he just seemed to psychedelic\n[noise]\nAll we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise\nAnd we're all smoked the same passion we always at the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nIf you think about the characters you know coming through that again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper the time but when he when he was just a little bit later I guess a a Seeger Bob Seeger later writer all these characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we've all been it together with all known each other going back to the record ... days where we're all show up at a at a church hall where uh\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and\nAnd uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between all of a a a Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time\nIn Detroit was driving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible in\n[noise]\n\nOne of the hottest thing I've found all you have a good buddy whose name is Ted [noise]\nAnd I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place at the same time All right um but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah you know he he never had any political interest in the sixties\nAnd he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of are and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo ah to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that\nThrough his uh his hunting in outdoorsman hobby that was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I we remained friends or I could call them up today and we can have a pleasant conversation\nUm but we are not we have yet to have a real substitute political shape and Iran I I'm open to it I Would ... I'd like to fish because I Know he does a lot of good in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people\nAnd I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell an eye to one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over\nTo pick up his guitar and we see he strapped Mm you know he's got this this\nPillow in the back of his ...\nJust struck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there\n[noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
