something that's probably under the mainstream radar you probably haven't heard of it\nOr a week collect these we try to do the show every once in a while and turn you want to great music that deserves a wider audience Greg you get to go first\nJob I'm going to start off with a an exploration of garage rock one of our favorite genres ever since the sixties right every band that want it to be you know we just talked about the Beatles were there was a lot of bands cropping up all over America they'll want it to be the Beatles playing music in garages\nAre in that tradition has carried on a long and glorious history in Chicago or the last decade we've ... we've had a a ton of these really great garage rock combo so in other words these are veterans from that scene that are forming its band users are two things that make eaters stand out\nFrom the pack one is the songwriting bone Hansen in particular\nHe's writing a deeper more introspective ally ... than you would expect from the typical garage rock band me a a suicide an older brother ah has really informed a number of the lyrics on this I mean it's impossible to miss\nA that vibe that melancholy tragic vibe that that courses through a number of these songs but it's not a downer at all this is a great band\nAnd I think the or the other distinctive feature of this band is the um a keyboard smearing McCain she plays one of those visas\nMirrored yet you're of our feet or for you to play with my band I don't know why\nAnd and what I like about it is a ... does not use the uh the far fees as just sort of a little accent or that its own over driven and I need instrument in this ...\nExcept that its own over driven now need instrument in this band and some of the heavier rock or is it really blast in to the forefront the sort of I'm going to play though is is more on the contemplative side it's just got a haunting melody to it a huge you hear the the bans gift for a hooks ... as well as that sort of the\nUnderlying tone of melancholy it's something from the ban eaters unsound opinion\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd I know\nI heard on the New York and I know for for for for going on with your dog\nOr [noise] [noise] [noise] okay now let's see if we would do it why she was\nPregnant introducing a map news I mentioned I read the league we'll write about him and he's turned me onto a lot of

mammals plus you have your what what is the first treasure you're\nGoing to lay on the first one is a group from St Louis called boxing there and an ... uh about five years ago you could see them play the first four banter township exactly a a ... for those of you know in Chicago with the about the size of some tech and uh\nThey have shown tremendous growth over the course of several ... their third album or nearby God came out\nA couple of months ago and it is just enormous uh I it it feels like the world opens whenever I hear it um in particularly the the title track 'em ... a song that uh\nThe co producer or Chris Walla of formally object Capra cutie uh apparently went to the mat for is what he told the gum\nThe band was going to cut it uh and I got an angel who did on the record not even good on guard which is funny because it's a it's the title of the record and uh I saw them play and Lincoln hall a couple of weeks ago which is up slightly larger space been township [noise]\nAnd uh they introduced the song as a ditches for anyone who has worked on something creatively and felt like giving up and uh it's it's so clearly put themselves out there and that they took real rich it sounds like a pop song it sounds like a pop song from the eighties it sounds like a pop song\nThat is very much of this moment as well um\nThere's very little hint of of contemporary you mow of two thousand emails and it was the emotion revival yeah young yet although yet or what I like to a group called the fourth wave you know [laughter] I I Love it because they took such great

do\nI think a lot of people who aren't ultra familiar with the recording studio you know they won't surge George Martin was the Beatles producer right but that's like the director of a movie whereas the recording engineer is doing all the technical work it's like a hammer man without a great camera person you don't have a great movie no matter how great the director is he\nWas the technician who ran the machines and made sure everything got on tape\nBy the time the Beatles recorded robocalls her in April Nineteen sixty six he promoted do a full engineer you know and now he's white you know Eighteen Nineteen\nAnd he worked with them on Sargent peppers lonely hearts club band ah basically everything else throughout your career then went on to work with them some more uh at apple studios
