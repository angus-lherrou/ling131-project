endorsement in the governor's race here brings to focus to a health care and then Republicans in Florida also in the race while the Republicans were going after the opponent the Democrat over

it's at Florida round up all of that ahead but first this hour we spoke recently with Tallahassee mayor and Democrat Andrew Gillum about his campaign for Florida governor take a listen\nMayor Dylan thanks so much for being with us we'd like to begin by asking you about your environmental platform where campaigning at that the red tide that's been circling\nThe state or the other day and see is the key and you're calling for a plan that\nUh codes for everything from funding septic as Stewart conversion pro grandstanding fracking to transitioning to renewable energy\nA these are a progressive positions that you stake out and you've called your opponent Ron dissent is an election year environmentalist how does your plan on\nAddressing environmental issues really differ from a Mr ... sentences are given that he he's actually supporting a lot of the same position you are\n... with the exception that actually have a history on trying to get some of these things done we've upgraded significantly uh our sewer system in Tallahassee\nA during my time on the commission and as a mayor or the same week that Donald Trump broke ground on a one on whether the the thing we keep all of the Paris accord\nAnd my city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acres solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produced a we've also adopted a unanimous resolution and are a community our city hall or to move toward one hundred percent renewable\nAbout twenty thirty five um so the difference is that in this election year we now are hearing from missed advantages on his proposed\nA plants um and what we're talking about is not just where we're trying to go but also where we had been at the community and what we've actually done a lot of voters will have to make the choice of whether or not you trust me on these issues\nOr you trust the person who was taking a huge sums of money from some of the biggest polluting industries in the state of Florida\nOr when it comes down to it I think voters will have to have that\nAre between myself and him not just the planes that we put on paper but what we've done to advance a more clean and renewable future\nHow do you plan to go forward between now and election day to turn out not only base democratic voters but how how do you plan to win over independent voters who like a lot of what you're saying on the campaign trail but might be undecided and might have concerns about the cost of some of your position\nWell I'll tell you if you were in everyday working person in this state or the choice should be completely clear ah between myself and Ron disadvantages that given my background and experience and the issues that we're leaning into in this race\nOr that we're working hard to make the lives of everyday Floridians better um I have said all along I'm going to campaign in every part of the state of Florida are you mentioned Polack uh we went down to palm coast we've been to the villages the most conservative voting area of the state\nI'm all throughout the panhandle uh all over the wall county or a\nOr were you all are or were campaigning everywhere because when you're governor other state of Florida you got to be the governor for all of the state of Florida and we can't leave any of these votes um ah to to be taken for granted I mean not windy conservative counties but we got to lose them less I'm\nAlso going to campaign and some of the more urban areas of the state because they want to know that we feed them and we hear them and that we have a plan to improve their lives conditions as well\nUm it's my belief that that that adds a a the the candidate right now on the Democratic side campaigning for governor we have got to stop treating the state of Florida like at the electoral college we don't win one county lose another pick up one in losing out of the one who wins the one who gets one more vote\nAnd it my job to get out there and try to let people know who I Am\nA let them know that they don't need to buy into the caricatures of me\nI Fifteen Years of public policy making experience and I've lived in a very pragmatic way\nOn the leader of a of a community at right now is the fastest growing economy in the state of Florida per capita Seventeen fast growing in the nation per capita we want a tech higher designation during the Obama administration for the work that we're doing to retrain workers ON Technology related jobs that exist today\nI'm committed to that not just in the community where I live now but state of Florida and I want Florida voters to know

physician is to support building\nA reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee that would filter the water and habits slowly go into the Everglades this is something that's been talked about for decades and he specifically said because of his washing the connections as a as a congressman he would help push the um the the federal government to to build that\nUh didn't address the cause of it and why this was happening but this is kind of more of a a a solution to the problem it's hitting both coasts\nAnd are you briefly touched on red tide or after the meeting after is a is a speech yesterday he was talking to a bunch of reporters and uh he mentioned that his first trip would be to go to Israel to investigate this now that's not a a man that is something that a lot of\nA lot of Republicans say to shore up their evangelical base right um and he said he was going there to investigate ways of battling red tide um I haven't heard anything come out of there but um you know more power to if you actually find a solution there\nRight at all so he attacked his opponent mayor killings record in Tallahassee particularly that cities crime rate but after a rocky start that the Senate campaign seems

strategists\nWe listen to that long interview off the top of the hour with Andrew Gillum speaking as a Republican strategist watching his campaign which has generated a lot of enthusiasm and excitement around the state what are your thoughts about feelings positions\nAre in terms of how progressive they are are they a bridge too far or not for moderate an independent voters in this state\nWhile I'm On a farm to of from two thousand feet to maybe twenty five thousand feet I think that this is um the most interesting\nGubernatorial election in my memory including the ones that I was directly involved in I'm going to submit that it is a an echo in a weird way of two thousand sixteen presidential race you have a\nUm you know Donald Trump in a multi candidate field or won the nomination by the being the most extreme guy in the race she was the bomb throwing a kind of class she was going to drain the swamp\n[noise] um he was on like\nPrevious Republican nominees were the criticism from the right advantage that they weren't extreme enough and damned if you didn't win in this particular governor's race that rules occupied by the Democrat by kill him he is um\nThe interview emerged from a multi candidate field ... having the most extreme positions generating the same kind of passion and enthusiasm and oddly enough Rhonda strangers has the Hillary Clinton role he is the\nAccording to the league of conservation voters and every year they produce a score card\nFarley positive and negative both on environmental a bill mhm dining out late into Iran be fantastic voted against the environment Ninety eight percent of the time during his\nIn office as a fact US Congressman y tells alive summarizes at all are back for a common front yeah jazz like the plane in South grain allow that we believe it\nThe way that will be up to Florida voters let me remind folks that you are listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nMac I heard you giggle at that uh environmental a rating record there are by congressman dissent is uh is he running away from that record as he was trying to become a bit of a dream candidate a and not take sugar money for instance in the uh run for the governor's office\nWell nobody in this race is I'm taking money from um\nAgribusiness uh this year which is again a departure in ... and kind of interesting I don't know much about the census is record or on the environment in Congress\nBut you cannot say that he did not come out of the shoot like a bull I'm On Everglades restoration and the lake and those sorts of things to somewhat to migrate discomfort I might add\nI'm so\nAgain and I'm being down there for which I Apologize I'm they're fighting over preeminence on this issue and I think that probably\nOver ... minutes on this issue and I think that probably the outsider um the comic clashed would have the edge at the end of the day over the uh status you know standard bearer the status quo\nAnd Fernando lots of tweets coming into the Florida round up here's one for you or he has to show what will\nPeople do to win back the Republican women who identified with Gwen Graham and might have been further embolden to vote for her after Kevin ... will now set out or worst vote for your opponent I think that's a tweet intended for Andrew gallon your thoughts\nYou know indeed and and clearly women are going to play a very important role and we see it all around the country not just women candidates running across Florida women activism as well but it's part of the calculation that a lot of people wonder if Andrew Gillum made the right choice when his lieutenant governor picky he was ... he was considering a couple of\nA female legislators one was Lauren Book here in South Florida another one a Hispanic woman in your own into area but I think fundamentally\nTo the extent that there are concerns right now and how the women's vote she's a partisan divide\nThe polls suggest overwhelmingly they are siding with the Democratic candidate so I think a Andrew Gillum is probably going to be the beneficiary of the or whatever female Republican Straggler voters there are there may be wanting to hold their nose and for the first time in a long time not vote their party\nOr the yeah go ahead and I know I was just going to say I'm\nThe women's vote is obviously going to be critical in this election is will independence I mean I think it'll be close enough at almost any large demographic showed could make the difference but ah I didn't understand the Chris King pick frankly um [noise] it may be that there was just no um [noise]\n... no relationship between when in a ... up again in the interest of full disclosure I'm she's the godmother of my dog maybe also should have picked her\n[laughter] oh my goodness [laughter] this is what happens when you put someone who's been working at around Tallahassee are decade our parents smoke that well [laughter] [laughter] okay uh we're\nQuickly to both the before we go on and Mr Trump President Trump not expected to campaign with run to the Senate later this month when early voting begins in Florida at the Trump factor in this race yet or not\nI I think Donald Trump is about as popular in Florida and the guacamole algae soup is intoxicating many the lakes and in fact I think Donald Trump has become toxic toxic if you don't believe me\nJust ask every Republican House candidates in congressional candidates furiously turning down every uh invitation of President Trump to come down to campaign with them we just saw that happen again in the last couple of days and even Ron descent as it was reported a said thanks but no thanks\nTo the president for a public rally but yes to a fundraiser so I think he's going to be the X factor here\nMore on

Senate speed skill um is he going to give Rick Scott the booze teeny ... it's fascinating\nTo watch them play out in parallel track your thought\nIt is indeed and you know Bill Nelson was doing a spike the football touchdown dancers the night that the Andrew Gillum got across the finish line because\nHe knows that that's going to energize a lot of Democrats and especially African American voters are let's face it Bill Nelson has never in his political life faced an opponent like this one and Rick Scott\nWho a Mac I Will surely tell you and he's heard the stories like I have Rick Scott right now is in a room uh Terminator style looking at sixty seven charts and polls and saying how much do I need to spend a win by one percentage point and he will spend every last accent of that million plus or dollars willing to do so\nHaving said that it's ironic because everybody talks about the hotel effect\nIf there is going to be a coat tail effect of bill a Bill Nelson is going to hope you've got to be from the bottom up because the governor's races which released three blocks after the Senate race\nBecause the governor's races literally three ... after the Senate race and the congressional races here so it's going to be interesting to see how that plays um but right now are not nearly as much breathing room for Bill Nelson as Andrew Gillum suggest to be having when you compare the polls\nMac yeah I um\nI Would basically agree with that the best thing to happen to a\nBill in his ... campaign for reelection ... nomination he provides the the passion and the excitement

... you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the difference is\nWell I Love to build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new protein\nHaving your bills that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] you know it's it's really amazing it's changed so much and the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type at a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\n[laughter] you say in that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what what does that mean to you [noise]\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what hard it's composing it you think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution we don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edit it\nBut we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology\nMolecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules and codes the the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean in ... when you say are the directed evolution\nOf something what is that process me\nIt's just like breathing it we've been breeding cats and dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can\nSynthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct to the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step [noise]\nYou put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day in day then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes than I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with which one\nDecide who is better than what I started with which one of those microbes makes it better protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life and that so it was a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools to biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells\nBut you do you need the cell to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have this delve there's now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you eventually see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTherapeutic agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives\nFrom renewable resources without producing excess weight just\n... I saw on you talked to said I have fun for swing molecules to have sex\nWith Oh yes I Do [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you we combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dieting coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine\nA gun and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering\nMy son who is about two and a half years old what I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your\nThoughts on the subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry of science physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nI was lucky my father was the nuclear physicist\nAnd he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys could so he never discourage me\nAnd I also had four brothers to compete with and I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from some of these scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model a mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who talents\nThis call is there any way to identify any young age who talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage them one ...\nHave a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\n[laughter] I Wish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs there's so many interesting behaviors\nOr they can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details that are as we sequence more things and under and measure their properties will be using in Portland and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out in to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nYou intend to pay that my my last question and that is are there what tool would you like to see I mean I can be well you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you if that don't exist would you like to have [noise]\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\nA powerful enough to to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use a and machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving now we know mark Abrams pretty good so I think we can put a a you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\nSaturday and weekend edition twists and turns at the Supreme Court soccer and what it means come November when Americans cash their balance\nAlso are Tom Bowman in Raqqa Syria the story of a veteran trying to find this pinch when I decided I was gonna so capable with that ... and I was like something to do right now and I literally ... ships my head edition Saturday from NPR News\nI'm our morning from eight to ten here on W. USF\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious dues individually political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues they get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those the vines or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey ... neighbor\n[noise] hey hey there you go ahead so odd\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know out as\nA black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way um women or being a man who contributes suicide you fix systems knowingly\nWasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as I mean that's um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system so\nI'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing at him and that's\nAnd identify myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about that\nThat's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening that he's you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we others see yes\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is that we often spend two long trying to defend our end points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view\nAnd we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the cool that experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the ... own experiences so in a way I think the logical you very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will\nIt's as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that to somebody else is an artist experience\nI have a tweet from James which has to me logical discussions do require map it requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect the view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way pauses math\nAnd these things have poorest boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deep steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about from from the current events or which turn out to the artist topic in current events and not as voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault the good and it's a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical processors at places tell me what you mean by that\nWell that's a whole other on a whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that just about whether you can be imprisoned for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to bring him someone innocence until that until that proved guilty\nAt the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused but let's just say that you did it a woman and the acute person is a man then what about the fact that we should also performed a woman to be innocent until she had proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and Salafi have studied ... for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and build the logical will run out and then we look at that wealth and go what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accuse people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can can happen adults happened on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept that so many people are getting away with sexual assault or are we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nWe'll be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation um would be when somebody an innocence but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but didn't prove to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWith prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault all the time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next problem is a a question of black and white thinking\nAnd this happened to look wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite position instead of something more moderate in between I'm so there is a an argument's around saying\nSomething like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor along but set on his book that that we are ... rising just spin the both will crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw puffing arguments\nWhere you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare while using every one of the rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking 'em\nTo finally um that's the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind\nAnd the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very sure that they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court\nAppointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good an important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening where in the case of a trial", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh
