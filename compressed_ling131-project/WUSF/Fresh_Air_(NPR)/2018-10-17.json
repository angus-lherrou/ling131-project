Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose a plate and it's caused by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie roads that and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I had been friends with her since high school\nOh jak isn't such despair afterwards and feel responsible he's driving any closer says eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the real\nWell let's say it's so lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt of the possible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port in ... but maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed in despairing that he's willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the currency then five which he wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue bow jak mother has died she was never a nice mother she was only as a means to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium Adam like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of his eulogy and this is well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they want it said something to learn for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town\nShe was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be the Libya's life you're getting it of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted anyway that we're supposed to want to\nBe careful moms have a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced because they're ... Olivia gone for good and of course because it's a TV\nCliffhanger ... Olivia gone for good and of course because it's a TV show should knock on for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr team out to the castle stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on this show it shouldn't have happy ... not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in a round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more show\nI guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't here looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early in that clip\nThat um he envied our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is ... or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least some really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the leaf or you can watch\nSure but we forgive you were words as presented on the show are awards that celebrities get when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgiving recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about house additives that our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted a satirized bad and then over the course of the last year it started to feel\nAnd we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we're forgive me I don't know maybe this is sadly relevance a new\nUm so I feel like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again\nWell uh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not\nYou know Louis C K uh did a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation uh their reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about those backwards and it I found a tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ...

S. um tell us a little bit about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother on to a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school\nUm you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews could never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were shipped\n'em and we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah just as happy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys and um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff was there a disconnect\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that we can majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know how did you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and an anti Semitism is unfortunately still want to see them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that now you\nSaid at 'cause if you look at and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you were diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember from middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes\nYou know I I can always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit and appropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here watching the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In\nOh this will be a funny thing and then I was mystified that\nOh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class divide a funny joke I Would say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and save this funny thing\nAnd when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the different than being you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is to me like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable elected you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there's so many pop culture references and blow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nSaid made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah we'll cheaply made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation\nThere definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this team that I was living in\nFeel like the scene that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer\nAnd having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment for if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting another story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central and his running bulge applicant Netflix theories none of Comedy Central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episode down to you know add commercial breaks\nAnd making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or what this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes\nOr would this work without those moments and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also saying look this is the show and it has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that folks will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are\nFlaws with it they will see those flaws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWell it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\n...

Blacksburg welcoming the fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nOr were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who was such a mess and all of our Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... ... ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he\nOh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it is interesting now to to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed so\nHow did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and haven't beat the washed up star of the family sitcom\n[noise] well the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I'd have been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nOh jak isn't such despair afterwards and feel responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's so lazy suicide attempt right at the suicide of jumping the plausible deniability like he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and spoke maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed in despairing that he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively\nThat he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote it I'm an unusual episode because it's one lung monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and bow jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium Adam like her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both Maine to bow jak [noise]\nI I I Want to play a three part of his eulogy and just as well or not as Beau jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around seriously they'll hold your applause\nWell held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network has a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to fight or if it's sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they want it they had something to launch for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Libya's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was being Olivia's life again and of course\nShe's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that we're supposed to want to be careful moms have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her\nThe network really juiced\nBecause their views or Libya gone for good records because it's a TV show smack on for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha ... stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do is just not handled Libya on the show you can't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn athlete saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that [noise] um so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early and that clip\nThat um he indeed our our fence because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself\nAnd I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of you know what do we\nDid in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era dean ... or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurt so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I'd reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least or a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe ... that we watch\nBut we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how the additives that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me I don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new\nI'm sort of feel like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again\nWell uh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nBut it still feels like we are not you know Louis C K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bull jak horsemen after a break\nI would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother on to a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school\nUm you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah just as\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys go um it it's just so very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Semitism and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who you know as a jury or the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey said it because there's the ... and like I think yeah\nPeople who believe that they said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah\nAnd I and I would say a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around them\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loved making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was actually inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize with inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit and appropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this will be a funny thing and then I was mystified\nThat oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect to this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's\nA ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a tension has been a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least um well I don't necessarily know the different than the you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is to me like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of\nWhat you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references and blow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them um that made me think like you must have\nSo you can barely like catch some of them um it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah we'll cheesy made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation\nThere definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing\nEven if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this theme that I was living in\nFeel like the scene that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down\nAnd say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment for if I think of a funny situation you know or wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give it away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it on a story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central and is running bow jak witches and Netflix series now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] and cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episode down to you know add commercial breaks\nAnd making under the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for ... one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nUm but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\n...
