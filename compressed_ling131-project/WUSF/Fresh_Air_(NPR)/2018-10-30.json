I Want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy show so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd

Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and kept me money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then uh I had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I and I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nWhen I really thought about it I was like wow\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense [noise]\nAnd I am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I'd have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols are buried lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he was approached by Donny Adolf played by

S P dot edu\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and little for Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you\nBe willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten now I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho was who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because at the nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael Sallah OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mine I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLike Louis Diane Keaton like why are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\n[noise] were when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because [noise]\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so\nI Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so lenient you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminar movie in my life kid is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kid is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it [noise]\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder of a film can win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you that it's done for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and\nI think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nGuess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break and marine card and we'll review a new book about and\nWe'll talk more after a break and Marie encouraging will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in

MORNING EDITION of your one person telling a story from the other side of the world are from a neighborhood near you and that voice brings you understand the new\nYeah and and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years\nInstead of playing more dramatic roles you know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball\nHow did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me just part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love that um was great experience with John ... she told me [noise]\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then uh I had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I and I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we hear a\nScene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting [noise]\nUm so you start the scene [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLess ... less than\nThey do for them to\nAnd I think we live in a building [noise]\nTwelve food yeah well for your for for for real periods where I was [laughter] or you do [noise]\nFor work or a stockbroker\nGerms runs her own good for you [noise] so right [noise] there's a lot of money [noise]\nYou know do a rest for myself I'm trying to put it together for my car in the same build on just I'm not\nUnderstand how how much money [noise]\nOn those Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious there's an unfair to almost one [noise]\nFor told you so many thousands of technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\nWhat shall we start for Seventy two thousand dollars on it I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nNot going to find a reason I quit\nAnd he quit his job and all of them was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets officers as a business or well the thing the bottom to like phosphorus than white tea party if I got to be with your wife back to the war torn rooms with Cleveland is just to look more walks\n[laughter] okay so that's the theme of Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\nJust honestly so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge your characters to just show their behavior\nAs people and the characters and his films often\nDo really ugly things and you still find humanity in there and I like how unabashedly and unapologetically she shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do in your new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to me in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and\nSomething that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean we're kind of unions are terrible father yet right ... ... can be viewed radio show in every loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's a sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nAt a Benny hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate you want to be drawn rover\nI Know in front of me that you and your and beyond the drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria and stalked Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe could not want to train whistle every once in a while for [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was shocked and in light of the name check you on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous here at this moment\nIs just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR it's incredibly boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something\n[noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Andy Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and a bill Hader told a story about a go into a Benny haunt in his home town\nAnd there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh you should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\n[noise] well ... thank you so much for coming on the show it's just been great to talk with you thank you to\nJonah Hill wrote and directed the
