trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump and millionaire by the time Donald was eight over the years Donald received today's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son\nHis father's business as much of this money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my gas or outright fraud\nSuzanne crab and David Barstow are two of the reporters that the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump device to pass his vast fortunes onto his children\nIs an crank writes about the intersection of politics money and government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes in\nResponse to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the fact upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nThey needed a president and his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSo then crack David Barstow congratulations on his extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here get a sense of Frank from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak [noise] for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York's history Judy was the guy who has a built in sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what you specialized and was building middle class housing um whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens for coming is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the [noise]\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh in so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties\nAnd especially with the return of the jeers from one or two and she would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to build middle class housing and so at his peak this is a guy who\nTo win win the presidency and so this story\nReally by sex about narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and there's an actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne crack and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on\nOur President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engagements aspect tax schemes as he reached

New York times reporter sedan crack and David Barstow two or three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in ... tax schemes as he reads the riches\nFrom his father and a key constructs the whole Donald Trump mess about how as a self made\nMillionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and another step siblings and how it came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time it was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nUm ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nUh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars of credits two hundred and forty million dollars in loans um which is on top of this\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to what we what we also saw I think what is important also was the head in many cases um these were loans that were never really paid you know he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to dad and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks on a million dollars it was just like a monthly run into to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from God and then off being off to the race\nIs were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his adventures he how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis adventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several\nSeveral bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and the the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to ... these very crucial times for more support\nTo me get a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire\nAnd end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ... on investment\nIt also see that when his cell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump said you know was there to catch them\nOnes picked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump's had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money\nThat's Being American dollars worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino chips and it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see in Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and knew well and the Scottish filter the wheel it's taken to fry Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nIn fact Trump immediately sees this calling us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of its empire and potentially put at risk and ... immediately sense now he freaks out and he makes the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald lift assault executor fried Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him\nThe depths of Donald Trump's financial life after all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of read Trump's life were toward the end of Fred Trump's life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred from Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is good for Trump perceived to this is an attempt to bring some to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe the the umpire for Trump doggedly impatient rebuild over many directors age to use that as far as I'm potentially collateral to hope that old Donald Trump or his own financial difficulties\nI guess or

progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne crack and David Barstow who along with rescue near published a long investigative article this month about ... schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death wider Donald Trump make that decision [noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it on I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump die they would hand out ... you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months\nYou know ... buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check and then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to develop for in New York for almost all of that and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds assumes that the the uh buildings that were selling those buildings ... own at this time of his death last include all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through\nThat dot sale price was was roughly just under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the stale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so if the family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that sort of it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the little valuations placed on buildings you made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from a million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is because you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a recession and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families too you know wealthy family as you are the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping whom gauge in these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more that the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just going to state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art on the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public I'm thinking which\nOne to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David [noise] or the comeback [laughter] go for it\nOr was he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino costs\nPulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and why are we\nGonna go shaving your skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this both so happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tracks schemes that we describe in the store it sort of this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a\nComeback I'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice than the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money that happened in\nTwo thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as they're there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea\nThat ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've\nReset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we were and how documented it was\nAnd the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up\nI think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for this to sort of you know people for people to digest it and\nAnd um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times says basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got accepted into or locked up in this room um who cleaned it allowed\n[laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody that's I did come in one day with a with a little documents and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy but a little writes in their ... and it'll cost phobic Shiite imagine [laughter] and other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors new but I think there was uh\n[noise] um actually people knew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody ... you know they keep people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we we tried to keep a lid on it as best we

Saturday morning at ten on your NPR\nStation\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross Donald Trump's book the art of the deal his TV show The Apprentice and he successful presidential campaign were based on his image as a brilliant dealmaker and self made billionaire but recent New York times reporting reveals a different narrative it's\nBased on a trove of more than a hundred thousand pages of documents including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald with eight over the years Donald received today it's equivalent of four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's business as\nMuch of his money was transferred from father to son with the help of schemes designed to avoid paying taxes some of which according to my gas or outright fraud\nSuzanne crab and David Barstow or two of the reporters at the New York times who wrote a long investigative article about the many tax maneuvers Fred Trump devised to passes vast fortunes onto his children\nDoes and crack writes about the intersection of politics money in government for the times David Barstow has won three Pulitzer Prizes\nIn response to their reporting a lawyer for President Trump provided a written statement saying quote there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times bases it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate unquote\nBut neither the president or his lawyers disputed any of the specifics in the times financial reporting\nSuzanne crack David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here get a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak [noise] for\nTrump was a remarkable builder and in New York the strategy was the guy who build and sold his first home before you reach the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes here by the time he was in his mid forties she was really one of the biggest\nDevelopers are treated in the country and what you specialize them was building middle class how does one whose homes which she built in his apartment buildings which we built him almost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of news\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens for community is no frills\nHomes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies but began to build in the thirties and forties\nAnd especially with the return of the GIs from World war two and she would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap federal loans to build middle class housing and so at his peak this was a guy who\nTo win win the presidency and said this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts hum and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative of the forty for president\nWell let me re introduce you to hear if you're just joining us make gas I see it in ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's\nInherited money from his father the loans you got from his father and tax evasion schemes that family had and that was published\nThe tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reached riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\nI'm arcades thanks so much for joining us like lay it back from a news now gives us a twenty percent chance of rain tomorrow we'll have a high of Ninety One at the Poynter Institute auditors NBC nightly news anchor Lester Holt and former New York times publisher Arthur Sulzberger junior at their annual Gallup the boats eyeball\nThat's coming up December eighth tickets are available right now at Poynter dot org slash bow tie\nThis is doubled us after eighty nine point seven\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter Suzanne crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a\nDonald Trump engaged in ... tax schemes and he reads the riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money ... Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager [noise]\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million I'm In today's dollars a call it's two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also was the head in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks on a million dollars it was just like a monthly run two two for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of regard him as early twenties getting a million dollars from God and then off being off to the race\nIs were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father yeah he\nUse the money for many of its ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got for for a Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several\nBankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this was the time he not only the bags hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to this fall\nHundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to bother these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from its own investments\nBut also see that when his so you know when he would fall down on the stretching it was there for Trump said you know was there to catch him\nThere's one ... just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is the time\nAnd the you know the background of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy and Fred Trump's had been there for him\nAt every turn according to the documents we can see huge assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd for a Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money\nDisappearing million dollars' worth of it was not a chat room and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see and Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well\nAnd it was caught us all to the will is taken to Fred Trump's hosts in December Nineteen Ninety\nInfrared Trump immediately sees the Scottish saw as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately since no freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family and what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred from Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt by his um to gain complete control over his state and potentially to use just the umpire for Trump doggedly\nAnd patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess in New York Times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crack after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to his children I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air

Buettner published a long investigative article this month but have Fred from youth schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise] so the\nInteresting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that for a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would\nKeep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nYou saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know pro Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assembled a private sail\nTo the dollar per in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo soon as the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings had ... own at this time of his death I don't get it off to include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included boasts of buildings that had been transferred down the one city owned it was it was pretty much ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through\nThat thought sale price was was roughly just under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that thought empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't just the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it it's true that are us actually did perform some audience when some of the tax returns that were describing the story I mean for the or else\nThe tax returns that we describe in the story I mean in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations placed on buildings who made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning it to them for a million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract\nA few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that Autor but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families should hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who can gauge\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art or the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books are the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David out of the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nOh well so he publishes the or the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this both\nSo happens to coincide with the time when they actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly when the moment when he was just taken\nPossession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of the\nComeback I'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might not happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from fat trap and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene from Trump belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering how\nYou feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the math of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward and that it's interesting when I\nTrump is still putting forward the math\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of [noise]\nI go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked and I think that we've\nReset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the\nThe power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was\nAnd the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves [noise] um but I think it will take time for this to sort of you know\nPeople for people to digest it and and um I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times that was basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access and you were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who was allowed\nTo go you know [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody that's I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] out of it but we uh yeah it\nWas just the three of us for a year um\nWith a yeah it's a pretty messy for a little ... and it'll cost her phobic Shiite imagine [laughter] than other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people\nKnew our our editors do but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it seems and Craig David ... thank you so much You're welcome thank you thank you\nSo then ... and David Barstow reporters for the New York times article reported with Russ
