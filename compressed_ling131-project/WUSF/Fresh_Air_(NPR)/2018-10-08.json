after the publication of a book of his poems and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the plane so I thought it

equal but I Want to march with you or just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's bring to when it's over unless strength to one way to meet\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become the style jacks ... because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate him things whereas this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in

brothers and many others\nTickets are at Clearwater jets dot com\nIs fresh air and if you're just joining at my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard Cohen final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the frame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to\nUm to consult the work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father staying and songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but I think it was just like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and a trans than than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter angle\nThrough his voice it's complicated quality of whatever pain or English and spirituality expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you said\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there's so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth Adams and his work had a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I go and they want to get on the record [laughter] say no and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this was a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many on millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and or an exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly coming to this book in absorbing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my meter now with my voice\nWell since you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to find out I'm not being kicked kicked cantankerous or intransigent\nI'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with us from the interview that we recorded in the thousands that\nEnded up home called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me even though I could barely cardio June\nFor many years I was known as a month\nI shaved my head in war robes and got up very early I hated everyone but I actor generously and no one found me out\nMy reputation as a ladies' man was a joke it caused me to laugh bitterly through the ten thousand nights I spent a loan\nFrom a third

of winter I Am neither the mind the intellect\nI knew the mind the intellect nor the silent voice that's also castles\nAnd now the gentle reader in what name whose name do you come to either do with me in these luxurious twinkling realms of him loose privacy\nI think that home Adam gets a little but we were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone and has ... entering his solitude yeah as\nYou noted also kind of of humor you know half of the river a loved one of those lines where he said a few so good to love you could did it's like the tour away my blindfold and said we're going to let this prisoner live [laughter] put those hilarious\nMy guest is Adam Cohen he's written a forward to a new collection of previously unpublished

Nineteen Seventy to some of your father's most famous sons are already written in recorded by the time you were born Sudan selling Maryanne\nRecorded by the time you were born in ban selling Marianne here that is no way to say goodbye burnt a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear what he did he didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you're growing up I mean like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the gun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a songwriter he must have had an awareness that Don riding much crafted something people actually did and you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking at it into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] and you grow older and then you then you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for counsel I said dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and uh was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't ever stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he was scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSandwich or move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents decorated [noise] home five six from the don't remember how much did you get to see her father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWho was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and\nNot just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims and ah my father would often even part good care of and I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home\n[noise] oh yeah the ... what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of\n[noise] oh yeah the like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm okay yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a\nLong dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things are put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow long did I Do that for\nWell he did that and variations of that through my own entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this week which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was president in our lives was ... feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um he's reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain your father savings\nAnd sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing so I'll just tell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm an incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work and with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold\nFrom this economic crisis arose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and the other two you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they'd never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank goodness for

is no way to say goodbye burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so did you hear them all you do if you didn't meet me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat's the sun and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the ... and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] and you grow older than you than you sort of see I remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and not scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner Will Shortz\nDo you I got to pick your brain when we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and uh was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said in his scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he said yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um when the love I'd always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated\nUm five six from the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um\nI my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd uh my father being would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nHe'd always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nSo I guess ... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the ... what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm okay yeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things they put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow long did that for\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then in in its own way as may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for\nUm he's reconnection to people [noise] um I ... around the world and that that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father's savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing insult to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened\n[noise] um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible [laughter]\nThat do the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence makes the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold\nFrom this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected in\nFestive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\n[noise] the amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being
