D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that would sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule or simulate into San so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the sweat you see on screen will be revealed a shaky will be real even with some of the terrible the real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are and that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he's really experiencing all of the ah discovery and Haitian and just physical jostling um all of that\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave's got you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the heart and question [laughter] not not\nThat I Know of we uh we did need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone\nTo someone so we had to uh ... what did we ain't getting jostled from where we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or cause riots that type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ...\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space capsule at least it wasn't and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [noise]\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities with putting space in film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean\nA sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon fright\nMassive puts together a press state and about the death of the man on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n'em and tell you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they download NASA's preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and uh what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a\nAnd so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a given Heinz who plays ... in the movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech and says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time it's incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know\n[noise] you know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about New York and and his colleagues is just how close to death they uh\nLived their lives and being willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed the new film first men and wrote and directed la

entirely instead of choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what games self would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he spent time alone\nAway from any cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those were the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase do not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was the product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to

no\n[noise]\n\nNo no\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the weight of the moon and in ... in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of directed la la la land and where did you and also wrote and directed whiplash\nOn and they found remarkable was that you were working on my land before first man but a lot of them was a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a a you know I've been\nTrying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book or a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nI fell in love with that and and and winter Ryan and said hey would you be interested in play Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musical study I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about you Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as allowing was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into that\nSo I'm finally what GMOs joined the most anxiety and during a movie like first man which they so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nRent again the real science Jeanette miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know ... but that's because of like crazy I see in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nI mean I think everything you describe gave me a lot of the things I Do a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that\nA ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of that and and helping us get it right or but knowing that at the end of the day or this was a film that they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further\nSort of like a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder

the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself\nWhen you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know ... it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region mansions are incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar seem addict terrain at least to uh\nTo whip lash in la la land and and ah but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like

that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking said that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary in Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second that's happened to a Neal and ... you know uh [laughter] uh we uh ride and I both wanted to try and make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody trail up to the heart and question [laughter] not not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because ah he started to uh uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from where we\nHad to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second uh cause writes the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the New Orleans I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space and being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule at least it left him and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for teams like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space\nUm injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know ah this is a hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of a uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of would augment the downs you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future [laughter] you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm I'm almost\nHigher and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the feeling is right before the moon flight\nMasha put together a press state meant about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and kill you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping they landed on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release urology um didn't get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know ... you can search it online in a band of moving disaster um and uh what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a until the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGiven Heinz who plays ... the whole date is is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love to have that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of but um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech and says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was writing has obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues is just how close to death they\nA live their lives and in seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes a half to ... or any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nAgainst his ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break and light trucks will review a new set of ... recordings of

choice entirely instead of choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon ah during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to spend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about\nSo what he himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his own sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching those\nUm those were the things I think there were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Jamie inches out he directed the new movie first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a break this is fresh air\nThan\nThis

get back to my interview with Damien ... he wrote and directed la la land and whiplash and directed the new movie the first man starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you refer and yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah that guy you know it's\n... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices that Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it\nIt's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience I was like being a fleet of the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nVersion of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned that you may have to book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous track the music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know a guy who was a having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly no one in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of time or to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nWhy don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] oh [noise]\nUh uh uh\n[noise]\n\n\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the weight of the moon and in ... in the new movie first manned missions directed by ... now lots of direct did a lot of land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I have found remarkable was that you were working on our land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like it hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man uh and uh so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise] I've been\nTrying to get a made for a while and with no success in and uh ...\nBeen trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during or after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way also here a year into musicals you have the musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\n[noise] so I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which they so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicas and real side and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know raw land was a complex film but that's kind of like the choreography and the camera work and that dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I'm In uh uh I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing that I'm\nA ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were ah going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get a ride and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned bell thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations\nOn you so nice to be back thanks for having me\nDamien ... directed the new movie first man and win an Oscar for directing la la land after a break
