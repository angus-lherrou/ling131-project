assault and how that is maybe changing\nWhat what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of in\nThe three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students had to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em by the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and\nMake them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were\nThinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI\nDon't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in late into buses his you understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise] so\nUm you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nThere's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of a yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now I guess you know in the car\nSomebody now I guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistance to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means ... something days ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of you asked me yet but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always kind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you rented the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness twenty me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out well\nYou know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the demand is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly\nSo this is a little ...\nOkay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may recently you know guys try to come up and downs of you and
