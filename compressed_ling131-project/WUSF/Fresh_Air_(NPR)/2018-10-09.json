to the sixteenth of October\n\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross\nThe New York times just reported that in twenty sixteen Rick Gates then deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump\nRequested proposals from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to help defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton and the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective use of Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nOur country is hardly the only one in which political opinions have been manipulated by millions a fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up our guest today pi Wu singer and Emerson working say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us\nYou can say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of like feeling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaigns for instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing campaign\nBWI singer as a strategist at New America a consultant for the U.S military and intelligence community and\nThe author of several books immersed in tea booking writes about conflict and social media and was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations fashion as Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWill Peter Singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air you know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in his book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example a new rapid communications medium\nTransforming a military offensive is was the German invasion of France what happened\n[noise] so you had this new technology that are connected everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communication\nAnd radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political changes or the rise of not seeing some ... uh said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact\nOr when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allowing them to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of the things that contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figure it out really radio was what caused it all cause the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation it's surprise invasion of Iraq that allowed it to defeat a force that was a multiple times bigger it's part of these ... social media is in effect change the world\nAnd it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs and I credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on weight shot another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict and social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations Peter Singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\nThanks for joining us this is double USF eighty nine point seven um our case the latest on hurricane Michael from the Florida public radio emergency network is that for the Tampa Bay area this is going to be primarily I'll when you bad with some rain the worst of it coming early tomorrow morning we'll start raining\nThis evening but the high winds forty fifty mile an hour winds were more likely during the morning tomorrow we'll keep you updated throughout the afternoon right here on W. U. S. F.\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson Brookings he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you're right that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nIt was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the\nCampaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Hamas militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strike video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again in time or a mosque\nAnd get out again and again in time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how fire and is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered\nThan a month's would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives that these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... to one side or another ten million and all and it's first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and it's set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line but it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and knock out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the find a images you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cost and you know again badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in that kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from uh Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nSame way that you can enlist and Taylor Swift army of ...\nYou can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the a card and may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission\nTrust with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd source it so to speak and one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and later on to it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it to your own in\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a ... World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's on line army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with ...

speaking with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\n[noise] if you were watching your social media feeds during the Capitol hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that\nThe exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military were using all around the world you could see everything from open source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out [noise]\nThe um spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of law it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is and the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's a narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself for at least the online place that we go to a tablet should learn about history we compete ya so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russian shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term and during his hearing he said no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on weaken the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward it's going to see the kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks as part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just ... but maybe in some ways surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking\nAnd so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nAh so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of uh for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war\nA certain way to challenge also moved into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fake these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online where a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks look like would be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane a comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that ah Brock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can layer real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expression but you're controlling an online image of everything from an examples Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for a laugh it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...

out on line but it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and mapped out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale ...\nWhat you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important than the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the find a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cars and you know again badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel has done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from uh Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swiss army of ... and you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army\nThe uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in the but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the um ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise for\nA disease research and this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion\nTo drive it to your own in the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking authors of the new book like war the weapon a nation of social

Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\n[noise] if you were watching your social media feeds during the Capitol hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and it was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war\nThat military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where ah they were in lifting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket debt\nThen you've got the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data to basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was\nNow that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona and the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view but history itself for at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we compete ya so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over you\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian actors go under what competed very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nIn the same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook that sexual term and during his hearing he said no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about a drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on Wikipedia to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward it's going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections and the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people will talk about is essentially artificial intelligence or using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some ways the path um human intelligence and thinking\nAnd so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and seen images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nAnd it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way\nTo challenge also moved into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies in turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks look like would be good at subtly detecting water robotic ...\nLike would be good at subtly detecting water robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce the picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich are by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a an essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for a laugh it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
