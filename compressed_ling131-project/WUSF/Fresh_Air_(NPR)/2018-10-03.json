other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was not a unique character yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about oh you know well you know oh honey you know well do you just give that to your grandfather\nAnd I started to correct the person\nUh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the ideas\nSort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking is Paul mall and his sued and and had a couple of gambling he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one is lumps in Beverly Hills as when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you are doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia and part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\nA and there isn't a strange men need between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so writes unusual coming together and push a new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to you to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused\nYou know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know she didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your other arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second\nAnd then um he\nWas worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to move with him he's sort of save my life how did he say I didn't because I he paid a tangible than I did move in with him and then my little brother we all\nBecause I he paid a tangible than I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans to my brother took out and\nUm you know we our lives improved and we became much better students\n[laughter] school which was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place\nThat we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to have the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put it in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas at Harvard and on on a ... with Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mastiff so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students [noise]\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling [noise]\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage

doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix well\nThat leads to another scene that I Want to play the captain Han character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies and her\nHer age and closer and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hon says no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of you know Kevin how the feminist and the character and and in the novel\nA undercover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt just so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards or who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nSo solar trade for what\nIn college [noise] ten minutes ideology ally that I could have a career in their hand out just send them to build for Iowa is an idea\nWay second wave feminism for our ambivalent about having to [noise]\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog was\nBefore you tough changing the deadline is remember oh yeah oh we'll start as soon as I finish to play a\nLot after I get the story published finished the book\nYou blaming me going up like an [noise] oh I I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation [noise]\nA lot of women has been a hit forty one\nThought I could to [noise]\nJust don't think it's ... fault that we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors ever talk about a\nLie in bed with a turtle a my old egg\nAnd we're in the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise or sperm it's like on a sabbatical\nFor low low water so suppose not face\nSo that with Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in\nYour own mind yeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and kept her on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a demented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow votes the logic of the rights\nRemember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well um she sort of a leaps\nTo that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of upset buttering person\nThen this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what\nCatherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your uh to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um\nDelayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nOf away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish we really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you are getting out in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with\nThe\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was a performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean the money for one and I live by the skin to my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but [noise] and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your ... I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul mall and sued and hadn't had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills as one\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise]\nI'm right and there was an estrangement need between you are between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have\nAnd you know the complications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parents did during that time has made you so focused\nOn the idea of family [noise]\nYeah I mean I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ...\nWe moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother just ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um\nStudent housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents he paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother was you know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and\nUm\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place\nThat we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my\nShe gets she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very\nShe was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail through like olives and\nThings that you would put an ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um gap is there a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mouth off so was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen Seventy is world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and uh yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England it just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI'd just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at those you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that ... even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift
