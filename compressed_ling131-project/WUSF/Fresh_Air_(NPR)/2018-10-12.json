Jackson liberty in Washington counties none of those counties have any Gulf of Mexico coastline in the panhandle of Florida but while some of those areas with seashore may have had some lights on\nThe devastation leftover from hurricane Michael earlier this week is just breathtaking not since August of Nineteen Ninety to his Florida and Floridians witness this kind of wholesale widespread destruction from hurricane homes and businesses entire neighborhoods and towns have been turned to rebel\nMichael's wins we're just shy of category five speed it's storm surge sent nine feet or more of water barreling well inland Michael was a historic storm and it will require a historic response\nIn the state of Florida that's where we will begin this week on the floor to round up three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred is our state wide hotline three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred or you can join us on Twitter at Florida round up as our Twitter handles\nThe storm went from a depression to a serious category for storm in less than a week barreling through the Gulf of Mexico en route to the panhandle did you evacuate how are the early response efforts going when will you return how vulnerable\nNow are the early response efforts going when will you return how vulnerable is the panhandle to this type of destruction will talk about those questions with you three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred we spoke with NPR's Greg Allen just a few moments ago\nWell today I meant by a nice point I'm here at my producer of Becky souls and then we were visiting some of the oyster families people run oyster houses here a long long the Appalachian Kobe and really a lot of the uh the the ... places on the shore side\nOf each side of Ninety eight you know highly Ninety eight yard are gone there are few car well built ones that are still standing\nAnd do we talk to a definitely Barbara and Barbara seafood she's still shipping out some oysters and stuff that they're still working they got a lot of damage here she doesn't think there'll be why stirring anytime soon but there there are guys they're still in business pocket or to a live Lynn Martina ... limbs quality seafood is a retail store\nAnd restaurant and they took a pretty bad hit and he has no power thrown out here where they'll reopen but she's going through so if that storm surge through a lot of damage or any point\nYeah did up to four feet according to the initial reports did those folks evacuating and come back or did they shelter in place during Michael\nYou know everybody I talked to a sheltered here not by that the water not at the fitness property favorite Bible with back a little bit and you know is bad the storm surge was your it it's so far wipe Nicholas how it's really only affected\nThe business is on the sounds on the ocean side and then out about a block back not too far back so far we've we're still talking to folks but the people who are Stephanie Barbara upset her house came through file but when was\nTerrifying and we heard some of the same things from Lynn Martinez so you know that that this party it's really about the business or anything else\nNo you're not in the hardest hit part of the pan handle you are a little bit east of there are but what has been your sense of the initial response from first responders National Guard and other agencies trying to get on the ground\nWell yesterday we uh we were on Mexico beach now where the where a a Michael came ashore and that's the damage was is just stupendous there it's just you know it's it's it's a awful\nThat hardly a house in Mexico beach which is pretty small community but still hardly a house was was unscathed I mean we saw entire structure is the model where he's picked up thrown on top of the structures are a lot of what we're missing\nI ten is back open but they are not you\nKnow anyone aside from first responders\nOff of the ... the Panama City so I Would think that if you are going to try and get there you're gonna have to take some alternative routes and that's true for a lot of these places again first responders only is what they're stressing on the ground um because the damages so severe the infrastructure damage is\nThe severe um that really you're gonna have to take the back roads and to be quite honest it's going to take you a while um we actually have accrued that's currently stuck in trying to figure out a way to get\nBack home so yeah a great gal in described the trip uh yesterday from Tallahassee to uh Mexico beach is a nine hour trip in order to get there in Orlando Lisa on line five go ahead Lisa you're on the radio\nHi yes there is a major state prison Gulf correctional Institute and we way Hitchcock which is directly behind Mexico beach and I'm just curious as to whether or not there any reports\nAbout such ... do they evacuated the prisoners is there any power in the instituted I mean it's just uh I'm curious about that situation\n... any update on that ah that the prison that correctional institution\nYes I Do believe that that correctional institution was evacuated prior to the storm um I Believe that a governor Rick Scott did say that I'm In one of his brief things [noise] um so they had they did I'm actually get people out of the U.S some of those facilities prior to the storm\nAre looking ahead to hear a Brian I looked at the forecast today for the panhandle low eighties today yeah so that's the only thing mostly Ninety degrees by the middle of next week though yes but uh they're going to get a break here which often happens after fall hurricanes that happened a year after hurricane Wilma in South Florida\nThe drier cool that was an over hurricanes are relatively better air comes in but hurricane season is not over and uh we're still in the south and it's still hot months so\nIt's not going to be pleasant it's going to get hot before the\nThe power comes back on you but there was a Florida Atlantic University study that ah coincidentally was released this week the ten counties in Florida that had the lowest level of evacuation readiness are in the panhandle and in North Florida they rated on six categories such a special needs registries pickup location plans maps and\nAnd plans for pet evacuation plan had her with her sister station in Tallahassee WFSU\nOr what's the the the the kind of quick assessment of the evacuation readiness especially in a storm like Michael that are clearly did not give people much time to prepare\nWell yeah people we've heard from people who said that they didn't know it was going to\nPrepare well yeah people we've heard from people who said that they didn't know it was going to be that bad\nUm a lot of people did not he those evacuation orders and I've talked to people on the ground who say now they wish they had um they've been critical really of sort of some of the weather information that they got they said you know we heard it was going to be a category two we heard it was going to be a category three and then oh my God at the cap for\nAnd that just really speak to how strong and how fast the storm came up and really some of these smaller community is it it's really important to know some of the small coastal communities are low income community if their cash based\nThey don't have a lot of people and that really affects how people can get out and really even if people could evacuate if they wanted to if you don't have a car you can't go anywhere and so that really that you know contributes to the decision making of some of these people who\nGet on a lot of cases may have had no choice but to stay because they could not get out\nI Love to take a quick call in Miami lakes in South Florida Renee on line to Renee I'm tied on time please make your comment quickly\nAll right the real quick here I'm building codes that are currently a enacted in Panama City in that area we looked at what they are what's available in the county and it was just so much difference between a date county code in Broward County code but it's just you know there's no major knows no boundaries\nYeah certainly that is true those to South Florida counties a rare and click on time I'd want to get Bryan Norcross the chance to respond to that the Dade County South Florida coach were changed considerably in Ninety two or after the Ninety to uh Andrew affective\nIn October of Ninety four was a lot of work and the date and Broward codes are not significantly different things we're our code at the very top and it was a tiny bit less but the codes in Bay county and the panhandle are drastically last and I think shameful in less than they are here and stuff All right\nHow much less I mean the the the the wind code in South Florida homes must be built to withstand what kind of wind category for when and in the panhandle high end category too low and get her a nominally a hundred and ten miles per hour significant difference than in the in the Panama\nCity or in the western Mandel oddly their higher for no real good\nMeteorological reason Bryan Norcross is a hurricane specialist for ... television in Miami formerly with the weather channel he's going to stick with us\nI Want to send my thanks to learn how to news director of WFSU in Tallahassee thank you for your hard work and continue and hard work and Dolores ... a

she'll be back next friday on the broadcast\nThe scope of the damage left by hurricane Michael is becoming more and more clear by the hour beat side communities wiped out by the storm surge and torrential wins catastrophic damage at the air force base the dental Airforce base billions of dollars in damage a just mounting right now and a rising death toll across the path of the storm through at least a half dozen states\nNow while attention is uh properly focused right now in helping the victims of the storms especially here in Florida the science of the storm will be examined\nFor weeks months possibly years to come to learn more about how quickly the storm strengthened and the conditions that fueled and routed the storm to the pan handle this week an international group of scientists released a report warning of stronger storms higher seas and\nHotter weather without unprecedented changes to limit global warming\nSo how common are the conditions that fed hurricane Michael in the past week with hotter temperatures what's at risk throughout low line Florida are you changing your behavior are looking to get out of Florida or move away from the coastline because you're worried about climate change three zero five nine nine five Eighteen hundred statewide that phone number three zero five\nNine nine five Eighteen hundred or of course you can find us on social media at Florida round up on Twitter Bryan Norcross or hurricane specialist for W ... television in Miami formerly of the weather center is still with us and Kate Stein the environmental and transportation reporter in South Florida\nFor W. al Ahram Brian I I Want to circle back around to the forecasting of hurricane Michael we heard it in some of the phone calls in the last segment I concerns voiced about ah the accuracy of the forecast and it's a common criticism after a storm there's no doubt about it\nUm what's your kind of quick assessment about the accuracy of the cone and the accuracy of the intensity of hurricane Michael\nThe bottom line is they had two days warning that are very bad hurricane was coming if you looked at the actual numbers of was a category three hurricane forecast two days in advance\nThe rule the emergency manager rule is you always add a category to that because it's well known that\nA forecast for the intensity of a storm in the future generally plus or minus one category and sometimes even more than that the bottom line is that you wouldn't prepare any differently for a category three than a category for\nNow I take those people at their word that they heard it was a one or they heard it was a two and then they kind of reacted to that because people react\nFairly early in the process and make their commitment and what they're going to do they don't decide at the last minute or what to do they they they start early and\nOur system here does not is not conducive to people making good decisions what do you mean by our system but the hurricane watch goes up which is the first official alerting from National Hurricane center nominally two days before the wind starts blowing\nAh communicating in her estimation that connection between these kinds of ah of disasters and then the broader picture of climate change let's\nLet's separate or a couple of things one is if you're talking about hurricanes in the Nineteen forties a category for hurricane hit a Miami Dade County Nineteen forty five a category for hit Broward and forty seven category for hitting Monroe and forty eight category for head to Palm Beach county forty\nNine strongest ever to hit the ... the same way and I think thirty five and ...\nAnother category for hit downtown Miami in Nineteen fifty so it's not with hurricanes that were suddenly seeing a lot of strong hurricanes what we're seeing is hurricanes hitting this spectacularly developed environment\nWhiz higher sea level\nNominally higher sea level you know on the order of a foot compared to what it was\nA back when all these hurricane started in the early twentieth century so that's one thing that makes saying this is a a global warming climate change issue quite so definite because in actual fact in our adult lives where all the adults listening\nWe are having more hurricanes because we went through a low when we were younger but in our grandparents lived there were actually a lot more so these things are to some degree six to ...\nNot that's not at all to say that the heat waves and just the plain old heat that we feel the number of Ninety degree blessed day right and and the acceleration and and all of the problems that come with that and the coral reef problems and all those\nAnd and and all the problems that come with that and the coral reef problems and all those things that's a separate kind of threat so four boiling it down in an attribution in broadcasting is is a challenge to be accurate but we have to think of him as both major threats\nAnd also from you know the perspective of someone who tries to be an empathetic journal it it can it can be hard to you know see the devastation and\nYou know be reporting from Miami on what's happening in the panhandle and feel a sense of not not guilty but you know is this really the appropriate time to be talking about climate change and\nGlobal warming and you know how that plays into our vulnerabilities to\nHurricanes through the warming of the oceans and through sea level rise and you know given some thoughts that and I feel like I mean what else is inappropriate time you know our president he win his position on climate change I think it's pretty clear it's not something that he wants to talk about too maybe put it delicately\nBut and but he will acknowledge you know that he keeps talking about these monster storm and so there's a new then go to that as well\nLet me remind folks that you are listening to the floor to round up from Florida public radio\nBut the thing is and it's challenging and I think is important is that if we over attribute\nThen we actually do more harm to the message of making people understand that it's that climate change is an ex central threats to our lives in Florida because it gives people that want to be naysayers\nThings to hang your hat on to say well look they oversold it on that point I that's just a that's just a challenge of communications\nIn this arena lend me another challenge is just having enough time Mary and Vero Beach I Want to squeeze your phone call in before we're on a break here are just a couple of seconds married give us your thoughts\nAre high I my my thoughts are I'm tired I was away from where I Am the five AM and getting about this topic\nWe have a friend who was dead center and we can't go to all the time were Murray and I've already been through fancier than Jane we I don't know how my life that\nBought a house they will be safe not according to what's been happening since then found my thoughts are maybe it's time to go do we wait what if we get wiped out like what we're seeing on TV feel it really what what I rebuild new and you know no no no no\nThis is your is your thinking about all of this do you feel like now is the time to talk about climate change just very brief [laughter]\nWhen you said that I found out a lot yeah [laughter] when when does it not a good time to talk about it it ... it bothers me when people don't want to talk about it and not acknowledge it it's a big deal not jet for what we're talking about here but you also mentioned it changing things here in Florida and my husband\nMary we gotta Ron I'm Sorry to interrupt you are and and I hope that you're able to get a hold of those folks in the pan handle that you're searching for\nA case dined are with

Ross is out she will be back on the broadcast next friday\nRescue crews are still surveying the damage combing through the destruction intending to those most in need after the destruction left over by hurricane Michael in the panhandle first responders of course are on the front lines of this they come from all walks of life\nAnd the recognition is growing over the long term risks of the work well after the danger passes\nThe link between mental health and traumatic events is well known but acknowledging that risk to first responders is growing\nDriven here in Florida by too horrific mass shootings Parkland impulse ... is a health care reporter for a partner station in Orlando W. M. F. E. you worked on the trauma after tragedy project with W. V. and ProPublica he's with us with those studios in Orlando and welcome to the floor to round up\nOr what kinds of trauma or those first responders or potentially subject to a after I'm a helping out in a situation that they're finding themselves in in the pan handle this week\nSo there there was a couple of things to consider with um excuse me with the situation much after hurricane Michael you know they're they're going to be bringing cadaver dogs and they're going to be doing search and rescue\nSo they're gonna be going from home to home looking for hopefully survivors but unfortunately they're also going to be coming across people who are passed away and the storm so that's going to be a difficult thing for a lot of these first responders and you know the the other thing that consider what this is a lot of the responders who were who are search and rescue and do this kind of work\nThey're being deployed to you know not just um the panhandle but they end up going to a natural disasters in other countries you know to Indonesia to Haiti and so they're they're getting exposed to this this kind of trauma over and over again and that\nYou know eventually it's gonna you know for a lot of them cause them effects\nYeah it's a great point I Know of a of a search and rescue crew here with Miami Dade County fire search and rescue that ... had just returned from a deployment or in the Carolinas because of Hurricane Florence and just enough time probably to do their laundry before they were back up into a a disaster zone in the panhandle\nExactly it's you know it's it's an interesting kind of person who loves to do that work and obviously they a lot of them do find that very fulfilling but it it it can be taxing especially in the year like this where you've got all these you know hurricanes back to back in you know disasters overseas as well\nI think you're sitting right next to one of those are the people and ... is a junior goes by JR a retired from the Orlando fire department assistant chief they're worked on the department's active shooter plan for years I JR or what are your colleagues who are at work now in the panhandle\nWith a search and rescue efforts underway\nAt work now in the panhandle with a search and rescue efforts underway because of hurricane Michael what are they likely potentially to face in the weeks and months to come\nOr just a number of hazards right off the bat I mean ... ... if you'd like to describe it looks like a war zone just buildings that collapsed buildings they've got to search some of them unstable\nOr in you know God Forbid that they they have to run across or someone who's passed away or their mindset right now in search and rescue the key word rescue ... or they don't want to lose a life they don't want to find one dead they want to make a difference\nAnd I can tell you that that these folks that go out or their plan is to find people alive and bring them back home safe\nUh but there's going to be a lot of heartbreak and it does affect these uh these men and women that go out there and sacrifice themselves\nMore into our area on Sunday with partly sunny skies a slight chance

November sects and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security the federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election\nBut reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference well it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure happen we security systems\nHow does this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my guests Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or where the hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is attacks on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself or we saw them targeting\nA voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm\nLooking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different you know\nKnow what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still are not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture a poll books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you kind of what our used they're often not a tablets or or ... or or computers that are used to check people in 'em and uh uh as I said a last I checked and I think they have they they may have denied it\nOr at least had last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that there were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually\nBreached Charles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromise [noise] well\nUm [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversy or questioned him ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians\nUm what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think\nUm if we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems\nUm in the first um distinction we would make is between the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states um they got attacked\nThose are voter registration systems\nUm and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um or potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan on paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um\nQuite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities\nAnd so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known\nThat um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um\nRequire such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually and effective attack on them um and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so\nUm but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing because it's easier\nTo actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against the the\nGuts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour day right\nUm well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election I mean there are in that position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we're doing that\nAttacked and we're confident because of the logic inaccuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made but a skeptic\nCan I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but\nWouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so\nUm so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of and are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks\nThat we see it DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nTrue I I if I could just jump in real Christian point um I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets report it out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states\nUh that I Know of but in other countries on election night reporting attacks um and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nYou can join us for weekend edition tomorrow morning from eight to ten

U. S. F.\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow back in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change in signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impact such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ass\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree to save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more [noise]\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report\nAnd tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years is Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us ... fry 'em so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that parents are going to actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue effort from one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island developing states on one point five degrees out yet it's also going to harm wellbeing too at tremendous extent [noise] so what this report did was\nTo harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise] so what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\nTo for example on what they found is they look across a number of different systems and they found a for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming if you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects on us almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the arc in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most um [noise] devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous\nDoesn't look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to orange or to\nSee what the report finding that both on two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happen\nOn right now on a mission to are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phased out net emissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and the combination rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shift across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewable projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices on a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but not all we need\nYou know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with it\nPresident said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least two commission did what they do they use [noise]\nSure show on the way that the IPC she works on edge on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists and had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being\nUm reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically stats all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators calm make sure that they feel comfortable with the times the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] [noise] ah we're a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so I'm unable culture and I think what ends up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees\nPeople are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture\nIs the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to yield are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this was really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age but I Wish more the scientist will talk about that\nBecause we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel vial death\nOther things like that that will instill make us more\nPlants and we can have them for food feed and feel I oh you are you a farmer [noise] no I'm a researcher\nActually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feed them fuel all of the same maker and it uses little water and I just you know everybody thinks we're going to have some you know puts the will to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up as we switched to the renewables using plants", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Tampa", "day": "12"}
