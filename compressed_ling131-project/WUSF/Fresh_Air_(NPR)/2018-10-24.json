I Want you to reach our panelists\nIs ... calling us than engagement editor for Florida Today part of the u._s._a. today network and Anthony Mann political reporter for South Florida's son sent to them\nNow to the rules for tonight's debate and they are simple each candidate is sixty six\nSo the rules for tonight's debate and they are simple each candidate in sixty seconds to answer a question for bottles and the answers to follow up questions\nAre thirty seconds and they are at my discretion as debate moderator\nOf both candidates agree to forego opening statements because we want to allow for as much time as possible to get to those issues and those possible questions on the issues that you're saying is based on a drawing of numbers beforehand the first question goes to you\nToday pipe bombs were sent address to the homes with Michelle in Morocco bummer bill and Hillary Clinton as well as former CIA director John Brennan CNN\nCongressional representative Maxine Waters her offices and obviously the Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz here in Florida to her officers as well and I know the costs when Wasserman Schultz is here tonight\nBecause you're saying is just yesterday your campaign had issue that statement condemning another robocall racist robocall targeting your opponent\nHave we reached the point where divisive political rhetoric remembers one political party he didn't call the opposite party evil have crossed the line to push some people over the edge\nWhile it's great to be here I Am Ron de Santa some uh Iraq veteran and former prosecutor and I am on a mission\nOr to protect for the future I was at the congressional baseball practice when a gunman I tried to shoot my teammates they treat these college because he didn't like\nRepublicans and so I Know first hand that when we start going down that road or that can be very very deadly cry condemn that I condemn what happened today obviously we need to get the facts\nAre before we jump to conclusions\nUm but I think it is important and we try to unify and so my agenda has been I think something that the vast majority of Floridians can get behind\nNumber one I Want to keep our economic momentum going I don't want to raise taxes like Andrew wants to do I want to keep it going and build up the success we've had\nI also want to protect the environment that Floridians enjoy\nWe all want to have clean water we all know that\nThat is the life part of our state and if we don't get that right than Florida future's in jeopardy I Want to protect education opportunities including more vocational and technical training in our classrooms because those are the jobs of the twenty first century and I also want to protect our communities because you can have a good economy good environment if you don't have safe communities\nA than a lot of that doesn't matter clearly and with law enforcement officer and make sure that we protect for SBA address\nThe same questions activists who to send it so interesting question you should go on that is the vice of political rhetoric pushing some of us over the line and over the world\nI I think the answer is absolutely it is\nA we saw not only around the country but right here in our own stay a democratic elected officials who were targeted um thankfully nobody was hurt in today's a incident is a but we've we've really seen a collapsing of our political discourse\nUh my opponent as soon as he won the Republican nomination for governor went on Fox News and said\nAh to float voters here in the state of Florida not to monkey the state or by electing me uh it was followed up that same week by neo Nazis making calls into the state of Florida to attack my character jungle music in the background and the cause of monkeys are being heard\nUh we've seen neo Nazis empowered we saw what happened in Charlottesville the moral liquid vacation or that this president has demonstrated my opponent or endorsed by him\nOr has run this race very very close to the Trump handbook where we call each other names are where we run false advertisements and in this case every single one of his advertisement that mentions by name has been declared falls by politifact\nYelling at our time is up in the Senate and allow you thirty seconds well\nGillum signed a pledge\nHow you thirty seconds\nWell Andrew Gillum signed a pledge with a radical group the green team defenders to sign up for a radical manifesto attacked our police officers that said they have no place injustice that said they should be defined that he signed the manifesto that said the U.S with the biggest bully in the history of the planet\nAnd that we should take money out of our military that same group that he stands with fans by\nAttacking the state of Israel for boycott divest and sanctioned and they say Israel for genocidal apartheid state so you want to talk about division it doesn't get more does this have been the dream defenders and to this day and Andrew Gillum having or not we can damned wondering defender\nYou're going to give you a chance to talk to you and I\nI think it's only appropriate ... than to send the last debate lied Twenty one time Twenty one uh and now today makes the twenty second uh and we just started\nThis debate [noise]\nSome of the players that are behind it was to reject accepting political contributions from the private prisons\nThat same private prison industry that has given him hundreds of thousands of dollars to do their bidding he's owned by them I reject that and in my community we worked hand in glove with law enforcement to make up a city that has experience in a five year low in our crime rats you're thirty seconds and I have to give you a sin why did the pledge\nHe signed the freedom pledge say I support the freedom papers that the manifesto that's been documented in the press that it's a hundred percent true and yet again Andrew who's a career politician is never done anything outside of politics will not rush to accept responsibility for its conduct\nHe wouldn't accept responsibility for getting a thousand dollar ticket from an undercover FBI agent wife debate we now know that he lied about that\nAt some point you got to demonstrate leadership and accept responsibility for what she had done this sort of satisfaction [noise]\nAnd I asked the audience if you were to please not applaud because we want to have these two gentlemen get all their time in to discuss these issues and the question now is to you Mr Gillum your opponent says your quote embroiled and a lot of corruption scandals in camping trust you with running the state he says you are corrupt\n... as you just mentioned by undercover FBI agents looking for corruption in your city you socialize with them in New York City you said yesterday I told you you are not the target of their investigation now this week you know it was repeated text messages from a lobbyist\nWho was your longtime friend appear to show a high price tickets to Broadway show Hamilton came from the undercover agent not for your brother\nAs you said the question is for you did you know when you took that ticket from your brother in the lobby of the Richard Rodgers theatre on forty six they're Manhattan that an undercover agent posing as a developer had paid for the ticket and was gifting it to you\nI Know this has been a great theme of the news today and so I Want to set a straight especially for the benefit of my opponent\nOr one I did go and see Hamilton I I was aware that Adam Corey and I'm Mike Miller arranged so that we could go and see the show I arrived at the theater and receive my ticket from my brother\nUm the problem that I have is that I should have asked more questions\nTo make sure that everything that had transpired was above board I was informed by my brother at the time that he gave Adam Corey tickets to a Jay Z Beyonce a concert of which I understand they took later and I understood that to have solved or whatever the issue was with regards to the expenses associated with it\nBut I take responsibility for not having\nWith regard to the expenses associated with it but I take responsibility for not having ask more questions but let me tell you I'm running for governor or and the state of Florida we got a lot of issues in fact we got Ninety nine issues and Hamilton a one of 'em\n[noise]\nThey want to discuss [noise] uh but I Would ask him what happened to the hundred and forty five thousand dollars and receipts childlike taxpayer money that he is yeah you're really at all\nTimes of us are going to have someone to let you talk in just a second by the fall for you and that is how you assure Florida voters tonight in light of\nThese stories these scandals that you didn't violate ethics rules and that you won't be indicted somehow and throws a state into turmoil if you were to become governor\nDon't in fact you expected that to go the way when it was long but I think you both were going to go out to a panel is Anthony Mann\nShould give them your support a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in Florida and you support raising the state's a corporate tax rate from five point five to eight percent and you say that that money would generate a billion dollars to increase education funding but when those two moves on job creation\nBut when those two moves on job creation possibly quote layoffs because of rising payrolls cost of cheap some companies for moving to Florida and you know maybe even close some businesses to leave the state\nYou know and I mean we've seen this and other places are so number one let's get to the tax uh and and the revenue for proposal uh we're talking about my opponent has talked a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax\nI Am against a state income tax I've never proposed a state income tax a Ninety seven percent of businesses and the state of Florida don't pay any corporate tax rate at all Ninety seven percent and guess what I'm not proposing to change that either I'm Talking about the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in this state three percent\nA they received under the ... tax realignment which was supported by the congressman\nSix point three billion dollars from the federal government tax money our money\nUh always simply saying is that they can keep five point three billion dollars\nBut we deserve a billion of that to come into the state pay teachers ways they can live on offer access to high quality early learning to our children and third reinvest and apprenticeships wouldn't work shop mechanical electrical technical all of the degree or a training program that they could use to get a job monetize that job\nOr you know a second Mr Guillen horse or another question on the economy is already has a question from his new sense\nAnd his campaign on the economic momentum of Florida\nAnd United Way study last year shows that just under thirty percent of Florida families can be considered the working poor they worked fulltime but can't make ends meet how are you going to make it to help them get bigger paychecks so they can provide for their families\nWell what Andrus proposing these massive tax increases those are some of the very people that will be hurt the most\nI I started off making six bucks an hour it was a job that I needed to get through school I did multiple jobs\nUnder injuries plan I Would not have had a job I Would have made zero dollars and our businesses will leave the state people lose jobs and we'll stop people from investing in Florida it would be a historic mistake what I'm going to do is I'm going to welcome more investment in Florida and when I'm elected people will know Florida is going to continue to have a low tax climate we're going to be open for business\nAnd here's one answer is not telling you hear the history of raising taxes\nProperty tax increase as mayor very stiff increased property tax increase as a commissioner in Tallahassee even though he voted to give himself tens of thousands of dollars in additional retirement benefit\nAnd now he's proposing a forty percent tax increase which is gonna devastate folks but the J. A. M. I. studying nonpartisan said if you add up all of the injuries spending proposals the only way you could possibly pay for it either do is thirty eight percent statewide sales tax\nOr to yes impose a state income tax now here to tell you is going to do that but he has a history of raising taxes any proposal again Manafort will\nUh I I feel like it because you're talking about are Gilman plan before we get the next question I'll give you thirty seconds to talk about your plan and get forty five I mean the congressmen I don't want to share or [noise] you know fidelity toward the rules of the time and in his room and he continued to speak over you but I'll Try and do what I Can't ... the moments that I have\nSo uh this is the same congressmen who told us that by passing\nThat huge tax realignment taking money from all of the working people in this country and concentrating it with the top one percent of the wealthiest corporations that that money was going to magically tricky will trickle down and working people were going to get a raise and what we learned this week\nThey have drilled a deep hole into the national debt and working people haven't seen any appreciable rising wages let me make sure about that\nWhen working people get a raise they suspended they pay their rent and they pay their mortgage and maybe they set up enough to take a vacation and that shouldn't be\nPay their rent and they pay their mortgage and maybe they set up enough to take a vacation and that shouldn't be a no that shouldn't be too much and the state of Florida in two thousand and eight ten that\nIs your time ... says I'll give you know the ... if you want to\nLook injury was complaining about the economy we're in a situation now are unemployment rates like three point seven percent\nWere on a roll now I don't think we've reached our potential I think if we do it right we can expand Florida is economic base we can have strong technology sector strong manufacturing strong finance and we can get to the point like Texas where there's a national recession\nFlorida's effectively recession proof he's were attracting so much investment but you got to have a low tax climate we cannot allow Andrew Gillum to take away Florida's character as a low tax state I Need thirty [noise]\nThirty seconds to say this is the last thirty ... that's that's totally ... that's ... appreciate your generosity on time uh\nForty four percent of the people in the state of Florida said that they cannot make ends meet at the end of the month so Methodist sentences big donors may be doing just fine\nThey get their yacht sitting their boats but for the rest of the working people in this day they simply want a ways they can live on and having grown up to my mother who was the school bus driver and my father who was a construction worker and watching my parents trade between what's billed they could pay before something got cut off\nIt is enough of giving away to the wealthiest one percent in the rest of the people are struggling [noise]\nLeave on\nMr Jones questions for you you said we've got to end the for profit education system in reference to charter schools in this day ten percent of the students in Florida a ten charter schools to provide an alternative to traditional public education are you saying he would cut any dollars away from what sons charter schools in this day\nNo I'm not proposing any change to the current status quo but what we are saying is that we're going to put money into our public system we're over Ninety percent of our kids are still being educated and it's going to begin by paying teachers are ways that they can live on right now\nAnd the state of Florida teachers make an average salary that is the forty fifth low weight of all fifty states\nMet my grandmother she wouldn't just say that's a shame she would say it's a crying shame\nWe deserve the pay our teachers the ways they can live on Miami Dade a just a few miles from here the school board is debating whether or not they're going to have to change the zoning for property that's on school grounds to create affordable housing because teachers can't afford to live in the neighborhood that they work\nI wouldn't be here today were not from is our brain it's a little less on pain Mr Estes those teachers who poured into me created an opportunity for me to push past my limits to become the first of my siblings to graduate from high school graduate from college they deserve the ways that they can live on and when I'm govern and we're going to fight for it [noise]\nWas going to find\nA way I see audience again I Want to hear everything these gentlemen have to say so if he would hold your applause would be great but she was saying is we're talking education ... talking charter schools which I Know are important to you as well where do you stand\nWell Andrew singing a different to him because of the Democratic primary he said charter schools will be done and here's my thing they're public schools they're not district managed schools and so they have the ability to innovate and and be a little more nimble and these are parents who are making the decision\nTo send their kids to the schools and some of them are succeeding I mean you know the renaissance middle school here locally is one of the best performing schools\nOr you look at the performance\nHas been positive um you have minority achievement gap is narrowing and some of these schools so all I Want his results I think public education is very important I'm a product of Florida public schools but I don't think public education is anonymous with the legacy bureaucracies I think parents teachers and students are the heart of it not the bureaucrats that's who I Want to\nAnd teachers and students are the heart of it not the bureaucrats that's who I Want to empower and I'm On a mission to get location and technical training back into our schools particularly in the high schools we can partner with local industry and give them a good opportunities for jobs\nSo are your other types thank you very much for letting me jump in there I Want to give thirty seconds back to you Mr going\nYeah well let me let me say first off the congressman has accepted tens of thousands of dollars from back to devolve actually two hundred thousand dollars\nOr their agenda is simple it is completely to defund the public education system and to stand up the for profit charter schools industry for profit my opposition was to for profit schools are in this state uh this is what we ought to do we ought to unleash the talent of teachers to teach\nAnd unload on nice in my opinion the unmitigated talent of our students to learn\nWhy should we force eight Ninety percent of the kids are going to focus only on ten percent of the writer that's not what they deserve thirty seconds Bactrim mystery to status now\nSo anyone enough and anything for profit you would get rid of that means you're gonna up and the lives of two hundred and forty thousand students and the state of Florida and getting these are students whose parents were making this decision who are performing well and here's the thing\nI Want accountability for all of our schools including public charter schools and went on governor I'm going to push for a new requirement that if you're gonna start a charter school you need to buy insurance for the whole first year cost because if it's not working I don't want the taxpayers on the hook for that I'm Out what works\nAbout what Andrew is saying is really going to disrupt a lot of families who finally have a school that is right\nFor them and that it's time Mr dissatisfaction with civilians thank you it's time to take a breath\nPerhaps take a drink of water we're going to take a two minute break and we'll return with decisions when Eighteen before you vote the debate for Florida governor when we come back [noise]\nI'll ask the question of a card game and I I'm given for the question is are okay\nHe also said if blacks are oppressed in America why isn't there a black accidents\nNow in two thousand Fifteen in your speech before the freedom center you set of Mr Horwitz\nDavid has done such a great ... great work and I've been in the ... I've been to these conferences in the past I've been a big admirer of an organization that shoot straight tells the American people the truth in standing up for the rights and those are his words here's like hearing that even made those statements and fire yesterday heads are the first statement was made\nTo help them I supposed to know everything of savings that many many parents that they are\nJust say that's let me just say that's straight out\nOr you know I live my life whether it's athletics whether it's military whether it's serving as a prosecutor you know when I was down range in Iraq we work together as a team regardless of race we had the American flag on our armed we wore the same uniform and we fought for the country\nWhen I was a prosecutor\nSet up for victims of every race color and create that the only way to do it in our country it's something I Believe in as governor I Will represent all the people everyone will get a fair shake but I Am not going to bow down to the altar of political correct that I'm going to not let the media to near me\nLike I like to do with so many other people certainly aren't going to take anything from Andrew Gillum who's endorsed the dream defenders which says Israel is an apartheid state and which says you're very cemeteries lights and they are there\nFor the Senate from what I Wish you would have waited\nFor the question 'cause I had a question and it's not what you think of his Mr Guillen we'll give you a chance to respond to let\nMe first say my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nMr dissented says spoken a hit first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day\nHe had spoken at racist conferences accepted a contribution and would not return it from someone who referred to the former president of the United states and the Muslim in I. G. G. E. R.\nOr when asked to return that money he said no he's using that money to not fun negative ads now I'm not calling this the dissenters the races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist [noise]\nIf I Would ask the audience to please the senators and our response\nConference I attended what keynote at by a medal of honor recipient named Clint Romesha day it was not a racial conferences that as a absolute why and I'm not going to sit here and take this nonsense\nFrom a guy like Andrew Gillum who always play the victim who's going out and and attacking as you aligning himself with groups to attack our men and women in law enforcement attack our military he's still will not disavow the dream defenders none of these things people are saying that I endorsed he endorsed the dream defenders and they endorsed him and that is wrong [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah happy to speak on that first of all he continued to attempt to manipulate my record to me that I'm against a law and order first of all under my leadership as a mayor the state of Tallahassee we hired fifty new law enforcement officers\nWe connected but those law enforcement officers hand in glove with the community to community policing and my city we're experiencing a five years\nHand in glove with the community to community policing and my city we're experiencing a five year low in our crime rate he described in the last debate a city run a mud and the politifact had to correct him on that as well I Would miss the dissenters shows as he simply has no relationship with the truth\nOr he didn't have it here as a candidate and he certainly wouldn't have it as a governor but we won't have to worry about that because we retire him on November sixth and keeping [noise]\nI'd like to move on if we could\nAlready I'll give you a thirty I'll give you thirty and then well now let's gentlemen I don't want to make this the issue for the rest of the debate of who's doing about the fact matter last year Tallahassee under the Gilman ministry and at the highest number\nOf murders in the history of the city the guy running to succeed him as mayor right now with the injuries former chief of staff he's sending out flyers saying last year we had the most murders in history we need change we need leadership yeah because Andrew failed on that Tallahassee is one of the most primary city in Florida bar none of them are the facts\nI Would suggest the congressman\nMight want to reconsider whether he wants to be governor the governors' mansions in Tallahassee I Would hate for you to be heard several\n[noise]\nBecause if if if we were to leave your vision of the city which is completely inaccurate the city of ground to murder in Tallahassee is on a pace to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate and we did that by at the same time arresting fewer people or the city of Tallahassee works hand in glove with law enforcement\nAnd that's why we're ranked an all American city this week we're just rang a number one place to raise a family and that's the kind of city we live\nLife is is that you will move on now and that's the question is from Anthony man from the sun central\nCentral Florida man's films who have completed their sentences from voting what's your position on the proposed constitutional amendment would automatically restore voting rights to films have completed their sentences except for convicted murderers and sex offenders\nI think it's wrong to automatically restore rights to felons who've committed very serious crimes now I think ... I Want people to be redeemed I Want people to be able to show but you've got to prove that you're getting back\nWell with the law you got to prove many felons re offend and I think it's wrong to automatically give them a of a free pass to be able to vote without them showing that they can be back\nIn our community also think it's very important just as a\nFormer prosecutor you know we've dealt with law enforcement I'm committed to having safe communities fact matter at Andrews making jokes about Tallahassee when they had the highest number of murders in their history last year I don't think it's funny for those murder victims and their families\nI don't think it's funny that you make light of crime because I Know how devastating that can be at the victim's family stood with families\nWho've had their lives turned upside down by some very very bad people and I think we need to protect our community I don't want to go down the road where crime is spiraling out of control and so I Want people to be able to earn their way back but you got to earn it you don't get it for free and\nRemarried you'd like to dress the course of action was going on with your position on the proposed constitutional amendment absolutely if it doesn't pass would you continue the Scott or a policy or would you go back to the policy of undercover\nSo that meant to dissent has never had the responsibility of the obligation of leading a community through a crime or helping to fix a crime problem so he wouldn't recognize that the number one way to reduce crime and the community is to reduce the level of recidivism\nOne of the things we can do to help with the recidivism rate is for these one point seven million individuals who don't have the right to vote or the constitutional amendment doesn't give it back to everybody\nBut if you have done your time and you've paid your debt to society you ought to be able to re enter society how your concerts\nAnd you've paid your debt to society you ought to be able to re enter society how your constitutional right to vote and you're right to work here and the safe because if they don't have the opportunity to make a living for themselves and your audience armies are spending as much time very much I Want to go to is it or around and go in Florida Today though\nMr Gillum during a CNN debate on Sunday you vowed quote to hold these folks who are the biggest polluters accountable\nAnd powerful sugar interests industry has often lobbied against environmental proposals in Tallahassee you're a longtime friend an advisor Sean fit men lobbies on behalf of a Florida ... one of the largest sugar companies and the state among other interest\nYou have also said he won't demonized the workers who rely on the sugar industry how can you go to stress that you will hold its powerful industry accountable well\nThey can begin by looking at my record on the environment and energy and the fact that I'd been endorsed by nearly every major environmental organization out there the same week that Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris accord\nAnd my city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce under the Rick Scott administration we have taking away the word protection out of the bar a department of environmental protection Methodist answers and Mr Rick Scott\nOr negate whether or not global warming and climate change is actually a real thing\nAs to what Florida voters will first need to know about me is when I when this race for governor don't have a governor who believes in science\nAnd we will hold all of the major polluted in this state to include big sugar a to include a big ag but also to include the out of control development that it's happening north of Lake Okeechobee so that we can get them real standards back into the state and clean up this blue green algae that's flowing out of the east and the west side of the state of Florida how\nWill make that commitment because that is consistent with my values are and you have a follow up is it or is that correct\n[noise] I have a question for Mr dissented same time\nYeah on the environment and you support the reservoirs thousand Lake Okeechobee which many experts agree well a reduced charges east and west however the reservoir doesn't do anything to car pollution going into the lake in and said tributaries that end up in the lagoon and as soon as the river\nOr the last eight years under discussion administration we didn't see in the past of deregulation a deep cuts to water management districts so my question to you as well you reverse that path of deregulation in Florida\nSo I have a very strong environmental plan because the water is our life but we have to protect the environment Floridians enjoy it affects quality of life it affects health and safety all the drinking water\nIs affected by having clean water restoring the Everglades our economy's affected by it\nBecause if you don't have clean water we lose our status as a tourist destination could end up being a a high tax states because we don't get the revenue we need so I'm committed is my vision is very simple people on the Waterman management districts they're not going to be a stew driven industry they're going to understand what is happening on those coastal communities",
