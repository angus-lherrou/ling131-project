Jim welcome to fresh air [noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here um the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work\nBarbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian and much you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the census preservation of of um ... workers ah you know there were were expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe yeah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite nervous that to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character book or George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go served the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nBut the masters brother is there his name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lotta nicknames like and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed be his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight she's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment to change it washes live forever because a bond forms between him I'm the most white men church um and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the vendors boy's life and not arbitrary knows forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really I'm surprised him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely [noise] you just naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under ... which [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore it teaches character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded man for his time ah you know there are limits to ... to his thinking that teens and a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and and notions ah [noise]\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of man it's kind of weird prescribed beliefs but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow white people to get them to have them if they\nAllow such cruelty yeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his\nA philosophy or adult life but you know having said that he is somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash the skips from slavery and becomes a free man\nSo they'll wash the skips from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the point\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that some teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these ... ideas that she is at him because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his

queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhaust Dave I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that

sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage\nHis younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nTo pitch in lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detail scientific

plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cutter ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air group colder correct in webs across my skin all was shadow red light storm firing frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends attempt to float above the consequences of race springs a leak and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy in bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nTell other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from ... which elevates watch but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater

be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know we were expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher the yeah the condition and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire\nAnd on it you know quite ... to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like [noise]\nThe main character booked a George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go to serve the demand house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by touch there's a lot of nicknames and uh she's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because the system mainly just because he's like the right weight he's for ballot for the balloon [noise]\nUm and it's a moment to change it washes live forever because a bond forms between him and the most white men touch 'em and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change and the and the boy's life not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\n[noise] Christopher does choose Washington because he sees him as being helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stats are which is\nThe right weight a demand is arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith natural gas like he has no no idea you know that this\nThis young man it's just completely you know some naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a a you know good sense for 'em or an article methodologies ... and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nA into just character in you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and and notions ah [noise]\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of man it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery as the slavery won't allow white people to get them to have been inspired allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this this could have central to his\nA philosophy a about life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to kill a great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy and his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash it skips from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from time to lift them um you know was haunted by the time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave accommodate\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that some teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these on my ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Tampa", "day": "15"}
