front Derek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we know is racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an extra\nWhen he was in his early twenties and a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\n... welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nDared black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find Don black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Ballard\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight am to white nationalist slogans\nFourteen or first throughout a fourteen word\nSort of statement of purpose that is central to what strong front does about um\nIt was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at you know in and saying things like\nI'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get get murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on storm front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... ... hours had had said that um he believe the Jews were committing genocide against his people and genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's\nI Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and\nThat's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In storefront is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere is some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who've spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well this\nProbably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself but our our\nGlobal is and ah choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get\nFrustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either gone or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think that in the movement said to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked slow is the author of smoke rising out of hatred about Darren lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the

communities of Florida tickets wrote live HD saint Pete dot com\nIs is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we mounting those views when he was twenty two he\nHelped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nEric's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black and the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included ... the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better now but we're all better off being separated by by\nRace is like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in into that with him saying\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being one that\nHe didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nTo her for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\n\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit\nProud a confident way\nSplits a proud a confidante way\nIn central and everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insults were they when a client word [noise] um ratio is racial our ...\nOver the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively pursuing an end cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland sense white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacists and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinct distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who

why midterm matter for redrawing our electoral map that next time on the take away from WNYC NPR I\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy and and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races in two different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed type a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we going to define who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me by definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe in uh south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that sort of conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually wide by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're

founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli sass low the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nYou were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views [noise]\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people their ... tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were outed by somebody else you play the magazine [laughter] you must have had like ... with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black so after you kind of out of yourself\nAnd if you're having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who need aged if we didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nFor and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die by their life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people in having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a\nCivil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who\nAh who won one who stress built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew ...\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with that and he would be able to begin seeing pastor stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the police them this ideology and the thing is that Derrick instead Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and I\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and so Matthew in motion a had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case\nAnd their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in most states

I had had said that um he believes the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDo and both on an Derrick\nJews are committing genocide\nThey do and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about that you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal to white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front\nTo the shooting at the synagogue I'm In store front in the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founder son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nAre some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial or\nSome people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um is is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people you've spent time on strong front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well\nThis probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our boiled with and are Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to\nBring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Garrett black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders um you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into ... incidents like this I'm\nDerek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popular I think the movement to then have somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself spread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife\nIs a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked ... who is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack of former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break distance fresh air\n[noise]\nHi I'm Melissa rod ... joined us friday for the floor of around them where we talked about the biggest stories in the state [noise] from politics to education the environment and more news in Florida we want to hear from you let your voices be heard joined the conversation on the floor of her own\nMethod friday at noon right here on two of us have eighty nine point seven [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe've got to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Jared black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now in seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz word used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nGarret black and the subject of the book rising out of hatred my Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli Sasha low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included Sasha so the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we are better now but we're all better off being separated by by race\nLike it's not that we're better now but we're all better off being separated by by race is like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called that a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nIn central is everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nToo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insults were they ...\nThe word [noise] um\nRacial less racial our ... over the years if you look at the language in terms of how many people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identified a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an and cause of separating or\nYou know racing into into different homeland sent white supremacy unfortunately it's something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures are based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk\nAbout it we're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced the use and\nWashington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and

views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you did you had been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views [noise]\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God it's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when they found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out you\nEven had a girlfriend ... we didn't ... initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and are mostly Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy that I think was a very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up ... every ... other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the map you said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die by their life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from and it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd is it effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early were\nEither this is this is crazy when you stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves\nThe real courage shown by a lot of students on campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of ... out and made it clear to him how how awful and how it for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who\nAh who won one is trust building relationships but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through and and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with that and he would be able to begin seeing past the stereotypes to the people into the humidity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that's not happening quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... case yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and I\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and so Matthew in motion a had also in their own life experienced large degree of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust in Bergen dose and and that was the\nDefinitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a by by an an incredible history of anti Semitism and and the Holocaust and\n... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect
