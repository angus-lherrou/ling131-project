Jarrett Jake ... in his official author name and the tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph\n... ask a welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting leak but they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she was a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trust him one friend my friend Patrick my best friend like right next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I get older sometimes I ... I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I share that story more widely\nThat people must have asked you like kids must have asked you all the time like how come your grandparents are raising humor as their parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say I may be trapped my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway how does your father you didn't even know who we want\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid around me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go and their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties\n[laughter] I got to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you Kurds but if you ever curse at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know um they smoke two packs a day each nah or\nAnd my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point where he said Jesus Christ by the time I dying to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer that yeah you die from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years off so heavy smoker also heavy smoker and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife should be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always have thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and just like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh it's oh gosh that's deemed as though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always at a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nDrunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was on\nYour head recurrent nightmare as as a child about monsters would you describe a nightmare\n[noise] this recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just forests\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster a monster my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping and every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and makeup sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I mentioned I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then\nKindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school St building for nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone to any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know do stigmatize you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me art was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in mice sketchbooks and and in my drawing\nWhen you took art classes and you're in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how George Miller of like if you're like you're drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nOh this is the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I can I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was mean that that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive woman slips this is how you have to draw muscles\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent\nHe he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and it's in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that is a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style a nation develop that he did say that but did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for if\nIt's certainly a there's a lot of a gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch had been fully blown but\nNot right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise] you know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know real one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J.

'cause Oscar and his official author name\nA tribute to his late grandfather who was named Joseph Jackson has to welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award\nOh thank you so much Terry Gross\n[laughter] did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting make what they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go on to another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nMy grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward [noise] um you know why they got older and sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school somewhere\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I ... I Would share stories with people in high school some want but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand and twelve that I shared history more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents raising you as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe ... my story telling skilled began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nReally a mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nHad come home from school\nAnd somebody wrong to me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go in their hat [laughter]\nNo at the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties\n[laughter] I got to go back to school about [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crafts though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us\nThey want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise] um they smoke two packs a day each nah or\nAnd my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience it to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years is often a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say\nTo 'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday on my wedding shower with that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife should be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom\nAnd you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her and it's oh gosh that's game so we're so lucky the host and explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people when they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was uh my my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurrent nightmare as as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise] this recurring\nDream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping and every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and and yet they're in they're in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise] probably some\nTime just before high school I mentioned I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years [noise]\nGrade so I was at the same same school same building for all of nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone to any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's weird for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in mice sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes 'cause he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I can I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive woman slips this is how you have to draw muscles\nAnd this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artists are drawing them professionally and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and drop somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style a nation develop that he did that upset and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comic flux Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics that that was actually useful for if\nYou certainly a there's a lot of a gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that's the punches like really real back or the punch had been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J.
