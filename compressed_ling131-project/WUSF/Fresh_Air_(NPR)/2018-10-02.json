USF\nIs fresh air and Terry Gross the federal government under President Trump is the subject of the new book the fifth risk by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany central positions and the Trump Administration remain\nResponsibilities many essential conditions are met Trump Administration remain unfilled\nAnd some of the key positions Lewis has a fellow by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseen well others have conflicts of interest that political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you considered the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um stories and obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a a a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was about what is trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversation with foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nLooks it looks like we're having a technical problem there and we played there on tape so we are now going to hear my interview with Michael ... sorry about that Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is just the risk that you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nBut I'm data and how it's collected and how to interpret it has it's changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know that the people who try to explain to him how the department work came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department work to have\nFound that he was really utterly disinterested in anything but trade so even if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission of the department additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure is finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare its financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes ritual lifted calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovered that he'd been lying to the for the rich list all along\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice if you're very odd choice because with that department really need someone who's really comfortable with technology [noise]\nWell if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist wreck and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nAnd the five stars weighing frame or has been a rock and roll legend and he's been a prisoner in his memoir the hard stuff you know hundreds when it comes to showing the fluffy tail of a difficult life\nAny more of a disease embarrassing couldn't possibly be any good human life is messy so told stories from a life events here you have to do there are\nWe supposed to ... this week on some independent\nAnd that is Saturday afternoon at two o'clock you're on W. USF\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nYou know I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments\nOf action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy that most of my time paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on but it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like we're still sidey of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the big on the side of it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abused and score and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much ... nobody's paying much attention because of slow moving story and it's to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the got a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up or\nYou know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives and another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been from very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department Leno let that kind of level of government where things are being I'm done with physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the ... we asked the kind of spam includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what are you doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's for sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department\nAnd they simply don't National Weather service by the\nNational Weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no ... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into Congress department as an actor vengeance\nSo it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there and it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical\nAnd er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center is\n[noise] well um\n[noise] well I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's abuse you know when the giants science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut the weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property\nOr is that the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how the weather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIt's the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean the the billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah adopt the radar the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air\n[noise]\nHi I'm Ira Plato and I'm bringing my shows science friday to town on November seventeenth\nNow tickets go on sale this Friday but if you are a W USF member you can buy your tickets now just visit W USF dot org slash sigh fry to learn how if you're not a W USF member you can become one right now for instant access\nThank you to Elizabeth more and W.

I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think that at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bond is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole all that money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm it would that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why would if you treat them by the national crisis well because the dollar is the world's reserve\nOf a dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would have predicted some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's funny\nWhen you predict things funding or predict things where where we may happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fifth wreck and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nIt takes decades for patterns of social behavior to change for me to has been on the nation's mind for just one year\nSome hope it will bring about the kind of changed not seen since the fight for women's suffrage I'm Joshua Johnson what the me too movement means for those in power and for our politics next time on one day from WAMC you had to deal with and we hope\nYou'll stay with us for one aide just ahead at one o'clock here on your NPR station Mike Lee of spectrum ...

F. dot org ... click the events tab at the top of the home page\nIs is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and Commerce Department [noise]\nYou know I'm learning there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nTo um that Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level [noise] and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of my time paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like a sexy and story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where's the party of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the biggest ... we ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nAbuse and scorn and it's collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving stores and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the got a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives and another they're all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been it's been thrust is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public has gone along with it and that's ... that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done when conditions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in his death threats atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's for sixty five percent or so the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and this includes National Weather service at the national weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance\nSo if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department a and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical\nAnd er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry ...\nAbout the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather that sounds actually like a good that he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem ah typically the person who\nRuns no or has had a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's abuse it knowing the giants science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... just a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut but weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or that the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to communicate with the public\nUh it it has to let the rest of it has and has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place it's the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that the these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spent the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon eyes is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYou know you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nYou know private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer should use of genomic testing the profile each individual cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while I think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds and it's causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalize and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you could read the national center\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you ask me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would have predicted some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun\nWhen you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] we're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nIs is W.
