package um and you know the postal inspectors I mean that that that ... that\nIs that if somebody's packages were found out I mean literally nearly a billion a day that's going through there so it's

Jane in Orlando hey Jane thanks for holding you're on the air now go ahead\nI just want to make a comment I I think we have to remember that the president was elected as a minority in the last president to the electoral college on a majority of Americans did not vote for him\nSo it's encouraged people to come very much one sided for or against the president or for it\nI'm very much one sided for or against the president or for I get ill or the Democratic party\nAnd the root cause of tribalism of course a hate just you know just regard for that just the rights of everyone\nBut I think we have to remember that President was elected as a minority elected president to the electoral college and that ... to the purging tribalism in our country\nJane thanks a and I I think that it's an important point it's certainly on the Democratic side it has a ... it's driving voter turnout in the mid term elections it's driving anger at the president\nIt's also driving Republican supporters to uh be ever more supportive of the President Jimmy Jimmy in Jacksonville oh we've dropped Jimmy let's go back to David over by a\nA with just a minute or two to go before the break David a ... you know you hear the emotion in the calls are and as you pointed out the fact that people are following this story so closely as we get right up to the midterms in Florida with this\nHard fought governor's race in this hard fought Senate race both of which are hanging by a knife edge it's so uh unfortunate that an incident like that since ratcheted up the political tension even more in this country\nAs you said it's important it's important for everyone to just take a breath and wait to learn more uh you can you\nShare any more about uh what you're going to hopefully learn later this afternoon or from the authorities\n[noise] um well I think I'm obviously we're going to learn the uh the political leanings of this person and you know it's possible that\nI'm In one way or the other ... you could just be someone that you know like so discourse in sort of anarchist type I mean I'm I think that's something everyone wants to know um but at the end ah\nYou know it's going to be a criminal act or they're going to want to prosecute him so they're going to want to build a good case um and uh and I suspect you know the the the the terrorism investigators you're very very good um and you know they've had experience with that experience here in Florida\nA with these types of connections over the years so um I think this will just only make things more divisive um but you know it's been going that way for a long time so I don't\nI don't fortunately a fortunate yeah wonderful reporting by you and we think he's so much for joining a statewide with this uh just learned information about uh the suspect uh from Florida and\nHe's from David ... with the Washington or rather with the Miami Herald distance of Florida round up more to come including those ballot amendment

to become resorts essentially Vegas style resorts\nUm they don't have to go for this a statewide referendum or that amendment three what would require of mutual if they want to go for\nUm a expansion of gambling and the other thing that's interesting is that also doesn't it it changes the definition it changes the the playing field for um watchdog gambling is in Florida um the tribe operates under a federal agreement through\nUm through a compact or does it work it's subject to federal laws and other state laws and the tribe doesn't like the state laws because there are a bit weaker so um it's a it's a big win for the tribe\nInteresting and if you're just tuning into the Florida round up their gambling going on in these parts in Florida that is a but there are amendments on the ballot that would affect not only gambling but dog racing\nWe want your calls at three o five nine nine five Eighteen hundred and so it's interesting to look at the photos on the supporters of amendments

is it would see greyhound racing just be discontinued in the state by the year twenty twenty and since eleven of the nation Seventeen greyhound tracks are in Florida naturally the focus of the celebrities is right here on\nFlorida when what are your thoughts about all of the animal rights activists that and celebrities that have really a\nGotten involved in this cause\nI I think at the end of the day the philosophy here and I you know I work closely a regular closer with both sides whether it be the the the Florida ground association and also great to tell you which the greyhound a great on advocacy group out of a out of Boston\nI'm In actually I just when I just threw them facility in Sanford I I called my I called the director of great you came and told them what I saw and I

because\nNow think about that would you want your dog to be living that life and that and that's right there is the the philosophy and then and there was it was carry the which I think it's as if\nShe says those ... you know a lot of the trucks and the state or are probably going to be the same condition but it's it's that working dog condition and you know the you know hanging out in these changes with a piece of without you know remnant of carbon on the floor that I think the dogs I saw you know five or six times a day [noise]\nYou know and I think the great UK wants you know once people to compare that to how they're home pets as my my dog at home who's actually happened she happens to be a rescue dogs she sits in air conditioning all day and and and chase the squirrels over from I'm a

these changes and safety measures were only a implemented a few years ago after um a lot of a lot of pushing from the legislature and also from\nFrom advocacy groups and for whatever reason they didn't they didn't want to until they you know we it was only two dozen Thirteen started getting dog death reports and it's like yeah like story when one of the prisoners of me and he had\nJust gone

lots of cold as we speak with Eric start kissing a political Florida\nAbout gambling and dog racing in the state a couple of amendments that will be on your November ballot\nCertainly people get very intense and emotional about animal rights and the treatment of animals which is why this greyhound racing amendment amendment Thirteen has generated a lot of attention including from quite a few Hollywood celebrities will that make a difference in your vote well let's get to a few of your calls right now\nLots of folks waiting on hold from all across Florida Kyle is in Lakeland, Florida hey Kyle how are you this afternoon go ahead\nI'm doing great how are you OK things my [laughter] my comment deals with um [noise] the people opposing minute Thirteen there's a large community of like dog to competition people such as like agility rally hurting who believes that\nThe wording in the amendment leads toward any time based competitions in the future it might be able to be like stripped um for dogs competing those even when they're not humane such as race dot com groundbreaking\nOkay thanks for that Eric\nFrom I think that actually the the amendment protects that I think that there is one of ... that are there's one there's one our dog racing band that comes to mind in Nineteen Ninety sixty out of the uh Iowa legislature passed a law that have been all dog anything anything waging on that has to do with a dog they they they banned it\nSo I don't know if you've ever been to a dash on racial wiener dog race or sometimes to have them for charity those were banned troops don't how now as of last year and now the lawmakers are trying to figure out how they can get that back in there it was too expensive\nThis actually as far as I can tell them from the interviews that I've done just would just impact wager greyhound racing in Florida it would affect the loving tracked we have here in Florida\nUm it gives them the option that they ... they can stop doing that can stop doing the library says as early as the as a as junior as generous to those Nineteen or they have until twenty twenty\nSo it's I think it's focused enough so that is not going to impact other areas of uh of you know would dog competitions or some other friends there's there's French obedience training and what not um but there are some concerns from like the n._r._a. about how uh some other son says in the in the amendment that might affect other things that people really aren't aware [noise]\nGotcha okay surely in Ocala hello surely what are your thoughts about amendment Thirteen\nAnd then re I

stool samples filtered down right through our body yet we eat them and then we send about the other end\nOnly a matter of time right with all the micro plastics that are around us\nRight researcher that's on micro plastics and tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that all you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic pick out containers are up in wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there's no harm coming from the\nVery difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of ... parts out um you can't really be people some people plastic samples and\nParts out um you can't really see people some people plastic samples in not beat other people plastic samples at this point it's just not ethically feasible\nBut um it it's hard to tell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they made me ... into the human body so it's it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't don't panic because it could be yes it could be that they're harmless but it's very difficult\nYou know those of us of a certain age I always thought that it spreads this was harmless also back in

ideas about what [noise]\nI think because there's such a long time it wasn't really understood and the only thing that was understood was that when you saw it was probably a very bad thing because it was usually followed by injury and death so obviously it was a really powerful substance\n... um [noise] but it wasn't really understood ferry while until after the last hundred hundred and fifty is

the things that if there was talk about uh the taboos about blood you visited India where there's a man trying to break this taboo tell us about that [noise]\nThis is a guy called his show name is ... guy he's got a long time I'll name he's from South India and I'm a lot of Indians will know him better as pat man because it's been a bully what film about him about his story is ex Jordan\n[noise] because it's been a Bollywood film about him about his story is extraordinary he was in a very poorly educated um young man and his wife came home one day hiding something behind her back and he ah he thought she was teasing and they had a bit of a tussle\nAnd she eventually um showed in that she was carrying a bloody meant to Iraq so a lot of Indian women use cloth they don't have ... they don't caught food sanitary pads\nCommercial signage pilots are chanting like millions of other Indian women and across the developing world was using cloth there's nothing wrong with that if you can clean it and I'm wash it Hi Jeannie clay but because of taboos that often doesn't happen anyway ...\nI'm a shanty why she couldn't afford 'em commercial than she pads because he'd seen them in the

sanitary pads machine\nThat can be money they'll ... can be afraid to pilot ... women and there are now for thousands of them all over I'm full of the world but the way he got to understanding he had to do a reverse engineering to understand what was in commercial than if you pass because he thought it was just caught and yeah\nSo he decided that the best way to do that obviously was to wake up

two seconds that Ryan yeah and uh I was given the breakdown of those things and it'll it'll make sense\nI how how how did this idea of banking blood first come about\nWell what I mean we haven't been this the system that we're all used to which is the master of nation and um supply and transfusion of blood it's really not very old a total of about a hundred and Twenty years old and in the beginning I'm In the U.S in the u._k. they ...\nThey started in pretty similar fashion that\nPeople were selling that blood um they had this project that they could sell them on and so they did and I was even a union of love celebrate New York and the people who men usually who traveled around the country I'm selling their blood so they're with their own kind of blood market\nFree um selling their blood so they're with their own kind of blood market um but eventually in the Nineteen thirties or adoption Chicago called ... to ... I'm trying to organize things a bit veteran he was\nConvinced that the best thing to do and wants to treat blood as a commodity rarely so he thought that was when ten must come out and if you used blood you should supply blood to so he sets up a blood bank and\nI Know actually that transformed I'm In the Nineteen seventies in in the u._s. um the notion of paying full blood and died out and it's now a whole donate to actually illegal to sell your blood in the U.S but it's just it's just frowned upon not done\nOne of the you know I when I was in college a new lots of college students who are selling their blood for for money just you know for to have some spending cash\nWhere you can still do that but you you what you're doing is\nSelling blood plasma and so you're selling the yellow stuff fifty five percent of liquid in your blood and um\nYeah you can do that the u._s. has got very very generous regulations that house and you can do that can do it twice a week if you want to know other countries on ... plasma during his do it every couple of weeks but um yeah you can and said he's fifty dollars a pop selling a plasma to us so yeah it's a good income stream for other people\nAnd now you write that that the U.S is seen as the whole pack of plasma [laughter] like where it is a cartel of plasma\nWell does that wasn't my phrase that came from someone in the classroom industry but it's it's certainly a global giant and and the selling off last night it's a ...

first it's nine zero doubles us off a nine point so [noise]\n\nIt's science friday I'm Ira Flatow picketing breath through your nose short cuts deep into your brain ... notice anything different other than maybe how the room smelled [noise]\nRecent study suggests that breathing through your nose can be linked to improve memory and that's a neutral on view mouth breeders out there to untangle how olfaction is linked to deep reports the brain\nControlling emotion and memory is Christine is on oh it was just you professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here we're happy to have you do what is so special about breathing through your nose well\nA nose breathing is special because it's how we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing that smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touched the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our ex colonel world\nAnd the way that this information get from\nThese neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems\nInformation relates through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas but in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose into the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus\nUm and what special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved in motion and fear learning and memory so this gives a little faction of sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas\nIn the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling nasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythm can modulate brain activity in these structures\nSo just\nBrain activity in these structures\nSo just the activists breathing through your nose to nose also strange the air is coming in and alert these this pathway on me and point in your brain and say hey I'll figure things happen\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity or not only are responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are the kennel receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe notes yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that adds we breathe\nActivity across the Olympics system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth\nThat rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but uh you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or why and I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special tobacco juice sensory Oregon\nUh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that study it's sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger [noise]\nUm but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth to not do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as who's tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and it helps your taste buds taste what which were actually doing is there a connection there\nRight that is true that is a good point\nUm and that's that's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have sued inside of our mouth [noise]\nUm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word um and it definitely impacts flavors and and taste yes\nI have to talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test this with an F. MRI\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's a very interesting point\nUm we did not use that summer I because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located very very deep almost in the center of the brain uh making them very hard to reach non invasive Lee so we can't record from these areas\nFrom electrodes on the surface of the scalp and functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these limbic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory Olympics structures\n[laughter] if if\nFrom human olfactory and limbic structures\n[laughter] if it falls faction and memory or related do you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell\nA right that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory decline I'm In well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for nerve degenerative disease I think I'm\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggests potential new avenues and direction of research on on these diseases for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in near a degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing it's so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we're looking into and in the lab so do um patients with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nMove sort of something or you're going to be following up right yes and and he knew a degenerative disease in particular\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two um states just by analyzing the shapes of their breathing waveform\n... normally the only I'm going to just throw this talk of some really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animal the brain through our mouth\nYeah you know I I really I think ... ... and I've spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I I mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested\nYou have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Aaron and still live in one that was laid off and on and um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammal that that I can think of do\nPant and parenting is is typically something that involves mouth breathing so dogs pant not only when they're hot but I think also when they're stressed uh cats as well\nAnd I think that's um something interesting about that because mouth breathing is altering activity and the emotion centers and fears centers of the brain so there may be really something behind that", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "26"}
