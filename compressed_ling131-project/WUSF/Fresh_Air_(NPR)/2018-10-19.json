panhandle and emergency calls have moved in recent days from restoring power and cutting down tree limbs to actually responding to widespread reports of looting\nYeah uh it's been some tough days long nights long weeks ahead and just a couple of weeks of course until the mid term elections here in Florida folks in northwest Florida\nMay have a hard time voting will begin this hour with a closer look at the current conditions in the panhandle Scott Kirk men as the station manager at W. cage ISI in Panama City he joins us now\nFrom the bay county emergency operations center Scott the governor is expected there I think in about an hour or so tell us what the general current conditions are here a little bit more than a week after hurricane Michael came a shorter\nWill it it it's just very much surreal um every time that we go out a very hard to kind of imagine that this is this is our home town\nA very hard to kind of imagine that this is this is our home town\nI'm the officials here mentioned pretty early on\nUh before a lot of people went out that it was a little bit disorienting because you're ... you're landmarks that you're used to seeing are nowhere to be found\nAnd um that is the case it's a bit of term is used to a lot that it looks like a bomb went off where it looks like a war zone and um unfortunately that's pretty accurate and we have a lot of military here on on the ground assisting and that doesn't help with the illusion either\nHow widespread are ... our fuel shortages Scott and we're also hearing a lot of folks just don't have access even now to water and food can you bring it up to date on we're the greatest needs are there\nWell there there has been a little bit of fuels fuel shortage we didn't report any widespread fuel shortages obviously in Panama City lent haven area um there's still no power in some places there or the pumps don't work\nUm but there are places around that are beginning to um have gasoline as we go across the bridges we like to refer to it over to Panama City beach and further west there are gas stations that are available there\nUm which really slowing things down is traffic or because everybody has a either going in or going out at a at a high rate of traffic so people are trying to get to the beach where there is food and water\nUm as far as restaurants and gasoline um FEMA and other low or other organizations in this area churches and outside organizations are on the ground that they are providing food daily um some of them just\nLunch and dinner others it's breakfast lunch and dinner or food and water throughout the day\nScott what about the power situation and just the shelter situation given the sheer number of structures and homes that were destroyed if not at least damaged by Michael\nWell let me first say that to the folks that Gulf Power and I can say this for pretty much everybody here in ... county we are we're giving them definitely a two thumbs up they've done a great job\nUm initially Gulf Power told us on Wednesday that a power outages were were huge and it was going to take 'em maybe months before they could get everything up and running to and ... they were having to start from the ground up in order to restore power\nUp the only thing that's on top additional as well um that prevent back then\nAnd so I think that what needs to happen which is what was in the previous says a lot more local control our local government what happened during the implementation which I\nThought so hard on is that they have an all or nothing approach either you cannot regulate them any more than a pharmacy where you ban them and what happened is that so many of our local governments are dealt with a pill mill situation and I'm scared of medical marijuana are banning them where I Know that so many of them would rather just regulate them\nUm and so I think that banning them completely in your communities is unconstitutional and I have that on the record a couple\nOf banks so Wells Fargo and B B and C they refused continued service senior campaign account because you had contributions than it from the medical marijuana industry they were worried that federal regulators would punish them for violating\nFederal drug laws you'd like to ensure that the new\nMedical marijuana industry can bank legally that's a big hurdle for the growing sector and that'll put me points up the difference between\nHow the feds see marijuana and how a growing number of states to Canada and there's a big disconnect and they're big legal hurdles for your vision of how Florida would move forward this way how would you navigate your way through that\nFirst of all when well Barbara first shutdown like count there are various but the fact that us they were not supportive of my platform of expansion\nOf the secondary with the fact that I was taking money from the marijuana industry and the reality is is that politicians and elected officials all across our country have receiving donations from candidates interest of for for years\nAnd so I definitely believe that I Would almost as if they targeted at my campaign but what's done is is giving me even more motivation that I must be on the right track\nIf people like that are coming after me and so I see that this is a huge issue and that and we and the state of Florida and then our constitution and we have to protect our constitution and the people that are operating illegally and are safe\nAnd so I've just got a few things here in our state one is opening up a skate thank a which is more of a depository for our and not only\nFor the our growers in our our ... our license holders but also for our patients and for our doctors because our patients are coming into the defense three is with cash only and that is so dangerous to our patients and then you have all of this cash on hand to our best rates would that makes them a target of giving them the opportunity to have a deposit is\nRight in our own state bank deposits for aids is one aspect to it making sure that our CFO and our office the financial regulation\nOr working with our state chartered banks to give them the type of protection that they need to be operating under here let me just add to the boots\nType of protections that they need to be operating under here let me just have to solve wouldn't wouldn't Florida need a democratic between a real blue wave for some of your ideas to come to fruition [noise] I mean obviously\nThat that is my hope and that's my goal and I talk about all that all the time that I think that the state of tired of the status quo no looking for new innovation\nOn ... and you know I talked with a word\nBut I also know that I'm somebody who has historically worked on both sides of the aisle to get things done other\nThings that I'm saying are not radical the rational and know that I can work with you know now both sides of the aisle to get these things accomplished and I think my situation and what happened with Wells Fargo meeting he'd brought to light how severe this issue it\nAnd that my ideas in my opinion there are are not mine mine alone it's coming from the industry as well and then once we do this we also have the ability to go to DC and to continue lobbying DC but we can't wait for me to take action\nWe need to be leaders here in danger and find the solutions that are Florida\nDriven for our patients and for our legal operations Mickey\nWe recently saw Canada okay recreational use of marijuana would you advocate for to move in that direction it full I did as a agriculture commission\nYeah on a Seventeen or a candidate went to the the legal um I think that that definitely inevitable I think that the legalization of hearing the game is is definitely the path of going to happen within you know whether it's constitutional amendments and twenty twenty four hours from you know a a more moderate legislature and and years to come\nBut I think that what it does is one is a a change in the criminal justice system\nIt take people who are here with the production charges out other criminals that don't allow them to be productive members of our society and then you have an ability to tax the product and make sure that you know we are bringing revenue towards the date that we use for education for for the housing for infrastructure and then it really gets the black\nMarket out of the way you have so many people are still buying on the black market and you have no idea what you're buying you have no idea would be laced with very dangerous and I think that there's a lot of positive that needs to happen but in my my initial focus and making sure that we're getting medical writer because our patients are demanding it today\nFor you to the Democratic candidate for agriculture commissioner here in the state of Florida you can follow our conversation on Twitter at Florida round up is the the social media handled\nThere we've got a lot of issues to

E. P. or local government or ads you know a water from the ... and\nI called her no one to talk to each other and everybody just connected us are that that needs to happen we need to be creating a more centralized a communication between all of our moving parts\nTo it off though making sure that we have a and putting type back into place I mean the writing and and that's only a road on our access to quality water tend to stay with that and you know there should be a combination of you know low that we do and department of transportation to create new roads\nThat have a local government if any that there might be alone at does she do with it that they get paid back over time and\nI can ask them and that leads to be discussing could we all during the same water we all need to make sure that we have in well water for future accomplished feature generations and if we are all working together and then um then we we have a disaster on her hand as in years to come in and out to talk about two and dining away and she had a reusable\nAnd more that they never water supplies and so finding new types of technology and innovation or to be able to capture the water that's being utilized and find new ways to create it to add more usable I'm going forward because of the natural resource that we need to make sure we're protecting\nAnd if you're just tuning in we're speaking with Florida's candidates for agriculture commissioner this hour on the floor to round up right now we're talking with democratic candidates Nikki Fried in a moment we'll talk with her opponent Republican Matt\nCalled while you can follow the conversation right now on Twitter at Florida round up you know Nikki I think the issue on which you differ from your opponent Mr Caldwell representative Paul well see the\nState rep and southwest Florida the issue that you're differ with him the most is on guns your opponent or got an a plus rating from the national Rifle Association defended\nFlorida is gun laws you ah have been sharply critical of where Florida is on guns and the\nCalled for a thorough review of the gun licensing process and you've also been critical of the current outgoing commissioner Adam hunting him and his oversight of this process how would you reach shape the\nLet me ask you as well you are a as it's been said this central casting candidate for this mission year in seventh generation Floridian you come from a family of farmers you know so much about agriculture\nYour opponent is an urban night a lobbyist or do you come from very different backgrounds and so\nUh let me ask you what would you bring to the mission is someone who has grown up in the agricultural world and also\nWhat would you say to critics who feel that you've been to industry friendly particularly environmental groups that have taken issue with some of your votes in the legislature\n[noise] well it is ironic now I'm I'm the or the agricultural candidate some of my primary opponents or criticize

like that but my passion was bagging natural resources is why I ran for office to try to address Everglades issues and water discharges and because the happy\nAnd I think the the progress we've made

the Florida wildlife court or spent three days actually hiking on the trail with them on their second trip\nRepresent other what they ... what what what what do you point to in terms of the successes in environmental policy when you're seeing the blue green algae come through that river and through your\nDistrict yeah yeah it it you know everything that we're dealing with in the bad outcomes on the environment as a result of of years of decisions a hundred and fifty years frankly of bad decisions\nOr you know no one could live in South Florida if it weren't for the flood control project that's the big picture or that I think often gets overlooked\nOr where people live today in Davey in Wellington in West in in Miami lakes and highly uh uh in Nineteen forty seven and during that flood year it was four five six feet under water the Fort Lauderdale courthouse had three feet of water it\nAll of that water today gets sent down the ... river that was by design that is what the flight

agriculture commissioner and the first half hour of the show we spoke with democratic candidate Nikki Fried right now we're speaking with Republican candidate state representative Matt Caldwell\nAt representative called well the issue I think you'd differ with your opponent the most on is gun regulation and gun rights in the state of Florida you have an a plus rating from the national Rifle Association\nYou do not favor a as stringent or an approach toward gun licensing as your opponent Mitt fried can you explain your position I'm\nOn how you would lead the department and I can you also\nTell me where you're at in terms of the criticism that uh your potential predecessor Adam Putnam came in for when it came to the perception that there was\nTo light up or too lenient a process for gun licensing and gun regulation under his leadership your thoughts about all of that\nWell I think it hits on really a false characterization to the idea that I'm a you know against a stringent licensing and and responsibility the same kind of a false dichotomy a though my opponent is pro marijuana and I'm I'm anti marijuana or some some ideas there in between\nUh you know when it comes to the concealed weapons permit program but no one should get a license if they don't qualify for it and if you have an employee\nOr who is not doing their job they should be fired pure and simple uh that appears to be what happened under commissioner buttons watching twenty Thirteen but\nUh if I have the opportunity to service commissioner day one of transition or we're going to review that entire program to make sure I'm satisfied safeguards have been put in place so that that kind of scenario I Can't play itself out again in the future you know my\nEntire legislative career I've prided

unable to to adequately describe or what their views are on that and and how they're willing to to fight to defend them that it's really fundamental responsibility\nAnd how they're willing to to fight

measures\nAnd increase the age to buy a rifle they're Twenty one band bump stocks and and so forth why did you vote against that particular bell\nWell for two reasons one uh some of those provisions I

five five or tweet at science friday but first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like\nThen on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support behind a U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled here with the story as well as other short subjects in science is on there are fine a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a service that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker\nThis is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise over time then they would use that money to go back to people like you and me I was actually in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimated it would start at about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon want to write a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damages for these companies\nIt's the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\n... ah actually has a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been a head of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem they've had researchers who helped all through the eyepiece tc report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuel years ago and ...\nSo being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers saying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another you know and make us look good sort of thing\nNewest shot he tries to take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... both President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nFor heart the M ward definitely worth because there were former soldiers fired from the military operations combat targeted killing for the military of a foreign power Saturday on weekend edition from NPR News joined us for weekend edition tomorrow morning\nFrom eight to ten right here on to us to\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section who's not unusual but what is unusual there's been a number of seats sections happening\nAll over the world listen to this to worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent in the past Fifteen Years and in the United states\nSaid in the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se used by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick what are the effects on mothers and babies\nAnd what did you ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about she section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number\nA four four seven to for eight to five five you can tweet us ... shy fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that to laugh at series he's also professor of midwife midwifery\nAt the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us for that alec enemy\nThank you tell us philanthropy series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over use the sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... bird after they've had their first ... so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um as a dairy and we're way\nOver last talking about over ... visits to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there [noise]\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but that you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm of this part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the problems [noise] exactly\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have his his area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... is his area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are there are small bit serious risk a boat with the immediate surgery and\nOur small bit serious risk a boat with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the score and still birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and\nWhy not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and in countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do the dairy and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to to stay at at the un said there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nWant to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and watch the surgeons are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics\nAnd gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned she's sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you ever ... have you seen it in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of bias and area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nThe tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer um the truth is and said I think that we as health care providers need to um\nRealize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise and sit there and deliver right here in the U.S when you\nSay health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and [noise]\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetrician um they're the ones who make the recommendation first maryann I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nOn it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics that there are other things that put pressure possibly an obstetrician um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on him make quicker decision to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on\nPatients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to them\nAll I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman is giving birth and it's very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having him ... birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to\nAnd but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her and her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday [noise]\nIra thank you for your own guns\nI actually had an emergency C section at thirty why do we um and I think for that for that [noise] um but when I got pregnant for a second\nTime I really wasn't given the option of ... after the section of I kind of had to\nDo all that it um education and he said on so I had to look at what they I got to look at rates are the very end maybe you've written in the ... and um it really was up to me it was\nUm like my provider\nAll that you want to have the time I was like oh sure I like that but I wasn't getting their risk and benefits are able to make at truly at it\nThat says um and so I think that um I was able to\nActually win that Senate rain heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and my God I really ... them with that and I was able to see that but I like what a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had to retail\nRecord to play songs from rally cry that's coming on that expedition of cue at eight o'clock right after science friday\nYou're on to us at the Poynter Institute an honors NBC nightly news anchor Lester Holt and former New York times publisher Arthur Sulzberger junior at the end you will get you on the ... on December eighth\nOr tickets are available and information online at Poynter

boulders smoke free pub at nine thirty\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of chief sections and what that means for women's health\nI guess or doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land the slanted series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp on us look at decreasing says area and and and one of the things that they have recommended is wet the u._k. does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have the midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that ... was a so seeded with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections until one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of births are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and\nUh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives\nSo that's not a causation it is an association type steady but it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we knew how to model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\n[noise] ah twenty going you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital ideal and after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence that the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications for scenarios and focus\n... and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces arrogant and focus very narrowly on primary sit there and I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using\nScience and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definition for progress in labor or old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor the newer more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focus on improving access on and a and M. enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom this book you were at the Beth Israel and I would do if you were only from so phone down here in Boston so does this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less what you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's there and delivery rapes may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work and the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter vets relativism services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus the typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report holiday\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money are wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more per se is dairy and to really um level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time\nAnd you're you're going to\nIssue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large physicians are obstetrician do not get a a vastly different amount of money for that channel delivery than a scenario delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients I'm and probably reimbursement itself doesn't influence a lot\nI Believe reimbursement itself doesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a dummy embarrassment is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because of the length of stay\nYou know it's good to swear in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I hadn't male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just asked if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that as questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't\nYou know push the baby out that generally and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think that's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute a tone of your own would I Would\nI Would completely agree with you that\nOne of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her and and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is\nI Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... and are fully fully disgusting\nAnd Tony what about this ... who's charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how the baby is born\nOn the person who gives birth to the baby becomes a parent's uh after that happened um it's no less are no more ... regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery I'm certainly makes you just as much as a mother on as having a vegetable\nFor very free weights and finally Kennedy professor midwifery at Yale School of nursing Tony going vice chair of
