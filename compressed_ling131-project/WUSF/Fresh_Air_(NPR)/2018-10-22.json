Israel confide in secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet and numerous scams and hustles jak has played by Richard ... grand each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nThe on the whole my friends with the [noise]\nBy accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from\nA criminal activity Austrian Boulder trips crime assertion [noise] I mean [noise] embellish [noise]\nDocuments [noise]\nLiterary letter writer [noise] real ... [noise]\nIs if you're not understanding the world of elite\nCollectible literary articles that was really beautiful pieces of paper\nI'm selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the rock because I get a better response was if you told me about it [noise]\nThe only one was that [laughter]\nBut listen McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nBut I wouldn't call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent at an dramatic role that you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um\nI think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to see me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when\nThe right in the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal drafted yet and you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene and part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do grow sat comedy just as men can and it really wasn't a point of a a okay and then\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of injected into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to term it in for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appealed to me does seem funny and kind of\nLike if the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because we are things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about\nOh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that cause the second half of my question [laughter] what's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality\nDo grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality by doing gross out scenes because your money is really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it\nWas really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for\nIs I'm insults [laughter]\nInsulting to do that and I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your a teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other couple the Leslie manpower odd couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do he didn't say All right you know when I said was that we need to keep an extra ... tubes because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he when he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine\nLanguage for me to relay what these do not balls to me\nUnless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul Bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone just\nReally scaring me this is what happens in your corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know through you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise]\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] and never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I I\nDidn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before [noise] yes I've had uh\nImprov insults before\n[noise] [noise] yes I've had a\nConventionally have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um\nCharacters that you know I think in the heat or especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of ... chair people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authorities so it was a big part of that character and you're very aggressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\n[noise] there is a fun to it I mean it would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your heart sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest as Melissa McCarthy she stars

I. E. A.\nDot org [noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off when we're talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] it when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there is this element there was always one\nOne guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you had any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter]\nJust every time or something in that vein\nAnd especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise] so in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them nothing\nBe quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person's so there is that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler [noise] God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy just to have to take his shirt off and like and I would you vote for him and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what\nFirst of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a snake is there a home body there was a comedy club owner like happened I was watching sang times oh my God I saw\nThe light oh the ever present or not to ever not be seated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man\nI wouldn't flashes like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nFeeling other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager\nKind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up 'cause I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I [noise]\nI got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I Believe now that I truly didn't know\nSo you don't want to help women who has [noise]\nDidn't know [noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making the three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it now it's a thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with\nQuirks and eccentricity use and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for a female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] I say I'm Still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why didn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just couldn't I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise] every little\nInch I Will take every centimeter forward I'll take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so

[noise]\nWants to hold my friends with that [noise]\nFind myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from\nCosts criminal activity ... subscribers or should I mean unless you [noise]\nDocument [noise]\nBeautiful she can check out\nLiterary letter writer [noise] real trucks will mother just\nAs if you're not understandings of world of elite collectible literary artifacts disposal thrilling to be full ... pieces of paper to go with\nI Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out there that in Iraq and told him the wrong because I get a better response because if you total [noise]\nDealing with her [laughter] and\nIt wasn't McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very\nSo congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic dinner way\nBut I Want to call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nUm I think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh I Do realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the searching people at each performance\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us I guess is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSomething else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] when the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yeah them you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like ...\nTo fancy bridal dressing yeah them you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and then ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of injected into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it because we're things like that do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about\nOh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately [noise] even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nAnd interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter] what's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross had seen your months really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended\nBut it wasn't intended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people [noise]\nMelissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults [laughter]\nInsulting no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they were all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other couple the Leslie manpower rod couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that might come with an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car did you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hit him said already we're already said was\nIt's like that you do hit him say All right you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra hour and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he well he said to me was he called me\nWhat language Catherine language and show me how to relate what they do not bald to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake couple a bank commercial that's what you look like your bank commercial couple none of this talk it productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in a job with my ... bone\nJust really scaring me this is what happens in your corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was there with you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it just goes back on and on with more over the top insult if that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that and the person was sitting with with that said for watching you say it he said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory hedging improv insults before [noise]\n[noise] yes I've had a\n... internally I have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that is very aggressive detective um\n[noise] there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your heart sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday I'm Terry Gross and this is

we left off when we're talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex was one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nTo one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\nWith the with the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you had any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter]\nJust every time or something in that vein\nAnd especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly each other now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it [noise]\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I Would always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who [noise] who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off like and I would do vote and they're talking about like wow you have no takers and\nIt would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what\nFirst of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the actors if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is\nThey're going to play you a stage is there to somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened I was watching sang times oh my God so\nI Know there's the light oh air and all the ever present or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men I Want to flash it like I Am\nYes and when that light flashes it's literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explode it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the feeling other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of a room shot like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act in material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good role because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get\nGood roles [noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I've never mind it how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making the three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it now it's a thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was\nReally blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like Carl [laughter] than I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why didn't she\nJust randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why did she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting or morass Nader mental behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\n[noise] every little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and\nThe fact that is is becoming less acceptable\nYou know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be ... you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in real life your strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or after a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target\nIt drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nHilary Swank is a two time Oscar winner and it's been a long time since you were introduced to hurt and boys don't cry in her new film she plays someone you know well a daughter trying to talk her parents into entering assisted living home that are we supposed to talk about about the role she understand very well coming up on cue from here on public radio international\nDammit cue from the CBC counting your way at age here on devil us that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Tampa", "day": "22"}
