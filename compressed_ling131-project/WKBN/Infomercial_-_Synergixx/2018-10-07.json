upstate Michael church in cat field one day\nThe earth comes to an end everybody on earth died that goes to church that comes in and said I Want the men to make two lines\nOne line with the men\nThat dominated their women on earth\nAnd the other line for the men that were dominated by their women oh so I watch the women to do with St Peter\nAll said and done that extra time God looks the women are gone and they are to light the light of the men who were pushed around by their wives was a hundred miles long\nOn the line of the men that dominated their women was only one man God's got a little angry and said\nYou man should be ashamed of yourself I created you in my image and gave you dominion\nOver all creation and you're all whipped by your wives look at the only one of my sons that stood up and maybe proud\nLearn from him gel there my son how did you manage to be the only one in that line and said I don't know my wife told me to stand here\nAre scriptures today are obviously about marriage marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman and almighty God\nIt is not about one dominating the other is not about one within the other marriage is not about control in fact in my experience as a priest control is the number one reason marriages fail\nMarriage is about law it's about children it's about family gets about God\nAre scriptures today give us an ideal to strive for\nThe first rating for genesis guy decides that is not good for the man to be alone so it creates a woman for the sake of companionship and the two are equals and argued night at\nThis one that lasted bone in my bone and flush him I flash this one shall be called a woman for out of her man this one has been taken\nThat is why it man leaves his father and mother and claims to his wife and the two of them become one flash so they are one unit not selfish this has no role in marriage because selfishness breeds control\nIn marriage each partner is looking out for the other

negative\nIn family kids witness relationships for the first time they usually grow up imitating what they witness\nIf kids witness dad controlling mom did they think that that's the way it is in marriage if they witness mom and dad in a loving caring and forgiving relationship then they will imitate that that's just the way it is\nBut remember the scriptures give us an ideal to strive for\nToday's gospel of Jesus is teaching his teaching the revealed word of God we all recognize there are times in marriages fail and that's just the way it is and when that happens so be it\nKnow Jesus as a teacher steps aside to make room for Jesus the healer\nYou remember how Jesus treated the woman taught in adultery is in those days that women cutting adultery were taken to the gates of the city and we're stoned to death\nBut Jesus said that he who is without sin be the first to cast a stone single parent can provide a very loving home just as much as a married couple can and sometimes even better ...\nMarriage is not about me it's about the other\nIs especially about the children who are watching every move parents may\nSo don't dominate and do the ... just loving the

supplies energy to your lungs to your liver\nSo needless to say we all of this energy\nThat case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten in your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential I mean you could eat sardines and Mac rolling peanuts\nWe're co Q. ten comes from but it's\nNot going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just do you told you already have to quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two degrees to co Q. ten and the reserve patrol now why he's proud of this cutting edge combinations purity calls it they're huge super boost formula what can you do for people\nWell its energy I mean the combination of these two incredible nutrients resveratrol and co Q. ten in fact\nOne of my students called the advantage I like that so I adopted the term\nIt's combining to amazing nutrients unto themselves which a spectacular but when you combine them indeed this spectacular this if we can call it that this is enhanced this advantage this cardiovascular advantage the cardiovascular benefits benefits to your brain function and cognitive performance\nIt even is involved in healthy aging and it's important for supporting immune function it's great for your skin it's great for energy and enduring an aerobic capacity and as we said before\nIt supports normal ... activity throughout your body\nAnd I think this is the ultimate combination not remember mark as we said the energy in your body is converted by co Q. ten add to that the benefits of resveratrol this combination it is on the ... and indeed you get as my students said this real advantage\nInteresting we're talking with Dr Allen president now that you present something more about the consequences of being co Q. ten deficient\nYeah well that's really interesting you know one of the assignments I gave my class awhile ago was to create a co Q. ten deficiency questionnaire in other words if you're going to give a patient a questionnaire to determine whether or not they had a co Q. ten deficiency what questions would be on the questionnaire\nWell the first thing everybody agreed on in class was a feeling of being run down feeling for tea you know I hear him running out of gas I got an energy crunch my batteries are law you know like that\nSo basically a lack of energy a lack of stamina and remember we need a constant supply of energy to live and to thrive and co Q. ten is the key nutrient involved in energy production\nBut the point is you don't have to have these symptoms to supplement keep in mind that co Q. ten is crucial for your general energy production\nAnd as we said it diminishes as we age\nAgain we're talking with Dr Alan ... no I Want you to have a
