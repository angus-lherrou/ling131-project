H. for but there are other\nElements that are being produced in the area that I just suggest that in their liquid hydrocarbons like eh thing entertain butane eyes so butane and propane some natural gas lines as well there's not a lot of heavy oil air but those different elements are used in different process these across a\nCross our our economy the thing is that\nFeedstock for plastics butane an accelerant used and aerosols propane of course is used as a a home heating element used in agriculture as well and those are products that are being produced in high volume now\nIn our region we've gone from you know producing a small fraction of what we use in our own individual states to now producing more than twenty five percent of America's\nNatural gas supply of Ohio West Virginia and Pennsylvania it is an incredible journey\nAnd less than ten years and it's made a big difference the affordability now I Know in Pennsylvania alone our utility rates have dropped anywhere from fifty seven to eighty one percent because of what's happening here on their purchase natural gas supplies\nBecause of of what we've done it shall\nTip so but the genesis of all of this is fracking right because you go back and and you frack to release these liquids and to be a little natural gases and that has broken down from there is that correct\nDad I'll tell you that the major innovation\nWas that that started in the Barnett Shale in Texas is the the study and work and innovation that that came into play with being able to turn a drill bit horizontally all of our development that we've had a natural gas\nAnd oil has been primarily vertically drilled out today we can go in and turn it drove and horizontal fracking plays an important role in the fact that it that once you get the the the well bore drilled then you can fracture the rock strata the solid rock strata\nThat can release the molecular uh\nThe supplies of natural gas or natural gas liquids to that well bore fracking we've been doing that since the Nineteen forties in both Ohio and Pennsylvania and\nWe're doing it with far more precision today and then a lot of advancement there\nBut the real technology breakthrough that we had was the ability to turn to drill horizontally and instead of interfaith scene that rock strata with just the vertical penetration we now and go two or three miles out or in any given direction in that same strategy to release hydrocarbons to the ...\nThat is amazing so you basically can find out where the ... the sweet spot is and you can drill from one sport boy did that directional drill will take you there\nYeah and are well ... to date in as you probably know instead of having a single well with a single road or to single pipeline for every single well location today we're drilling you know as many as you know a dozen or more wells on a single location so well while our sites are a little larger\nFrom a conservation standpoint it's a lot it's a lot more conservation friendly and that you have a single location with let's say up to a dozen wealthy oven doesn't wells was one road and one pipeline\nAnd the supplies of energy coming off of that one side are enormously as compared to where we would have gone before some of the natural gas wells\nIn Pennsylvania today are producing enough gas to feel a hundred and Seventy five thousand homes up a single well it's an incredible\nIncredible breakthrough that we've had and it's taken us from a period of tight supply and high price back in two thousand eight and nine to appear today of abundance and affordability that's generation or this will be there so long outlive my life I think we're still in the first inning of a ... game well\nAll right we're talking with Dave Spiegel Meyer and uh Dave who's the head of the Marcellus Shale coalition and I've got kind of a two part question your first of all I Want to remind you they have shale insight coming up October twenty third\nThrough the twenty fifth if you're at all interested that set the David L Lawrence convention center very easy to find you go to Mark Scholz coalition dot org and it's an easy click through your click there and you register and you are in\nThat is a twenty third twenty fourth and twenty fifth convention in Pittsburgh now\nAnd when we think about the Marcellus you've been talking about that\nUm the the two part question is is the Utica as good as Marcellus and the cracker plant that you have in Pittsburgh is there anything like that coming to Ohio in the near future and the third part of that is do these produced long term jobs\nYeah and that's that's a great great question Dan first of all I think that uh\nUh the Utica the first part of your questions ... is good as the Marcellus I think time will tell certainly eastern Ohio has probably been more prolific on the unit capital we've got a number of operators now in Pennsylvania\nSpending a significant amount of capital in the year to go we think it's as good as the Marcellus but I think time will tell\n'em the facility in western Pennsylvania actually it's in ... along the Ohio River or near beaver Pennsylvania I Would tell you that that\nThere are six thousand construction jobs there there's thirty one active cranes on that site today it's about a five year bill to six billion dollars and it will employ six hundred folks permanently wants to develop well six hundred doesn't sound like a panacea\nI Would tell you I think it's the downstream jobs that are generated as a result of that\nUh you know we produce many of our plastic products\nIn this region but we transport run I say this region within seven hundred miles\nOf of Pittsburgh uh Seventy percent of the plastic products are produced in America but all the feedstock for that comes from the Gulf Coast states today will now have that feedstock coming from Pennsylvania and I believe from Ohio and ultimately West Virginia's well you've asked the third part of your question\nWhat's in store for Ohio where there's a company called P. T. T. that has\nProposed the site and believe in Belmont county or to build a facility similar to what shell has built\nUm or his building in western Pennsylvania does take a long time to build five or six years\nBut I Believe the supplies of liquid hydrocarbons in Ohio\nWill be a catalyst for Ohio having that same type of economic opportunity and benefit\nComing their way and I think coming their way fairly soon I think you'll see an announcement within the next year that I mean Pete duties already said they're very interested very a willing to move forward but I think the the final straw them beginning to turn dirt there is the is the test and I think that'll come soon\nAnd does all of this they're literally spending multi millions of dollars just in research to see if they should build this crazy how much money they put out one more thing here are the pipe that you're using in Marcellus as much of this coming from our place up here a dollar Rick\nSome of it is certainly um I'm Italian steel manufacturing in our region I'm Valerie go up and up and Cleveland there's some steel supplied door bond over near Harrisburg coating a lot of that pie but would tell you it's a huge economic winner for\nThe steel man what's left of our steel manufacturing base in the region US Steel still produces a lot of ah what they call wind pipe\nThere are some different uh diameter pipes that we still get out of Canada and I I Would tell you that some people have asked me questions about the tariff issue and set some impact on us because of the fact that a lot of our or some of our still manufactures don't make all the diameter pipe that's used for\nUm for case you know well they're different diameter pipes that we use to protect the strata the ground in the end the freshwater people they would just drill single hole there are five different layers of steel and cement casing that are used to protect our fresh ground water supplies\nAnd those different layers of pipe are different sides diameter so there are some of those diameter pipes that aren't necessarily available from a U.S operator and that's where we're working with those offers develop that pipe but we also get some of that from Canada\nTo take thirty seconds again just to say what you're doing it but ... you know the the pellets to manufacture or are those like a a pellet or corn belt or something that would go in\nBecause I Am going to tell you where the jobs are\nIn our next segment and it starts with the segment that I just had on\nUnemployment is at eight fifty year low job openings a record high workers are enjoying more opportunities than they have had in years\nOh to be young Americans have more choices know about where to live where to work it's a matter of going out and just grabbing it\nAnd folks don't you admit you have to come to a conclusion this is the Trump effect this is the conservative effect\nAnd you're going to have a chance to both the Democrats out and I would think that you would do it in huge numbers you can't vote for the Democrats\n[noise] what do you think about that [noise] give me a call [noise]\n\nYou have an old car taking up space be a hero and support our nation's veterans by donating your car to the Purple Heart foundation your car donations to the Purple Heart foundation helps all veterans get the benefits they've earned and deserve donate today\nAnd I hardly Purple Heart dot org\n\nOn news radio five Seventy W.

thinking to myself here here we have it's not perfect it's not great for guns down I mean we're we're still you know down there where we don't have a high of median salary like to do in Pittsburgh and these other cities but you know what it's close to us\nAnd people that want the opportunity can go other places it has been pretty good for us\nAnd we live in a in a nice area where you can it's an hour to drive the Pittsburgh it's an hour drive to Cleveland there's a lot of people in these major cities that actually commute and hour and a half two hours to get to work back and forth people can do that if they need to you know have those type of opportunities here\nAnd I think it's going to continue to grow\nBut if we have this\nUm where where they want more regulation they want to basically to find me everything higher taxes is a proven fact\nCERN should raise the taxes your tax revenue instead of dropping\nOut here so what do you think the Democrats would get out of this if in fact they were able to go back and say okay\nDonald Trump has been neutered we have a chance now to bring him up for impeachment charges\nWhat did they gain by this if in fact our economy goes south you know what I mean yesterday we lost a lot on the show today it's back up we are going to have these corrections here but for the most part the economy has been great and that changes a lot of things doesn't\nIt sure does but you know what their message out there is we got to make everything fair\nI don't know where people are grown up but life is not there you go to work hard it's not a zero sum game everybody has the opportunity to actually come out of winter yeah but\nYou have to put it in a sweat equity to do it\nYou know and it's out there for the taking into I think that there's a lot of people that think like you and I and I think even from the Democratic persuasion because they realize that you know what this has been a better two years than it was under the Obama administration\nI mean it was ... you know essentially you know the Republican stymied the Obama administration but I thought on good grounds because we did not want to turn over everything to this Obamacare which\nI I don't think it's been good at all I mean by any stretch of the imagination yeah there's some people that are insured but there's an awful lot of people out there that had insurance that we're self employed that can no longer afford it\nI'm One of those and I'll tell you why buy insurance and this was two years ago was going to sit there just for family for the Eighteen thousand a year just for the insurance\nFor the twelve thousand eight hundred dollar adoptable which means I wouldn't be paying out of pocket close to thirty thousand dollars for the insurance company will pay a dime now if anybody thinks that's reasonable off of all I'd like to meet him because yeah\nTo me that's not\nWell how do you go make that kind of money I mean because uh you know that's after tax money uh and you've got to go back and pay that kind of money I mean I just found out just with a small injury I have I mean our deductible is um you know ... it's out of pocket before you have to stop paying it adoptable about ten thousand also\nSo I mean it's it's insurance we've got to get a cost regulation on these medical bills because I think that the hospitals\nHave basically built these um [noise] well I mean you go to a hospital and they're gorgeous and they're beautiful\nI does it have anything to do with really delivering the healthcare\nI couldn't agree with you more you go to a hospital that's not under construction yeah they'll go somewhere where you're not tripping over stuff and it's like we just want basic care we just want to be taken care of I don't want the room to be luxurious on there to sit there and hail up and move out you\nGot it hey thank you the best of luck to you Tim you take care now than that's Tim\nAll right let's go to James he is in war and on five Seventy WPN and I'm going to talk about Donald Trump here and whether or not we're going to make this change James uh where are you going here with your vote here are you going to you voting for change\nOur percent I and I also agree with you\nI I like to simplify conversations go yeah\nI'm ... doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result as we know is madness mhm we've been under democratic rule for forty plus years and what has happened to the valley\nWhere these jobs that Pittsburgh is getting wherever the jobs that Cleveland is getting where are these jobs that Columbus has had for twenty or Thirty years where why are we still where we are\nSo the bottom line is if you're a diehard Democrats and you're just going to vote democratic okay God Bless ya but for those who have an open mind towards ... let's see what happens\nLet's put some new people and if it doesn't work out we vote them out and you put someone else and I don't understand why it's so difficult to understand the very basic concepts\nNow you're it already ... I'm Sorry go ahead I'll just jump on to a point here too you know if you think about whom we have in the state house we have John Boccieri and we have ...\nAnd we have other Democrats that have gone down there and they are set in their in such a small minority I don't think anybody really listens to them in the majority they don't have to do they\nKnow absolutely not one party rule where Republican or Democrat is not good\nYou have to keep them fighting for your vote and we have been in this recession in the ... valley for forty years I've blessed to be able to travel around\nDown the Columbus up to Cleveland now Cleveland has a different story but down to Columbus other other cities where I'm saying just go to the sick\nWhere's our construction hairs are gross you know where our jobs they don't exist and we don't we vote the same people in office over and over and over again you know and you have to ask yourself what is it or not\nYou know what I mean you know we we get some things around here that are that are nice you know we've got some improvements but I was over at the Firestone golf tournament I was lucky enough to be able to go over there because they allow the veterans in and\nI went over there and I've watched as I came back as we went down to twenty four from a Firestone and you see that Akron Canton is a different looking city to they are on the upswing are they not\nAnd you look at what we've done here in northeast Ohio in\nSpecial Youngstown warring same people Democrats totally rule this place and you have to ask yourself what are you really get them from this\nI have a buddy that lives down in Belmont county and I listen to that previous segment yup and uh that would tell you what they're blowing up down there they have the construction jobs the gas and oil jobs it's they're all over and they can't keep up\nWhere where where's that here I Am really why are we so far behind and I just leave that question out there for people I don't care you know what what your political is a fairly Asian is just ask basic questions goes right over to Akron take a ride down the Belmont county\nCould ride down there Columbus go to Pittsburgh why are we so far behind yeah and I'm very basic question\nAnd and so much blight I mean I was driving down Forbes Avenue\nOr in Pittsburgh over last Saturday and ah you know or you go by the treasury I may have and they have the University of Pittsburgh and they have Carnegie and then you see the neighbors the neighborhoods are still pretty much populated you know you've got people that live in the city of Pittsburgh\nAnd it is a viable are of course they have their violence and they have there I'm sure that they they have everything every large city has but there is definitely something going on outside the Youngstown area that we are not experiencing we really are agree\nWith you a hundred I agree with you a hundred percent and we just we have to change our mindset and critics stepped in the

this uh the state always vote for conservatives and that is a gym out in Lake City Texas a gym yeah Hi hey Jim good to have your long\nTalk and when you listen I was just up in Ohio I live here now I moved from Warren, Ohio about two years ago oh is that right yeah I'm halfway between Houston, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico Galveston\nAnd ah [noise] in a way called when I graduated from a downstate in a way back in eighty two\nI was only one I was eighty one so we're probably at the same time\nYep and I always like that call the but the point is is that that's a Fifth Avenue that goes by the by the stadium yup\nThat's deplorable you know for a university that should be pristine you've got is coming in from out of state and everything else and they're going to judge a university based on that\nNow how how how long has it been since you've been here though\nAre just two years okay but\nDo you know you're talking about when you're coming down from ... auditorium down past the stadiums are you mean going going north toward the golf course is that words bad is or what what what they were used particularly talking about this bad\nOkay I'm going to probably have my streets mixed up but it's the one near the parking deck for a year they're going up the hill towards a towards the stadium\nYou know you're you're on the right you're on the right track but I don't know if you've seen it now but they go to Bali or they've got to a baseball field and attract field across from the stadium did you see that yeah I did see that when you enter a nice so that's improved and they've done a lot with the neighborhood as you go west\nBut it is you're right if you go up into stem auditorium that neighborhood up there uh it gets a brown what park but it's not terrible is it I mean I don't think that's the worst area\nWell I thought I thought this the parking deck and I wish I could remember the streets are\nLow you're ... you're on the right to your own fifth yeah everyone\nYeah there's a a Taco Bell or something across the street right right\nRight yeah and there's some older some houses down there that are dilapidated\nI mean they've really come a long way since you know and that's it really does look nice with was impressive what the new building and everything that they have but I just thought that street really needed effects new and the other day she talked about jobs and expertise is a ton of jobs down here in Houston\nYeah that's what I that's what I hear I was down in Dallas uh two years ago and I notice all the construction but what's your lifestyle walk down there in the lake city taxes you're pretty close to Houston\nOh yeah I'm only about ah [noise] well if you want to his new expands my backup that expands a lot and if you want to go right to the border of Harris County on line about ten miles away but to get actually downtown Houston I'm about twenty five miles away and I'm about twenty five miles north of Galveston\nYeah what's the what's the main problems that you have in a place like Lake City taxes or or or people lake\nCity league say like baseball league mhm are you saying lake\n... oh you oh you oh you're in league city Lake City okay we did a misprint up there but what does this what's the main problems that people talk about on TALK radio down there\nCorrect correct and read her things aren't happening around here just to answer everybody's question is because the leadership we don't have any leadership around here\nThat's why none of the businesses are opportunities are gravitating here so we made their structured as it's not an overnight thing it's not a microwave solution but it can happen we can make this area of great I like it used to be fifty years ago\nI got to tell you the truth I Am kind of lost as to why\nAre we are not thriving here uh you know your point to some of the good things that we have at Youngstown State but that kind of feeds off of itself too because the kids that do stay home and go to the Youngstown State they typically have to leave to find a job or career they want\nSo you know in a way we're subsidizing people to go to Youngstown State for somebody else and that crazy like\nBut it all comes back that leadership and that's the reason he is yeah I don't know why it's a leadership state government is designed and created an environment for business to grow and to be created in our area not to run it\nNot to control it and not to you know ... it's it's designed to create the environment and that hasn't been a created and even if people wanted to come in is pulling teeth to get anything done\nAnd I don't know I don't know ... is anybody knocking on to do Brown's door or on the county commissioners door and saying I've got a project and that these three these poor people are standing in their way or you know if you go up and see the mayor in Warren is he's stopping people from coming in no no\nNo it's the perception that have been created over the years um and and I I I remember years ago I I I Would try to break businesses and they are and they they run out right away and call me on the cell phone on eighty\nSo you know it's that the perception for years and it's not just one person it's that group of people here that just want a job but you don't want they don't want to create an opportunity down they want a job\nNow and go the last two things that have happened here or you know with an Wyo corporation with uh the\nThe indictment of Dominic ... with the indictment of the former mayor with the indictment of ... most things don't help our area and it almost seems like we're going back to the old ways that we have done things even though I Know we're not the perception is we are\nRight and that's what I'm Talking about we need to change that recession perception by changing the leadership get Columbus to recognize us and then they will help us a lead people that they might know or opportunities or foreigners and that you know to
