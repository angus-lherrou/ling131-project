fifties all next week you know I thought we'd get them a little bit in depth you know after talking to\nRichard Cordray he saw a yes vote on issue one and uh some of the things that they propose that you're saying a yes vote an issue one will return thousands of Ohioans to the workforce\nIt it makes them misdemeanors without any jail time but think about the ... you know they're they're trying to sell this to the people that are for a she won or trying to sell this to be able to get people treatment and what this amendments actually doing is it's\nIt's removing completely the teeth of any judge or anybody to be able to get these people into treatment let's remember that they're addicted\nSo if there is no penalty for them not going being forced to go being part of a drug\nCourt or anything like that if there is no motivation for them\nTo get the help they need to get off these drugs they're going to continue doing it they're going to continue breaking into houses when we're at work to feed their\nAddictions they're going to continue or you just saw this or this or human trafficking arrest a there's a lot of addiction involved with that um I I can go on and on with this um it it completely takes away a judge's ability\nTo to hold any type of incentive at all for these people to\nGet health will one day and let's just talk about the very basics of the drug task forces how do you think\nHow do you think we work on cases you know you get somebody with possession or with buying it a ... they're looking at some time even if it's just jail time and not the penitentiary they're able to give you the information for us to work our cases all the way up to the top and get the bigger fish\nSo any technology moves that take you take me through that permitted so for example if you arrest someone and they are possessing heroin\nOr possessing some kind of a controlled substance than your folks would put the pressure on them by saying look you need to give up these people because if you don't you're facing a really long sentence we may be able to moderate that ... you're listening to\nThe it's the very first thing you do when somebody gets arrested with drugs not only to not only do you do that but you try and get them help you try and even before they're sent senior trying to get them into some type of treatment to get that person better and that's the whole premise of the drug court getting them into the drug court where they get treatment\nAnd then they could actually once they've completed the drug court which by the way it's been very successful uh but once they've country a completed that drug court the actual charge on them originally\nGets dismissed this takes away all penalties until the third time ... there's there's no incentive for for a drug addict or anybody to get off work to get or or to get home\nAnd let me get through this year let me get through this what you're going to see on the ballot now\nI'm the second part it says it mandates that criminal offenses of obtaining possessing or using any drugs such as ... know heroin methamphetamine cocaine LSD and other controlled substances\nCannot be classified as a felony so all of these would be a misdemeanor if you possess these it does does it say does it say anything I I I don't even know if the amount is um is important\nBut basically it's kind of an open ended thing it says if you possess them it's a misdemeanor\nCorrect so that that in itself is a pretty big oh it says that would prohibit jail time as a sentence for obtaining possessing or using such drugs until an individual's third defense which you touched on so you don't want\nThat individual have to motivate them to get better especially if a judge that this person goes in front of needs to make a decision with this individual to either\nGet them help or or you're gonna you're gonna go away for a year\nTo you know I Can't tell you how many times I've talked to parents who've had kids that have been addicted when they said the first good night's sleep they got is when they were in jail\nBecause they knew they wouldn't be taking that crap right you know and risking their lives it this is incredible uh this uh this is very sad that this issue even has to be considered\n... and ... all that's involved I I I don't\nKnow one law enforcement officer one judge anybody in the criminal justice system that could could possibly think this makes any sense at all\nNo care of our it says a prohibitive we we got through part of this prohibit the jail time and here's the other thing to folks and this is possessing or using any drugs until the third offense within twenty four months Soviet to offenses within twenty four months you could lay off of it and then you can really start over again it seems pretty odd\nIn that sense of the IRS the other major I think that we're talking with your of jury green I think that most of us are pretty much on the same page we really don't like us to shovel amendments because they're so hard to undo so that's really the big strike against it right off the bat isn't\nScares me is the voter that that that just goes to the pole in is uninformed and and\nAnd you and I are are tuned into many of these issues and we know about him but but it's just like anything else when you see you know when I see this\nCommercial on this issue on his back by a lot of money\nAnd a ... in people that are that don't know don't understand and think oh my God they're they're gonna they're they're pushing this whole issue I Know that we're going to get them ... and we're going to get them help what's exactly what we're doing right now only now you're removing any type of incentive or any type of in full authority\nWith the courts with probation they are allowed to violate their probation\nThey're allowed to violate a their parole there are a lot as long as it's not a new crime that's a felony they can violate or any of the judges orders\n'em in and they're not allowed to be sent back to the penitentiary\nYeah and you really have to read in depth to find just because of the language on the ballot you're not going to see it you're going to see sentences such as I'm referring to now here is the fourth point\nIt allows that individual convicted of obtaining possessing or using any such drug prior to the effect of data the amendment\nTo ask a court to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor regardless of whether the individual has completed this happens so they're selling that on the basis that you now have a misdemeanor on your ... and you can go back to work now that's not a bad idea is it\n[laughter] you got to go a long way to get there yeah you do ... I mean think about that I mean ... and maybe in the perfect situation uh yeah I Would buy that but a ... this is this is terrible on so many fronts I Can't say enough against it I mean it's\nYou know here's another point Rick it would require any available funding based on projected savings to be applied to stay to administer rated rehabilitation programs and crime victim funds so they're going to take this money that you normally would put in prisons you're going to put these into rehabilitation programs\nThat sounds like a just a you know doing what in the wind or Tibet money\nWell ... ... and that's like anything else we don't it it it it's just saying that it's going to do it but we don't know exactly where it's going to go how it's going to be spent\nAnd like I said before there there are actually very few felony for and fives that are actually in the penitentiary on drug charges it's not going to free up\nThat much space but when you when you're stripping the ability for any jail time at all or any penitentiary at all and you don't have that hanging over and individuals had many you know a lot of people say you know you hear this what they have to you know people that are addicted they have to hit rock bottom first but they also need incentives to\nAnd it just it it it's no matter how you get there you have to get treatment you know I was one of those old school once when I first started why you coddling these people are you doing these drug courts where are you doing all of that but then when you start realizing that these people\nActually need help instead of the vicious circle that we're doing here you you gotta you gotta stride to uh you get these people better and it's the same time it reduces crime I mean how would you feel if you knew somebody down at the end of your street was busted a couple of times for heroin\nAnd then didn't didn't get any jail time for it and then in couldn't be forced to get\nYou know to get treatment and then you come home and in your house has completely been you know sure fertilized in in in ... you know ... what do you say to those people\nShare of jury agreed with us here and let me ask you this Bush you know when someone is um overdosed and they go to the hospital and they obviously were possessing heroin or they routinely charged with possession of heroin\nOnce the drugs are gone and in their system no but if they have their drugs on a yes but we also have the uh the cure the team that we came up with that when we find these individuals that have been overdosed\nWe send somebody from a drug and alcohol treatment with the deputy to um to try and get them into a rehab rate there to get them help and it's been it's been fairly successful not going to say it's a home\nRun but I don't accept cases but can you hang on a second I don't want to run into a break you have to a jury or your what's your schedule look like\nNo I'm I'm okay on our\nPart very good All right I don't really like to have guessed step to sit around and and wait for things but uh in this case we do I think it's important that album and I don't think I fully talked it out here yet a sheriff Jerry green more in a minute

this passes\nYou got it and then you have people out there is saying that if you possessed this ... which is pretty easy I I've never seen it myself but I imagine it's a very small amount of it that can be broken down and it's even deadly to come to touch with right it ...\nIt when you when you're talking milligrams you were talking a teeny tiny amount that is absolutely deadly\nWell All right

is just odd isn't it that we will find out that people are leasing heroin with ... and people are going out and getting it because they're getting a a quicker longer high\nThat's the kind of problems that we're having and that's the kind of problems that you need to address where you take a while to make the sausage you don't have somebody come in here and put it on from out of town and basically say okay let's vote on it and we're going to change your constitution\nA lot of it would you agree with me it's a lot of it is in response\nTo our legislators who have not addressed this\nI Wonder how soon we're going to have somebody that actually comes into the state and says you know what we're going to have a constitutional amendment this going to change the way you fund schools are we tried that did we we voted on that that's still not done\nProblem with this is when you get this kind of legislation you then have to go back and enforce it do you remember do you remember it wasn't too long ago that we were voting on reducing the cost of prescription drugs\nAnd they were going to be tied to the lowest price that we sell drugs\nTo state workers what people forgot about\nWas then you have to have an entire army of people that go back there in interpret this law and make it work\nWe make things so complicated and um I I you know what that's where you need to be informed you need to really know what this is all about\nAnd again I I go back and I say you know what was just not change things for the sake of changing things and that's what this is all about but there may be other opinions we'll start with Gary we don't get him on first year in areas are phones are seven to nine nine nine seven seven and\nYou know I I Would love to hear if anybody out there that maybe as a proponent of issue one\nAnd I don't I don't think is really alone\nDemocrat Republican lines I think this is a common sense thing and I guess the thing that really resonates with most people that you can possess a lot of ... when I say a lot you're talking about millimeters of her ... milligrams of ... and you can you can really seriously hurt people and\nYou'd be allowed to do that here's Gary first of all in the very first of all what what sign are you on on this issue\nI of course [laughter] no I was going to be perfect but I I'm actually a proponent of it all so here's one of the issues I have with the current way we deal with drug addiction just research is on line in the state of Ohio you're caught with\nCocaine which Jerry ... said is a felony the penalties for less than five grams a ... degree felony is up is a fine of up to twenty five hundred dollars at least six and up to twelve months of jail and if you have five grams\nOr more or less than ten grams it's up to five thousand and up to Eighteen months of jail time\nAll right so he said he wants to help people but you don't help people by putting them in a cage if they're only fall is possessing a drug upstate teams illegal now to his credit he said they kind of I have understood that jail time or incarceration doesn't really is it isn't very effective\nSomebody else has written this law and now we're going to have to deal with it we we you and I and Gary we all know that we need to stop putting people that are hopelessly addicted to drugs in jail\nA military that that's not the way to do it in you know we need to stop these people from stealing a in breaking into various places\nSo there are things that need to be done um maybe this is the way you hold the legislators feet to the fire or to go out and do so because they they have been lax in fixing does have a ...\nI I I agree and I and ... and ... ... people set down\nAnd look at the issue from the sheriff's to the judges to the\nThe medical community and everybody figure out a better system that can be done and perhaps this will spur them to do it but these constitutional amendments usually you know there have a sweetheart deals for the people that are that they want them and and and by changing the constitution you we don't do ourselves any favorite saying\nThat All right here's another thing that I think too is that Richard Cordray is a very bright guy he ... he worked in the same just record as judge Gore sick and you know in judge capital and you know he is a well educated guy I almost think that he got caught up\nIn supporting this that I think it may really hurt his campaign because he appears to be somewhat over there that's willing to go with this constitutional amendment\nI don't care what the polls said this seems out of step with most of my audience\nOr tell you what I live in war okay I've only seen ONE Campaign fine in favor of steak issue one in a lawn anywhere\nMhm and it's a house in my neighborhood that has been raided by the the Warren police and then narcotics agencies and whatnot four times and the last ten years so you go figure it out from there yeah I Know that it it just uh it makes no sense whatsoever\nAt all well thanks thanks for the conversation okay thank you um well listen to what Mike DeWine says about it\nIn a moment standby [noise] just [noise]\n[noise]\nWas over in St when

K. E. B.\nAnd what I'm Talking about the issue was that the last time we'll talk about again we'll talk about more but\nHere is what the current attorney general says about your shoe one so listen to this is talk about\nThe devastating consequences of a proposed constitutional amendment the on the ballot in November\nThis is known as the number one\nIt would make ... drug epidemic worse [noise] got the progress we've made and destroy lives and destroyed sandwich\nFishing one can simply dangerous breasts and shows or lack of understanding of what is now going on in the state of Ohio one ...\nAre treated and takes vital to walk\nAway from jak tools that are used by you used to get people industry tools that are currently being used for effectively to healthy and save lives [noise]\nOne will take Ohio backwards backward in our fight against the opioid epidemic by not charging people accused deadly crimes selling recently told me I\nRehab brutal painful all\nWants his belief in the physical tormented as far as getting over it takes the threat of something equally team says jail or prison time maniacs dream and\n[noise] this threat\nCarefully used by our judges have saved thousands and thousands of lives one will take that away [noise]\nThousands were made in the grips of opioids by not getting the treatment they need to recover because the truth is some people just don't go into treatment of Russian air push to do it [noise]\nThere's nothing humane about she was [noise] by\nAdding it into our state constitution to amendment we'll be hard pressed to easily changed these unworkable provisions pinpoint in the future [noise]\nProposed constitutional amendment ... Ohio would end up with some of the most lenient drug crime law of the nation [noise]\nMake you know highly safe haven for drug dealers and given the Mexican drug cartels or road map straight in to our neighborhoods [noise] let me simply say that\nAlong the Ohio River [noise]\nFrame Anderson's here from Orange County Ohio will be the flash or drug dealers will cross the river across the board to come here because it will in fact be a safe haven [noise]\nAnd this man will be particularly hard on a part of our state the borders and other states [noise] we will be the place to go for these drugs [noise]\nIn the race for governor strongly supports the passage of racial one [noise] and then one of the ... first public a vast year at Ohio and July was for me us attorney general Eric Holder [noise]\nUsed nonbinding resolutions they have executive orders they have police department policies are the limit the assistance with federal government\nAnd the sanctuary cities that we have or jurisdictions that we have right now\nColumbus ohio Richard Cordray lives and he'll you're so close by Dayton sanctuary place Lake County\nLima Lorraine Lucas county addiction Toledo overland south of Cleveland ah auditor buying a pain spill Ohio\nAll sanctuary designations how students at Oberlin College which is located in a sanctuary city began circulating a petition asking um their president to investigate how to make overland a sanctuary\nCampus you know the position was signed by more than twenty four hundred students so\nWhen you talk to a Richard Cordray who was running for the governor of Ohio he's right there is no such thing as a definition of a sanctuary city but we do they exist and they don't cooperate and the most egregious example is Libby chef from Oakland you know who she is right\nShe's the one that is so liberal\nBut when she found out there was going to be an ice rage you went out and inform the people that I was coming\nThat's pretty crazy as that is pretty crazy [noise] All right did as a one chapter hide friday and I'm lucky that we got to we're going to call her on voting Steve did your ear and early voter huh\nYou know ... real quick to a quarter say what's worse of the first amendment ... their customers wherever you know when you're on a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean\nYou don't try to fix the problem I make an old there right\nSo um yeah we voted me and my fiance voter today um for the first time ever in my entire life I voted strict party line including judges including including judges\nSecretary of state um governor ... everything I voted party of on it and I even looked at all the judges are looked him up to see what party affiliations because I've been so disgusted with the treatment that conservatives have had from the Democratic party on a federal level\nThat I figure we need to as society really strike out and show them we're not going to stand for this mhm so I voted and it's it's bad bad\nFor them to tell people how you're voting but I've flat out voted party line for the first time ever even though I'm completely against it morally\nWell here here's here's the thing that I'm thinking about is that\nI'm not quite there yet but I'm close to where you are because uh I I've kinda modified mind to a friends that I think are doing the job\nThere will be people that I Will vote for that I think that they're doing a good job and they may be only a Democrat in name but you go on the other way you're going to the entire way and you're saying you're just going right down if you do that doesn't that really shut you out from making a solid decision intellectually\nI'm On a on a hey we can agree on that one on a hand on some of the ... the the smaller position because I first and foremost on a on a national scale and even on a lot of the state\nA lot of water position I very well informed anyways and some of the stuff that people say it on the Democratic side are just absolutely so far you know for a full support of the\nIf you're going to support the cost of amendment\nYou know allowing people with twenty milligrams of setting all which can kill up to ten thousand people if you think that's a good thing it will be missed and then you're out your mind and if you're going to support something as completely off bases that then I Can't trust your judgment as a person in general I'm\nOn the local levels I I don't think there's a lot of people do locally I think a lot of the lord job people just kind of have um to to get recognition and attempts to get higher office\nWas kind of thinking that about the state legislature to Z because your Cordray is right in this in this instance that uh\nWe should have people that are doing something to reduce the amount of people in our jails we already know that that you got people in jail um they're becoming better criminals that should be done by the state legislators too bad that we have to have people from out of state and come in and do this and you kinda wonder why they are doing it\nThey're not doing it out but goodness they're hard they're doing it I think\nBecause they want to prove a point toward total\nOf decriminalization of drugs\nOh I also think too and I think this is a a lot of people are guilty on both the Democratic party side local state federal level they don't want to solve problems I truly don't believe they want you on on certain issues they want to create keep at least a little bit of a problem because if you\nIf you're completely solve a problem then you're putting themselves then you're putting them in their buddy you got a job you know all these if there isn't a product problem doesn't exist with all these with all these\nDrugs that all these organization government subsidies that you know people shut fans behind closed doors to to create they will go away so\nYeah I I don't know that you know here's my thought on you know people good getting\nI'm less you know less work in the prisons and stuff like that\nI think the prisons are having a hard time attracting people to even be prison guards right now I Know they are on the local level so I don't know if that flies I mean maybe Corrections Corporation of America they can take a hit if there were less criminals because the Republican because they're a private entity\nBut essentially um I don't really think that people want to work in prisons and they're gonna have a hard time creating these are ... getting people to work for him but ...\nAlso too you know I Want people need to realize that\nYou know prison is it being a ... working in the prisons as dangerous job but you know just solved the most is probably have whether it's drugs or poverty or\nAny any branch off those are all the biggest solution for all this is to fix the single parent her problem irresponsible reproduction of people having children they can't take care of because it only\nSpur there's the spread of that type of ideology and and that's just on a statistical basics basis as one hundred percent factual but nobody wants to address\nThat so there were back to my point here we need to pay people not to have kids\nOr or like I don't like I said before that require a license for people to have a child and if you have a child without having a license then you're not allowed to get any sort of\nPort on the truck because first African makes it a factor and it's a modified to do what it's supposed to do\nAll right if someone someone would like the same driveway I have ... give me the details\nOr you could just give us a call

I don't know if that's what they shouldn't have time\nNo yeah you're right I mean it's kind of just starting out here now but I think one of the things that they're trying to do it as saving money by not having the school buildings open that much because you you can turn the heat down probably on the weekends on friday\nI think that that had the attack your school is learning circuit right next to be what is happening to the grid what is happening to their their life situation and in fact there have been studies that have shown that\nIf you have the high school got may not have enough in the

... degree anywhere in the nation now on line to Michael Michael your thought on this\nMorning how are you good Michael are very well very\nConfusing topic I Can't figure out where it's coming from can you answer me what the whole point of it is to begin with\nWell I think it's school districts that were broke to tell you the truth for example Colorado they shifted ... schedule\nFor um well first of all for about a thousand students and what they were they had a five point five million dollar budget they say two hundred and six thousand dollars that's not a lot but that's just one of the examples they they're doing this basically to save money\nOkay well that's fine I and here's what I don't understand I listen to a report on the news the other night I'm from Youngstown, Ohio it was about to a library in pharaoh PA that has gone on from a ... opens a six days to five days and now talking about only being over three days\nAnd they say that they don't have the money to operate gr library now the school doesn't have enough money to operate the school I have a two thousand square foot home and more mental Ohio it's not in a rich neighborhood it's an average medium neighborhood where the average house is probably you're\nClose to a couple of hundred thousand dollars a day four thousand dollars a year for property tax\nOut look to me that's a lot of money you know being on disability for the last two years I found out that every bill matters in every like look at it on appeal matters and I don't understand how we've gone to my school I'm forty nine years old\nMy school days when everything was open every library was opened every public works was open and now all of a sudden\nPeople are making more money in their jobs people are getting more tax and yet we have no money for anything to operate the way it used to operate and I just can't understand why we have to make modifications for money purposes and is that really the purpose\nI is it an excuse me yeah I understand there's broke districts I understand my wife's a school teacher I understand I don't want those kids out of school one more day and they have to\nSay I'm going to bring up a ... that's an interesting topic why is there not enough money to go around for almost everything including roads schools bussing a libraries it was\nMore taxes less money to go around I'm going to take you up on it but I'm Out of time back in the U.S [noise] five Seventy nobody can be as\nThe sun goes I don't you think that there seems to be a growing segment in our society the backs socialism instead of

for days on for days off I've never tried that but it sounds intriguing doesn't it\nAnd the school years doesn't it sound intriguing why do we have to go five days a week why do most of us have to work five days a week could we get it done in four days wouldn't we be better off\nIf in fact we had more time to unwind wouldn't leisure time and uh all of the folks that have bowling alleys and golf

I got that but why is it that we continually\nDon't have enough money for police not enough money for firemen\nSecurity is always lacking and you know you just can't get enough of it nobody to pick up the trash well\nI shouldn't say nobody but I mean you talk about the city's over here in San Francisco and stuff like that more people not doing the right thing shouldn't we be prosperous I don't know it's sort of cranberries CBC ideas on this what's your ideas Jake\nWhen you were talking about a four day school week I was talking about I was thinking about all the studies that they view of the summer brain drain and lack talked a summer break short or because kids lose so much\nOver the summer so when that may be leaking into giving them three days off and not a you know hard at work if the studies\nSo you're saying that they wouldn't use that extra day for studies they would still wait till Sunday night\n[laughter] I I absolutely I mean we'd have to do another study on it and I can usually agree with the da dum lead having five children myself I don't believe in that same wire\nOr no they did studies where the kitchen better if they go to school at ten thirty in the mornings you ... you know be there at seven thirty\nWell is it is it true then get the kids all the kids the kids always ask for construction paper at nine o'clock on Sunday night\nAbsolutely hopefully hopefully the store still [laughter] you know [laughter] oh yeah you got out of here I'm chopping my hide out just to just that thought about the four day school week I don't know [noise] you know I don't know that was after\nWork out for the kids learning about um the thing I often here is ah the\nThe protest they made that saves that go on it happens on all sides I hear the purses sex well it happens on both sides and I go I don't remember the Democrats senator a veto in his yard by left his free from how the lip happens to live next door [laughter] I don't remember\nThe Democrats senator is like Ted Cruz being chased out of the restaurant I don't remember the uh uh on the\nDemocratic progressive side uh such as a Kansas oh in stating chased out of a restaurant up black female holy crap if she says anything you know we have to take that is ... right because she's she's an African American female she's a female of color we won't listen to whatever she says\nNow you will now you have people like Don Lemon and others are going to be in the position of having to criticize Kanye West for going to Donald Trump\nOr you know we we we have other people out here but or falling into this category of oh well we we got to criticize them because they're with Donald Trump because Donald Trump is the orange clown as they call him\nAbsolutely and the words and language their views of words Kanye West ... it just it seems I'm ... and they do all day and it just breaks down to you know what\nI agree with much more with the person who a person of color who is conservative or has the same ideas it's me I don't care what color they are it seems that the left cares what color people are and what a sec state might be\nNow you've got you've got more black conservatives now and people are going to push criticizing they're going to say\nThat Tonya West is a guy that doesn't read and that he is not scholarly are going to say the same thing about diamond in silk\nBut here's my thought about the broader part about this\nThis is getting people of color to look at the entire picture and they're saying yes there are other people out there that do believe that we are not moving ahead and that we did not move ahead under President Obama and we can take a look at the just because we had a black president doesn't necessarily mean my life got better\nNow and and I grew up reading listening to people like a while for Williams like Thomas sold a Alan Keyes you know uh I just met a this past year the a sheriff David Clarke a\nVillage from your heart for you and he's a he's like a very strong
