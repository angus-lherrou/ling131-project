K. being our pre games at five and the kickoff his at six\nAnd we take on South Dakota so we're talking about data and or the new data comes in and we're hoping maybe the trumps the trade war but I just wanted to see my I'm correct your I was telling the audience at a day when we do go in and we terror things that tariff goes to the U.S treasury\nAnd the ... and I'm thinking I Am I correct or write to U.S Treasury takes that money that's correct\nThen could they take that money and use that to help people out here that may be hurt but the ...\n[noise] yes but let's talk more data and this is Federal Reserve data that I have ... and I came in through the wall Street Journal but right now there's seven point one million jobs that are unfilled in the United states right now right so the economic impact\n... the reason that significant when you have and here's another statistic that's even more important the number of\nUnfilled positions now exceeds the number of unemployed people [noise]\nSo what that means to to to the rest of the road is that typically means wage inflation okay so you're going to start paying people more to keep them are paying more people to hire them so as you continue to have wage inflation that health theoretically should help offset some of the increasing costs due to the terrorists\nGreat is so basically you're saying that when we see Amazon is I maybe I'm right on this again I said you know what Amazon wasn't made to do this by the federal government by some artificial minimum wage they did this to retain their employees didn't they\nMatch my belief goes coming into the season they're going to need a lot of workers and and and there's such a such a large machine that if they don't have a number of people that they need they can execute on what they promised\nSo they got to get ahead they and they did it early so they can get ahead of the other retailers that are doing seasonal hiring so that they're the first one in like people are looking for\nSomething else I'd picked up two when you see seven point one million jobs unfilled you think well maybe this just happened during the Trump Administration that's not necessarily true because we have been as high as six million jobs unfilled in the last ten years we have to correct but you're saying that job is significant if we're going to seven ... seven point one now\nWhat's significant about that shared that significant but which to me the number that's more significant as the number of jobs that are available exceed the number of people that are unemployed and being in the old days of economics we considered four percent unemployment full employment\nBecause there's always some you're always and play some people are always in play in between jobs looking for jobs quitting their job they didn't like so you never get to a hundred percent unemployment just not a practical economic theory\nDitch your theory that I'm being financially secure doesn't have to be a crap shoot that if you sit down and plan and you have X number of dollars or if you have money coming in you can figure out something based on your age and desire\nTo take the the fear out of it as much as possible I mean not get a ticket totally out but you're going to arm your customers with knowledge that pretty much your theory\nYeah in in in the sort of encapsulate that being what we do is is we spend a lot of time with what I call risk management you know in in risk management people normally associate with insurance but I I employ that a lot when it comes to managing your money because if we can manage the risk than we can have a better control of getting the outcomes we desire\nGot it got it and that doesn't make sense that of course the if in fact you decided to go with Leo then you've got you have to have some trust there too because a lot of people as soon as things go south the paleo what the hell you didn't tell me about this\nYeah it's you know we call it when we have a we call ... vulnerable conversation stand and we have those up front to make sure that we're on the same page and and then that we believe we're going in the same direction because I found that for not being it's typically broken inch as a matter of time to recall long ago\nWell listen I'm going to move on to give your information real quick and then we're going to move on to our next topic\nYou can call me three three o five three three six nine three six or email me Leo at Jim Young dot com\n[noise] I'll read legal good to see ya go penguins at all that's going to be great a Saturday Night you got to take it easy and my next topic is going to be a bit of a warning on\nWhat I think the issue one means to you and me and the state of Ohio that's coming up at night oh says [noise]\nESPN college football\nJohn line that band brothers dot com these news radio five Seventy\nSomeone you Katie and\nSherrie Westin question is continuing in Turkey after the disappearance\nIf in fact you vote for this this will forever change the Ohio constitution\nAnd it will say that if you were caught with the prescribe them other drugs and a twenty four month period you don't go to jail\nThat will be changed in the Ohio constitution and many times we come back and we tweak these laws because you don't really get hey are they just we tweak life we really do\nHow many times that of how many times do we have when you're writing policy and if you're a manager you do a lot of that and you think you know and you sit in your office and you write this down and then you put it into practical use and you go into that didn't work\nThat didn't work and the thing about it is that you got to tweak it well with the state constitution you may not be able to tweak this at all\nAnd this may be unconstitutional also\nFolks I I just think it's something that we don't need that a case right I'm ... phones are coming in right now and I want to take your calls here on this\nOr we're going to talk to someone that is familiar with FEMA also that's coming about nine thirty six he works for the hill has come and go nine thirty well let's talk this outright bell\nI'm giving your thoughts on this a couple of points\nDo I have it right verse as far as you can tell and second of all\nWhat about a constitutional change you wouldn't want would you want that and I'll give you this I have been more\nThan liberal and understanding on drug laws\nIs my fervent believe that we're never going to incarcerate our way out of this we're never going to be able to interdict the drugs that are coming in here the only method to really stop is to change the heart of mankind\nAnd that means you have to get past this desire to be in ...\nAnd that's what we have we have a desire\nFor people out there to ... well not not us but we there are people out there that have a\nA desire to be in an unreal world than mostly that's by drugs and alcohol and until we turn away from that I don't think there's much hope so we do need some changes but this one just isn't the\nOne call right now I think we still have a couple of lines of elbow seven to nine nine nine seven seven and we'll forward you the right of calling in anonymously today and you can also bring any topic you want but I Want to talk about this one first hard line one Hi good morning and welcome to the show you're on five Seventy W. K. being\nGood morning\nGood morning thoughts\nA road trip to draw one question one ride I got two questions or is it possible because I Know a lot of the times in my voting history in Ohio when you see those are those issues there are a lot of the voting public\nMissile understands what a no vote means what are your name is that a possibility here Mm\n... yeah not not so much on this one a yes vote means that you would be voting for the issue which would keep people from going to prison and in my opinion keep them from going to drug court so I think just just a no vote you're rejecting this\nBut okay well if you I mean that's that's the simplicity of most of them but sometimes people just misunderstand ... yes I don't want this or no I Do want this and I didn't go out you know rather\nThan go on this one on on this one in my opinion you just wanna rejected and I've been I've been more than open minded on this stuff but I did it doesn't make any sense to you that we would do this\nNo it doesn't um\nYou know that's where we have enough um situations where um you know those who break the law and kind of laugh in the face for those that are older and uh we're just giving up my mother actually three more opportunities um\nBe the other question I had is uh I'm not I'm I'm not planning on going out and not taking advantage of this but uh these these are\nBasically three strikes are they like traffic violations I've had for traffic violations when they reach a or you know as a certain date and the counter they come off and you know you you get a you know those points come off your record is is going to be a role in kind of thing that okay I've got a\nYou know to a fast food but one was uh Eighteen months ago so uh it's going to ... it's going to clear I'm back on you know strike one\nThat's a bird understand what I'm doing what I mean I Know I ... yeah basically what you're saying is that a a say on this date you commit this offense and uh you don't do one for a year and then for another year or you know back to um yeah yeah yeah um yeah I don't know that that's a that's another very good question to ask\nYou know but I'll Try to get that from somebody that does no I'll be honest with you I don't know the answer to that I Would assume that what they're saying is if I committed own offense on this October Seventeen and I do three a within twenty four months then I could go to jail\nBut um do we ... when does the clock start running from your first offense and when does that come off\nRight I'm right outside of that sort of a very odd but I think that's a good I\nMean it's a good idea but if they're doing that boy that just real after I just give limited um ...\nYeah okay that's a that was my thought is Warren thank you\nThank you you asked me a good question because er and maybe somebody out there knows the answer to that but I I go back to this here here's something that um\nI I don't know\nHow this could possibly be winning and apparently the polling data says that in his wedding that surprises me in itself I mean to me number one you lose because it's a constitutional amendment how often do you want a constitutional amendment ... not often do you\nKnow you don't want to be messing with the constitution every time there's some little quirk in the law you want to change\nYou know I I Would think not I would think not our topic is issue one I'm\nJust one one question if you're going to ask the question of ... it'd be great let's go to our next call how good morning and welcome you're on the air on by Seventy nobody who can be an\nEye on it it's one thing if somebody wants to voluntarily go to a drug court\nUm to to to try to help themselves get better or something um I Would imagine possibly at the same scenario I even if issue on passes\nThe the the the crux of the issue is is if let's say for instance somebody for the first time they got caught you know maybe with cocaine and it was that five grams or less\nUm right now I that's a felony and we went over this last week you know at the twenty five hundred dollar fine and you have to get to six to twelve months in jail um and and that that face on my research I believe that the case so that's the first to fat\nHow's that going to help somebody who doesn't want to help first of all and secondly why shouldn't ... by itself as a tax payer have to pay up to thirty thousand dollars a year to keep them in a cage if they're non violent so that's I think that's one of the biggest issues that issue one gets correct\nThat I shouldn't have to pay that tax payer to put somebody in a cage because then there's the net effect they come out of the system that probably better well connected they haven't been ... rehabilitated they also have this on there I I tried this on your permanent record that's going to prevent them from a climate now they have you know little incentive to try to get back out there\nGet a job let me turn it around because you you just hit me with that one and I'm going to go back and say okay if in fact I have an offense that could send me to jail that they could send me to jail now I'm going to bargain not to go to jail by going to drug court\nNow um if this passes I won't have to go to a drug court and I'll still remain out of jail so am I really going to get any help\nI first of all you have if you're an addict you have to if you have to want to help first\nUm second of all as a matter of just a principal if only fault is doing a drug that the state does not approve of\nThan what crime has they're really being committed outside the realms of you know just laws and written on paper what were were thick them whereas the victimization when we don't want to stop police now say that oh you might do this and you might not do that we have to deal in reality and what actually happened\nThere's no victim and I'm Talking about a third party that down you can be as they can live on your own actions by law enforcement should it be you know I have a place in and you try and force that but if there's no third party that can as a result of your action while the white or how do I have to pay as a taxpayer to quit somebody in prison and why should that person to be in prison and the first place [noise]\nMhm yeah yeah you're you're making um you're you're making a a a pretty good argument for why you should stay out of jail because something that you don't really think is that\nThat affected by the ... you would agree with me if I can argue on that basis can I at least convince you that we shouldn't do this through a constitutional amendment I Would actually sit down with you and we would reach some kind of agreement\nKind it to the end that you say you want without doing a constitutional amendment\nMe they're they're quick and easy and charge it at ... thank you gift it's often\nYou are a woman for all seasons I'll tell you All right CKC cleaning thank you to bank

Colorado was the black market has actually been flooded with people because of the easy accessibility for legalized ... legal\nMarijuana so it's really hard to distinguish what legal and what's not just because of ah because of all the regulations make the drug more expensive so there's there's a ton of victims\nUm with regards to legalize use and and not only that but culturally you're you're leading a signing down a path of destruction and we've and that's been proven time and time again so\n[noise] but I Do want to point out something you know with regards to cause I remember ... I can well last week he shares a study on like sixty percent of people support the use of marijuana I think it was a form of lying if I'm not mistaken legalize\nMarijuana right ready before came to Canada legalized that um there was a study out there that it's in the sixties now people believe that marijuana is okay\nWell I like three to think about a look at the map and look at the population vote\nOr the presidential election I'm Out of out of the voting populace Hillary got little fifty per se\nAnd yet it was only she she literally the whole that whole United States ... and her ... will I have a feeling that that even though it takes that you said I I Would be curious to see the ... ... Haitians on that because I Would I Would imagine that a vast majority of those is on its legalized marijuana from in New York\nAnd California and obviously have a section locally by\nYou know if you look at the map as a whole it's ... I don't think it's as widespread as people think I think you just have very natural areas of\nA little bit off ... ... what I'm really concerned about thank you for your call what I'm concerned about is whether issue one passes in the state of Ohio either I happen to think is bad law and your your changed the constitution\nBut that will get right back to that and um the thing that I still do but saying I think this would be the end of drug courts if in fact you're going to go and have drug courts which most people say are fairly successful\nThere would be no compunction for you to attend\nDrug court because there would be that carrot and stick out there where you're saying okay\nIn order for you to stay out of jail you go to drug courts I think we lose that with this issue one that's the big issue\nUm we had an opportunity to talk to some folks from the hill the other day and they certainly are an up and coming your way to get news and we have on our news maker line this morning new pillows and um he represents the hill and he's been studying somebody's got to be interesting to me and that is\nWhat we do to fund FEMA and the new welcome it's good to meet you how are you\nThanks for having me it's great to be here\nYeah so this is the first thing I Would ask how is um FEMA funded and we always have money to go to disasters um is this a budgetary item what how does this work\nSo every year they might get a certain amount of funding and the department of homeland security appropriations bill\nUm and a small part of that is set aside for the actual running of the agency the administrative costs\nBut much much bigger bucket goes to what's called the disaster relief on a couple of billion dollars the one in the uh twenty Nineteen I'm a bill\nIs around seven billion so that's the amount that Congress sets aside to go for him as disaster relief every year the thing is that does not nearly account for the amount that you know how to spend on disastrous every year the kinds of disasters are getting bigger more frequent more expensive\nAnd um they just don't have enough money\nSo Congress has to go back and find other ways to pay for it and the way that the system works right now is that there is a certain amount of aside every year what Congress said okay we have a cap of how much we're supposed to spend every year but\nThis is an amount that we expect we might have to allocate for disaster relief and that's not going to count towards the cap so basically every year they carve out an amount that doesn't count toward the overall ending\nWhich can be used for disaster relief and that's a good thing on one hand because that means there's not a lot of political argument when you need to get those funds out which is the first priority in a disaster\nBut the downside is that there's never a question of how are we going to pay for this this is money that is basically just deficit financed it goes right into the deficit and it doesn't count towards any of the cap\nThat Congress that to try to sort of keep spending at a certain level\nIt makes no sense [laughter] but um you guys are mostly uh on line but when I was in Washington a few weeks ago doing my show you guys have a printed version of the hill too is that right\nYeah we did we have a president version of our newspaper that it it's a free newspaper that we get around the city and um the biggest audience for that I think is the politicos here in\nUh Washington so it's it's kind of neat that when you're walking around the Capitol you'll see the New York times to see the Washington Post and then you'll see a couple of similar publications to the hill that focus on policy so um so the lawmakers\nHave a look at the publication not when they're here\nBriefly what's your next assigned but what what are you going to focus on your next door\nOr you know the mid term that are right around the corner and that is the big story right now in Washington what's going to happen and what comes next people are expecting there could be a a blue wave in the house projector production say that is a good chance Democrats will take the house\nAnd a very good chance that Republicans will keep Senate so we're looking forward to um a divided government um in in just a couple of weeks and the question is what happens and\nWhat do you think the chances of a blue wave happening in the house or\nIf you look at the polls out there um they're very high um you know I think five thirty eight put that around eighty\nChance that it's going to be a Democratic majority in the house um and obviously that's going to change the dynamics of Washington having headed by the government having a house that has no power on that's certainly what it comes to ending um you know it it\nIt's a time where Democrats are going to try to boost their priorities and\nUm there are also questions about whether or not this is a good chance or a realignment with Trump Administration that maybe maybe Trump will take the opportunity to say you know what if the Democrats are and how maybe now to talk about infrastructure that\nThat thing that he talked so much about in the campaign show that could have been a good bipartisan\nI'm a initiatives that are like ... you know they'll be in charge that could\nBe for structure like a like a like a big wall you know there there's good infrastructure already knew I get a run appreciate it thank you for coming on we'll call you again\nAll right thanks so much thank you let's take a break and then we'll get back to

to kill a hundred people there and I mean that's not exactly a nine substance here and we're certainly not in that quantity so it's\n... we we have to think long and hard about changing the state constitution\nTo decriminalize something that is really dangerous yeah\nI mean you do you think about the offend all folks I Know that all that much about the use of drugs or anything like that I don't use them but um if you think about heroin and the people that are using this and some of this ... is being black market at the end of the United states by your normal overnight express China and they're they're studying it in\nAnd people are leasing this with I'm putting in their heroin and then some people were actually desirous of getting that and now we've gone to this\nSilly point of going down and saying well we're going to give you a little stick that you could test to see for spending all in your cat oh we're also going to make available for you know ... and bringing your back with the law was struck me how far are we going to go with this entire problem\nEthics incredibly ... stress that's happening in\nWhite whole higher in the fire department down there and white hall

bit of heroin so maybe you'll go I'm a you know you you don't kill yourself and they say well intentioned right that we're going to try to save lives but what have you done here basically you've encourage people to continue to use this\nYou're enabling them you know that's not a good thing and\nYou made a great point here if you take ... and you just need a small amount of is to put it into other drugs or you could actually ply your trade here even if you're caught with a small amount of ... you're not necessarily going to go to jail and I can't think of anybody that thinks that people are that are applying the trade of federal shouldn't go to jail because you're killing people\nI mean there is that you are men is this is a deadly substance it's not like you know you're selling some buddy you know a little bag of wheat or something like that this is stuff that is killing people\nYou know if I were taking your calls on this and it'd be kind of our ongoing theory a about this issue one the other thing I always say is that um you know when they cut polling data out here\nThat says that this thing is I'm ... and I actually folks you got to educate yourself and tell your other friends out there go read go read this like I've read this in and see what it does it just make any sense first blush of with you\nFirst blush up with a Richard Cordray and I'm going you know what I guess that makes sense to keep people out of jail but then you start to look at it and Mike DeWine brought up the point that you could possess a lot of ... and uh they couldn't really send you to jail so we got it\n[noise] I got to get this off but just you know we just had to the gym gentleman on there from the hill and he's talking about the potential of a blue wave and I know what he's talking about typically in the first term of the president when he comes up for election\nI'm about half the people that didn't vote and the other people or irritated at the prison they come back and they I'm going to make an example of him and they're going to vote the Congress blue or they're gonna voted read whatever happens it happens from time to time and I don't know what the answer is going to be\nBut that this is just one thing that I think that um you need to be outraged about because\nYou you may think that I'm taking a along step on this but look\nThe video that they just put out\nCorrelating till millennia Trump\nIs about as low as you can go now I mean here you have and and this is retribution\nBecause Kanye West a noted African American performer went to the White House got an audience with Donald Trump and said that he likes what Donald Trump is doing and that Donald Trump is making a difference in keeping young black men out of jail he's helping with\nThe unemployment rate and he's saying guys\nThere's got to be another way rather than going with the tried and true method of the Democrats who given given give\nAnd basically keep you down that way they keep you down by saying hey this is too good for you to pass up Kanye West speaking out against that people criticize me and they said well what you're criticizing Kanye West for\nA trying to take Taylor Swift trophy yeah he's an idiot he's an idiot going back and doing that but um you know one thing doesn't define all people I probably could find some common ground eventually with Dick Durban maybe on something you know what\nMaybe we would like uh maybe like a play bought you together I don't know\nBut I you know ... you don't define everybody but you go back and you you see this video\nCame to fruition on Monday morning that Sears filed for chapter ... bankruptcy or it's you know it's a sad thing for rental or an old venerable name in retailing to go that direction\nBut

no education or no help from my dog problem\nSo no I got more\nCouple of more things here but uh as your as your in the moaning county jail and you're are you arrested immediately and taken into um a custody and put them in jail that night when you had the packets with you\nOh of course yeah\nOkay got will how one did you do then if you were hooked on heroin or were you given treatment to get off the heroin or did you just have to suffer in the so\nI I guess suffered in the south and they uh they they have a nurse I'm by one today are quite sad sack high blood pressure and everything and not and that that was that you know how\n... how bad was that he can you describe what you were going through\nA cat and I can um\nI Can't even describe it it's the worst\nThe worst agony and misery if it's almost like drives you crazy after the third or at night and as late but at a ... something terrible that you wish now but it it goes through\nHow long did it take before you started feeling better\nI'd say about seven eight days later a I was able to start eating again and walking around in and out actually able to sleep and while it's a yeah\nDid they did they allow you to get out of the cell to take a shower during that period\nYeah\nOkay so you would go out supervised and go right back but you were sick as a dog would it would it\nBe anything on and on for seven days side and on our I didn't do not then by the way and I caught a like a\n... you can't you can't\nYeah I guess\nYou have your ... your your entire body heard I mean worse than the worst flu you've ever had\nYes yeah\nAnd that and that's what you did they give you anything to help you get through the pain\nNo they can they can get the Tylenol\nAnd uh that they that was a gift but when I first when I could get Tylenol in Miami for Tylenol the second time\nThey said we can't get to eat out for free them by not mock commissary\nNo and and now it's true you know and I eventually gained the commissary less than you know that's when you call your family or the white right Ken Kenny send me some money you know there's those things I Need to get aired right there is not a case de ... more aid and\nNow I Know you know I get all that but again we go back to your taking me through this now so in your mind when you're going through this are you glad that you're getting sober up in the jail\nOr yeah that's that's one thing that goes through them on a lot and um you know I hate it that it had the um at this and now but uh but I yeah that's the one good thing I'm Glad I get over it up about it I ate a they don't really\nGo after and treat yeah why you're as any innate street that and now a and eat on and they get it talk to other addict and how they eat it except late because right after they kicked you right back out of jail after he served your time right back and say this very\nAh you know that's one of the first things you think about it again and now you have a guy that yeah you were forced to stop doing that by you never that's at ... an hour and\nAnd now we're talking with one talking whether we're talking with one of our callers that called in to try to tell us what it's like to go through drug treatments\nAnd talk to eventually by the issue one we've got a five or six more minutes with him but I'm the one thing is he says he's another town guy came into young zone to buy his\nUm heroin and picked up some packets\nAnd he had an amount that the five or six pack has that was a felony and eventually went to court and then was sentenced to jail so you're getting sober in jail and now you're being moved to another prison and you're going to serve yourself news which was you're saying the sentence was one year is that correct\nYeah okay so you're in there for one year were you were you able to use drugs while you're in jail or were you completely sober during the winter time you were in jail\nNow that was another thing when I got to praise and I who do you have the option you are dropped in that you know but um\nBut when your family family sending in money and yet you want it every day that I that ally I needed other games like food and I get when you get during my time to get back out\nAnd chat while you while you were in prison [noise] um you you you you remain sober\nAnd ah you were able to get a to get beyond this could you if if it had been a lesser time in your opinion let's just say if you went to the bone in county jail and you got clean and then you went back to the streets do you think you would have gone back to using\n\nSo maybe in that regard jail was a good thing for you and um but you know what I mean I mean to to be able to cause potentially right mind I\nThink and then after a year you know being in there you get left out ... you can go right back to it to you know when you're when you're in jail that drugs he might not want to deal with them ... feet or gang that might have equal rights that that have that drive down there\nAnd you don't want to just you don't even want to get in all you want to get it and get out of there and Alan\nJohnson downhill but did you get any help in jail to help you overcome this now none none at
