going to do\nSo um me and Marianne who she hopes he's listening her and I created a appropriate committee and so we we did with this program committee I Would get all the products and we have the the girls cook all these ... and we ended up raising\nThousands and thousands of dollars so we were able to pay off all the debts of St Patrick's put a nice cushion in there and so we actually I mean I hate to say this but we actually ran the tricks like a business and we watched ... and then went to the diocese has said listen we could be self sufficient\nWas was just under bishop Murray or was this other bishops hoping it was under ... okay yeah he'll he listened to you folks because you ... you you couldn't pay the pay the freight the week before that I mean and then you got it and it's funny that I was just in St Paul's on a Sunday\nAnd a father at ... was the priest and he and someone was talking about uh\nUh we have parochial blessings because they do so well in the parochial and ah you know some people do bingo some people do parochial and he said it's a blessing to have the parochial that's our sister church\nSt Paul's and Salem father Bob that both of them and they're fabulous over those St Paul's and say I'm not talking about St Paul's new below not ...\nBut I'm In any case of you guys save that church for another day and you're still thriving so\n... ... they're ... hey uh since then she's one of my team really member she's incredible she's taken over the ... committee this year she's a good expand the varieties I think we're getting an apricot we might do some room\nI sell a parochial set to release\nBoth stores yeah home made from scratch yeah\nUm does that ever interfere with your business because there's so many businesses that no you know you have to compete with the churches and stuff like that do you think about it\nNo because everyone loves ...\n[laughter] so we had last night LA drug is you really can't live in Youngstown really\nYeah that's true so well what is the story of a really brothers you folks um built is what I call pretty much of a super store here on south avenue\nIn view of the fact that we're probably over grocery here you know giant eagle has a tremendous footprint here um and and then of course you go with\nSams and if you travel it's Cosco it's oldies hits all of the competition or how are you able to make that work as an independent\nBut it's an amazing question I mean the thing the thing is with us\nWe had these generations of people to shop in the stores so you have to really ... have them part of your family\nBut also with us we're destination store so um you know we ... here here's a couple of examples okay U.S team a team ... where you have to also you have these different items that a lot of people don't carry and the reason why they don't carry them as\nWhen you own a grocery store like a er Austin Town store has thirty four thousand items I think ... fifty two thousand items so if you have fifty two thousand items you are in a sense\nA landlord and so you got fifty two thousand clients that living you're building that have to pay rent so like giant eagle expects you to have three to four cases per month flipping sometimes five cases and if you don't they pull that and then they put another item that's going to sell better well\nYou know in the business model that makes all the sense in the world but for us we're a little bit different because we're a destination stores so I have like I mean when you look through my card catalogue check cashing cards we have about Ninety thousand people registered I have a hundred and Seventy two from Steubenville\nThree hundred and ... ville Chagrin Falls short in Westford\nAh you know list then you know a lot I mean here's something else as interested in my dad gave me these journals that we had back in the Nineteen thirties my grandpa used to deliver everyday we'd have a delivery truck one truck would go to say a\nNiles one truck would go to ... we'd have a truck that would go down to Stevens on we had a lead Tony a truck\nSo he gave me the tone you log in like ... all all my people from St Patrick's it was or grandparents or great grandparents buying from the store so like if you have a product like you know I mentioned ... or a ... a certain like super ... do\nYou keep carrying it because people know you're going to have that and that becomes part of their life especially at Christmas\nWell you know here's the thing about it Steubenville is not that easy to get to um you know we ... my sister lived on a ... and uh you know to travel to the Steubenville you get on the road seven and there was working on it but these people make a point of driving to really brothers they\nDo that is great it is a is there going to get there once a month and not coming twice a week and a lot of times when we noticed even more and boardman than in Austin Town or they make like they go to boardman and maybe they have an attorney may they went to go see the CPA maybe they want to go to the mall and ready to throw us on that that that route and you know\nSo this is a a profitable model for you here you have two stories in in this valley here and even though you're going to all this kinds of trouble to carry fell soap or you're talking about some of the smaller\nA moat lesser known item it works for you\nIt does it does you know in groceries when you Google percentage of grocery store or the net on a grocery profit is only about one quarter to one and a half that's why you have to do such a volume\nSo it it it's a tricky thing for me I'm In charge of perishable so my passion is produce mhm and I mean if you know produce and you look at the\nWell I mean I Know people are talking about produce a ruler they don't my wife is one of those that we had a really bad here this morning up there [laughter] but uh yeah so it really works for you know you're you're the operations manager I Am now director of operations so do you think that that prepared you for a a job in the Senate\nI Do I think I think um you know life's really incredible and you know you're either in observer\nParticipants I Want to be a ... and I think you know God gives me all these different is different challenges you know the ... that speech the speech was incredible and being around people that speak so much better than me and makes you better you know as a musician when you're with a musician that's better makes you better so with ... the\nSame thing because I listen to people who are much better that high up and you pick up things and you realize how they do it in fact I was at a meeting do day we're Greg Smith\nA from Costco he was talking about speech and he has become an order he is terrific crazy incredible and um yeah I used to in fact he was speaking of night and the vet and uh you just watch how he does it voice go slower and but it but that's what you want to do you

that ah there's things that need to be changed with guns ... would you be able to well\nI think the problem with the politics right now is there's no civil discourse you know all my friends are Democrats doing my best friends are Democrats when we talk constantly and that's one of the issues we talk about I think the conversation has to be fair\nI don't think it can be one sided I think people have that knowledge I don't think I just you and you're talking points does anyone any good but when you stop conversation you stop civil discourse that could be the nation of this country\nNo war and Gary for Michael\nI Believe Trump campaigned on one of the things to match ups or the possibility of being um tax credits for home schoolers my wife and I home school of course our property tax goes towards schools that my children don't use it quite expensive or dealing with curriculums materials which for such a measure\nThat you know it's a very fair question so right now every single student at Cincinnati seat is roughly about six thousand dollars\nAnd so there's so many different issues we talk about schooling in ... in Ohio as far as like open a Roman all these different things but as far as I'm home schooling that's you're American right to be home schooled so whatever the credit is being issued to the public schools that uh it should also be issued to the home schooled as long as you meet the standards of the state\nAnd I read Michael really a double duty and Emanuel if you hold on I'll take your calls at ten oh six and did give me more time because I'm going to run

so cold in the store in Austin [laughter] I I don't know ... you're right even the board and one is called you are but that's most mostly over by the produce I'm\nMore concerned with why it's so damn

gets done and becomes all about getting re elected I didn't answer it but\nI didn't ask them that but again I'm that is the trap out there but I I Would say that he has a better chance than normal because what\nYou're not taking any pac money in and he's basically raising money with friends and family\nIt's pretty good background to Emerson College anyway let's go to um our first caller and this is Emanuel hello Emanuel you're on\nThe amount of guys good morning well I agree my is a great guy because I'm a great family and they had a lot of good in the neighborhood\n\nI read this and it says you can't do anything in ... what's your business towards your campaign now I understand that it's his lawyers\nSay that it's okay\nBut that doesn't mean it's okay ... ... email ... found guilty but was he in class they pay the thousand dollar fine so that gives me two things that like ... and ...\nOn the teach my kids voucher you told me and I'm a teach my kids now the first thing I learned what I've heard Russ Limbaugh say if you want to find out what's going on follow the money\nAnd I heard you say something about a couple of years ago and politics about waiting and I think it was this what this is about weight loss it saves you can't do that a guy I don't get one of these lawyers say\nWell I Am he says that his lawyers have given him a the go ahead to continue to do this that the ruling is that it's within the law but I Would agree with you there's really not much happens during an election if in fact you're ... you're caught about a telling something about your opponent that isn't true\nThey don't come back and they don't sanction you for it in fact you can lie in commercials\nBut ah I ... in in in ... often it it does happen but here's a here's the thing about it I Would say about this you know if in fact the other ruling is that Michael really has nine stemming out of his uh out of it as a\nStore and it's illegal I don't know is is that really a reason not to elect him and you're basically we're going to go back on something that's small where you put up signs here and they don't think it's very important because the vines are only five hundred to a thousand dollars for breaking the election law\nWell I'm going to say to eat the bad guy but the majority of people it's human nature you start out with a small crime\nNow come on mom you are really if you look I rarely or are you going to\nGet my kids would have gone up all the object is the way what do you guys have a great day okay\nYeah but do they come on now G ...

to agree to you what do you want\nAn addition to that um it's just very frustrating to watch the way the Democratic party has handled this day at a hearing it was eighty two days and information ... ... a Senator Feinstein\nSaid they wanted to handle this correctly and not make a spectacle themselves and the country they would've brought it to the FBI and\nEverything and\nI've been saying that a long time that Dianne Feinstein looks very bad in this because she didn't bring it up she didn't have to go public with it but she could have given to the committee\nAnd I did a good amount could have been a quiet investigation it could have they should this woman could have been vetted and are not in the public spectacle that we have out here she don't want to the gentleman that called in before\nUm don't you think we have an exchange of ideas here I mean you know what I'm I'm not totally all I'm not going to go down the line and say that every policemen is perfect every Republican is perfect there's there there's there's grey areas everywhere\nAnd I just think that he basically was frustrated and that he didn't wanna have a conversation with me he all he wanted to say Kavanaugh would not take a lie detector tests\nAnd [noise] number one I Would go back with us no court is going to say that I Would lie detector test is the gold standard or they\nThey are not in addition to that I don't believe any judge out there and it's right mind would take the evidence or lack there of evidence that Dr Ford is presenting and move on with her case feeding\nI Believe they throw the case out for lack of evidence\nYeah I mean as you know we we do a lot of trial and error here but when you're going into court of law they want proof they\nWant they don't they don't want circumstantial evidence they want proof and we just we just didn't have it in that case\nUm I I don't know where are we going with this country right now are we that far apart because you just brought up on the left wing news media is CNN and MSNBC I I've seen clips where their show they're talking about this guy is just a serial sexual predator they don't do that\nNow it's all they're literally just feeding the left side what they want to hear to divide us more of the country there's nothing\nWhat if he's not what if he has been completely um mischaracterized here where does he go to get his

Can't believe we're that far apart from what are you know John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan's parties were uh but right now there's there seems to be no common ground\nThe only common ground if there's any hope I I reject your him an ... mafia analogy because I don't I don't I don't think it's down in ... you know where we're going to bump somebody off or something like that so\nI think the worst habit of somebody off yeah oh you know but but\nYou remember a couple of years ago it was a young gentleman going to give some information in Washington DC who decided to take a walk at four o'clock in the morning\nEnded up ... in that as long as the information against it and\nIf I can remember that I mean I think that was refuted because he was going to go back and he was going to tell tale against Hillary Clinton and people by that but I I don't think that that turned out to be the case of so many things so but thank you appreciate it but you know lose going back here and saying that uh you know it's cloak and dagger now the thing\nAbout it is that um I still think that there are plenty of Democrats out there that are red white and blue that they want just the same thing to do you want but so often so often is in the case of many things you go and you become a member of a party\nAnd its party over common sense that's the problem\nI Want independence I was impressed with Michael really this morning and you don't make a really came in here\nI I think a humble man who has done a lot of good and basically talked about the issues how he very how we differed on John Boccieri not that he hated John butcher and not that there's any Democrats that never were any good but\nWhen I see the Democrats out their spouting things like we need to have a national paycheck\nRight you you've seen this thing where people say okay we need we didn't have a universal pay everybody gets paid folks I'm not a scholar but I Know that that does not work just simply based on raising children\nKids will give you know they'll they'll take whatever they can give and they'll do less and less the only thing that you can do to motivate\nIs trust and verify just like Ronald Reagan used to say come back and do you want that bicycle here's what you have to do crazy crazy\n[noise] All right let's go to Susan on five Seventy WKBD hello Susan good morning and welcome\nGood morning thank you for highly calling on me appreciate falling or did you have your hand raised\nTeacher teacher called me [laughter] guy right I'm shaking it and wait a minute ago hurricane wait a minute what [laughter] handle or I\nJust wanted to call and say I you know I I Am totally in favor of judge Kavanaugh I I think it's really a disgrace that that\nDemocrats ... ... there's no merit to this complaint she has all of that people should fads were there say they weren't there then and what she's talking about including her best girlfriend\nI mean [laughter] you know something that happened to her but it wasn't Brett Kavanaugh and it should never can come to national TV worldwide TV gets crazy things have really disgraceful in her essay and handle the problem is there's like ... out of the additive bat\nIt Hail Mary they ever come up with anything to stop\nYou know she was a week ago about a week ago Monday I came back to the program after being down in Ohio you\nAnd I was reading a lot on the way back because my wife is driving and I said look at these your books that are now on here from Dr Ford\nAnd if you look at it there was a very party like atmosphere she was part of it and you're going back and looking at all there's there's no end jelly kids in high school you know these kids are all out there taking what they can do and the thing about it is a darker Ford\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh they were ... miles apart they would not have a\nTheir paths would not have cross but she was from Columbia, Maryland he was from another school I'm In far apart but it's unlikely that they would have gotten together\nMhm and it was\nIt ... and the thing that she has no facts here from the house she got there how she got home she had given it where it was how do you think that you know when it was you know what year it was that she didn't never friend brought to the national attention should have just been you know putting a circular filing cabinet and that was at\nMy ah my thoughts on it is that uh you know this this lady has got lots of a deep troubled thoughts and a younger age kids come back and what it for whatever reason she's just really remembering things that didn't have that's my that's my take on it 'cause I Know she's got nothing I mean where are you going to take it from here\nYou you don't have you don't even know where you're going to worried occurred\nIt's just a vicious attack from the Democrats they don't want a cat a constitutional judge and the Supreme Court at that they want somebody who can make it out according to their rent and you know what I wanted to bring out one other point I\nI was watching um my my friend Hannity antsy and he had a guest on and he has an African American gas he's conservative and he's on frequently but I Can't think of his name now it's certainly not that one that it wants Hispanic anyway but\nYou know he gave me a startling fact that justice Don history and I thought maybe I don't know if you've heard of it\nBecause the last was it last night or some other do now\nIt was like a week ago I just haven't been able to call you but um he said that you get a bunch of statistics about the African American you know a community and that's what he said that\nThere were more a black children being raised in a home and it to parent home during the days of slavery than there are now in our inner cities and I just was astonished by that and um and now the parents weren't married because they weren't allowed to get married as slaves but\nBut these kids were actually better off in motion LA I'm you know just having their God there and I have quite a few things myself I Know how much young boys and look up to their father they do everything to please their father they\nPlay harder it's sports where they they work harder in school for their dad they stab to travel to for the I'm going to go back out that they're they're devastated\nFlu you know what just said I'll just give you my brief comments here if you go back and look at the Nineteen forties in the Nineteen fifties\nThere were it was a despicable lifestyle that we had for black Americans here yet they thrived um because they had jobs and because they cared about their families they were very close to their families\nI don't think I don't think they automatically change just because of the sixties came into fashion what they change was when people started taking the father out of the house and saying that he's no longer necessary that women can have babies and that they can be paid and this could be a way of life\nWell the husband was no longer a central part to that family and that's one of the things that are on because if you go back and I I'd love to watch um the old baseball stuff and you go back and you see the Kansas City monarchs when we didn't allow African American players to play\nIn the American or the national league but you had people that were so proud of the Kansas City monarchs leave for black African American families and they were terrific baseball players\nThey they have their own communities because the husband for whatever reason was a ... the bread winner of that family and we kept families intact you know we've all lost an African American and Hispanic White America whatever we've all all all lost a little bit\nYou know you can succeed without having a father in the family but it's a lot harder as you said I mean it it is\nMuch much harder emotionally and financially you name it\nYeah you got it All right thank you Susan thank you bye\nPleasure thank you very much five Seventy WKBD on um I haven't told your Kelly story yesterday and I usually do that by now a Amanda in Derek or the subject of the story they have a hole in the whole it's gone now\nBut they

believe one where she had throughout the whole thing she not warm where she said that I Believe\nHer stuff she was afraid to fly well no apparently she not\nSecondly she went to a party but there was no need to take care of her thing and she didn't know how she got there and then she said when she got home\nSomebody took her face it okay if I don't ... they actually said okay\nSo either that she didn't want to let you name it didn't really happening or\nI mean yeah they what the crime rate and our stories getting\nCan we be mistaken about her flying though maybe she changed her mind and just learned you know ... to be a generous here because she said she didn't want to fly didn't want to be investigated and uh\nThey said well we'll go to you but here now she's been flying all over the country so she's got a claim that I Am part yeah I you know what I think the thing is going to find nothing you know they use the term nothing burger I think you're going to find out that\nThere is no more investigation needed I Do have I have a correct one thing that ... well thinking about it I'm the one caller earlier said that Brett Kavanaugh had volunteered to take a lie detector tests and from what I remember\nA capital he was asked about the Republican supporting yourself edition of the Supreme Court a bet resisted further investigation I don't think he ever agreed to take a lie detector to just to be in a you know in good stead with the facts but go ahead\nI Can't remember what she has ... here's another thing that really really young when she went to the grocery store and that mark ... she ran up going to get high\nAnd eat like a dose and I'm thinking well wait a minute when you look at it and you'll be running in the opposite direction if he thought somebody who was laughing at you and hold and you know I mean come on why would you go and I wondered why ... act like aren't\nYou know that's the beauty of talk radio we can speculate about this but it is\nThe other thing too is that the did mark judge even know her\nI mean I think the fact that she spoke to him that why would you get from it that they were traumatized and you build up your family and say Hi\nAnd that and there's more than one and they complain about the pets you don't mind on every single wind ...\nYours so great for being here and I believe you before they even hurt our ten at night so that

lawyers\nDon't let us go back to this will be number one I I can understand that because you have to treat people with respect that claimed to have been the victim of of the salt\nSo you you do that and the Republicans were treading very thin ice there because you know they look like a a bunch of people that are ganging up on the women would that was there couldn't be further from the truth when you think about it um they're talking about\nWhite men as being in general the perpetrators and now they're even bringing race into this on why white men would be allowed to do this in fairness I must take other call Sandy I thank you for yours\nAnd our next call is Lisa in the Nancy ... Lisa go ahead please\nMe how's your finally saw I hear\nA lot of people saying that he's lost his um whatever his personality or whatever they say because it is and I don't really agree with that because there's no evidence and there's no reason for him losing anything and that\nHe's had a pretty lofty reputation and people are saying that it's now been a solid\nYeah but I don't see that at all in fact I think that Democrats have lost a lot you August is anybody so that you\nKnow and you know I I kind of a you know I see right now where the Democrats were out here they are turning whole swaths of people against them and they're talking about the election coming up here unless it's simply going to be in the east coast in the west coast boat I really don't see\nHow in God's green earth this serves them you're just tears the country apart and I think you're going to you know him when Brett Kavanaugh made an impassioned plea on Thursday Afternoon I sat in my car and I listen to the program and I listen to a guy next to this case fighting for his virtual life\nThis guy he has what whatever he has done in his life he feels motivated to go out there in lay his entire soul out there and bury his soul and I thought the tears were real I mean but that's that's me a lot of ... lot of people don't feel that way\nWe are well I yeah there's some truth to that that I Do know that all of us are sooner or later ...
