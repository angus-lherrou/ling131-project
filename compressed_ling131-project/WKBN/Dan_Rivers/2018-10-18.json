Nineteen sixty\nFive seven\nSherrie Westin president this morning cleaning he may call up the military to quote close our southern border NBC's Karen ... is the president is watching a caravan of migrants headed for the U.S border\n\nTrump's comments would be that we will go to the border and generally active duty military cannot be used for domestic law enforcement that's generally true but Trump may be able to deploy the national guard which is administration said that's the plan\n\nHere's a here's my thinking on this and I love I Love trial and error and things you know for example right now Canada they're\nBlowing doing a big trial and error thing they have completely legalize pot\nSo you could have an ounce of pot in Canada and it's not going to cost you any jail time this will give us an idea if in fact it works for other states Michigan is talking about it too so you know trial and error go out there and throw it up against the wall see if it sticks\nWell how about this\nWhat if we did deploy the national guard as per the law active military typically can't be used I don't know But Trump's comments at first the channel if people wondering if he meant staffing the border with active duty\nOr mobilizing the national guard is probably what he's going to do National Guard members they can be deployed by either a state governor or a precedent and that's usually a domestic emergency\n[noise] well it just so happens that we have a caravan that is winding its way through South America or through Central America right now and they are heading toward Mexico with their ultimate goal to get into the United states why do I say that well\nNumber one if they are fleeing the drug lords in Honduras\nHaven't they basically done that if they've got and pass the drug lords and they've gotten past that people have got up from Honduras do they have to continue no\nReally trying to go for the ultimate plan and that would be to end up in the United states\nSo what do you think is it worth a trial to go out here and see what homeland security can do with three or four thousand national guardsmen and you can rotate them in and out\n\nThere was a press conference back in April and a Christian Nielsen then said Trump directed her department and the defense department to work with the governors to deploy the national guard to the southern border\nDonald Trump is saying he's ready to do it now she said Trump would signed a proclamation to that effect\nThat has occurred yet ... says April but today he brings it back up\nSo isn't it time to really give this a shot I mean even Nancy Pelosi this should so this should a server issue she's talking about Donald Trump he's just building a tower to his own manhood and how he's a bigger boy and he can how big a boy who's meanwhile he's about six three\nUm that he wants to go out and he can build this\nDeployment could begin immediately according deals in the national guard would offer US Customs and\nBorder protection officer support they would have surveillance for them but wouldn't this be a lot better than going out and saying okay we're going to build a border wall tomorrow\nBack there is a history for this too because President Bush\nHe deployed six thousand to the southern border to support the border patrol in two thousand six that was in response to request from Arizona California New Mexico and Texas and uh they said hey we need help down here\nSo it's a good move for Donald Trump what do you think we'll take your calls so they'd they'd seven to nine nine nine seven seven under the operation jumpstart troops offered engineering aviation and I'm identification\nOf these ... and you don't stop\nIn them and entertaining them under the Bush administration border patrol were tasked with conducting arresting seizures at the border so they can do a lot\nThe ... the actor recently or that\nThat is an act that goes back to well really that the infancy of our country back in the Eighteen hundreds the late Eighteen hundreds and they decided that they would restrict the military from engaging in civil law enforcement\nSo basically you can't go back here and have troops but you can do it to the letter of the law if you use National Guard or the military doesn't appear to have a direct legislative mandate to protect or patrol the border\nThat's what a contract congressional research has reported back in Thirteen [noise]\nBut ... does it bars the army and air force from being deployed to execute laws unless otherwise authorized by Congress or the constitution so possibly that is what Trump is waiting for he's waiting for someone to come forward and say oh you know what\nWe have now got a Congress that is going to allow us to do that we've now got a Senate that's going to allow us to do that would that pass let's take some calls on this Donald Trump bringing up the southern border guard the coast guard task defending the country's maritime borders they operate under homeland security\nBut it's under the Navy's control during times of war\nMilitary personnel acting in a passive capacity Mayo says law enforcement authorities and not run afoul of policy kind of taught us\nLet's go to Jeff first Jeff your attorney is it now time for Donald Trump to make good on the promise of the southern border and make sure that it is secure\nAbsolutely but if my memory serves me correctly didn't President Eisenhower and President Kennedy both federal wise the national guard to enforce immigration and the south\n[noise] ah yeah I mean but you know I think did they have to have congressional approval of that not that I'm aware of now\n... so you're saying that in order to restore due to restore or any kind of security they were able to deploy troops over the United states without going martial law\n... president has been spent already you know the president and then it started at ... I remember seeing video when I was a kid of a you know in the same on the news for more than that is holders with expand that from their rifles and her family\nOr a enforcing the immigration laws which were great but I mean there's a way around it and the president the commander in chief pace it's got that responsibility\nI gotta I kind of like the idea of trial like this I mean what would we looked like with a secure border right\nYeah I mean we haven't had one in I mean this is nothing new we have had immigration reform back\nIn the fifties back in the sixties and the eighties\nAnd the only thing that it never gets taken care of it is in fact in force in the war and and illegals continue to come across the border then so uh uh you know this is nothing to do\nIs try I yeah I you know I I Hope somebody goes to that debate with a chimney Ryan and the the there is actually going to be in our community next uh you know it is ... ... and asked him if he's willing to take these people and in her house if he thinks it's so valuable and you'll be interesting to see\nThe question's been asked a lot mostly they they don't um my community ... let me get some more calls in here here's John in Mercer county John\nHow are we doing hey John what do you think it is a dime or what you should we try this\nWell one of the only reason that I voted for Trump was for that wall I spent Twenty years dealing with a missing and Exploited Children and there was a study out there that doesn't get much publicity people can look it up it's all factual six year study we thought that the a thousand cases of\nChild abuse from the church over fifty years was terrible but in this study they document a thousand cases week of illegal immigrant pedophiles on American children and you can look it up but it's all documented is one of the top crime a violent crime investigators in the country\nThat Russia for him and her name as a Sherman S.

know ... just a bad acting of Saudi Arabia it's hard to believe in this world that you would go to an embassy in target somebody and tortured and killed him but that appears to what what has happened right\nThat and it looks as though at least at this point this morning Turkish investigators are expanding their probes a for cause soggy to include at least\nTwo wooded areas outside of this temple where they think the body or the body parts as the case may be may have been dropped off and hitting on some level so uh they they believe that Saudi agents inside the consulate\nAccording to what they send an audio tape that they have not only tortured him the moment he walked through the doors at the consulate began\nCutting off fingers and then that eventually led to a beheading and then

that they're saying told everybody in the room to do that and then put headphones on himself because you don't want to hear what was about to happen\nYou know crazy anyway so this so I guess the next question is how do we still maintain a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nThat's a fantastic question that I think is yet to be answered I think what happens over let's say let's say first of all let's say if the Turkish justice minister says that\nWhile this investigation is ongoing they expected they'd be concluded soon so let's say that soon says and the next five days let's say in the next five days they conclude this thing they release some information to the to the ... and people that are involved in this um that's going to be over the next five days very imperative to see how Saudi Arabia reacts are they going to be\nSomebody who comes forward with this we already know that my palm pale and meeting with the crown prince while he was in Saudi Arabia warn the print that the prince was going to have to own this situation and that every fact was eventually going to come out so anything you say right now anything you do right now a will be reflected upon ones that information does come out so\nI I think whatever happens over the next five days as I'm throwing that as the deadline though that's not the case but over that those five days from Saudi Arabia and what they would put President Trump through and trying to defend or throw some honoring the direction of one of our allies that's going to be the big question here\nWell you know here's the thing to Michael if you're thinking about Saudi Arabia the you know in their place in the world they have just taken a big step backwards because they're now trying to rebuild their country and say we're going to do high tech\nOr we're not just about oil any longer that we're trying to allow women to drive what [noise] what I mean number one you have a loss of life in on any level that's that's sad but the writing

see right now but\nThat will get that temperature up there and uh it should be a a fairly nice afternoon then that'd be great art Jay Leno supposed to call us a little bit and hopefully that will go well and we'll get a hold of him um\nI was just looking at some of the other things that\nWe haven't really been able to get to today and up one of them is the issue one and I have the complete text of it and if I have an opportunity I promised I tried to get that out of jail primaries the ten minutes maybe will be able to get to that issue one a little bit later in the program\nAnd Jay will be calling us uh he actually called early next to Jay call me back and five minutes and he graciously said no problem no problem for\nRivers whatever is he the guy is introducing me Sunday night absolutely he called her early yeah yeah and let's get him on man see we'll see what he's up to us I wanted to call us back you know I'm kind of interested in you know he does like two hundred shows a year you see constantly going around writing material everyday\nOr Disney recycle it I understand that Leno is among comics ate very prolific writer\nOr I've heard that when they you know they did a history of comedy thing on one of the cable channels that we enjoy very much by the way so at least they were very he's very he's always turn it out all these things that we say off air we should be writing these ... things down\nYeah yeah well it's a good thing we have so many things off air we'd be out of a job oh gosh I don't want to be airing our dirty laundry out in\nPublic Dan hey you know folks are if you can give to the American Red Cross the blood drive is coming up on the nineteenth one o'clock that is tomorrow afternoon here at the heart complex\nAre you writing things down all the above\nWell a little bit of I tend to record things I'm dyslexic so I don't really write a whole lot down you know when I was a kid I was I was ah my mother oh so you're gonna have to work harder to the other kids to get the same thing sure\nAnd then out that that seemed like a fair thing I remember going to the improv and the comedy clubs that you know you line up at like six o'clock on Sunday the eleven o'clock or ... people in front of me go that sucks I'm not waiting longer\nMove up and and it was thought of that\nIt's it's sort of work for me but yeah that's what I Do I just sort of your job things down in ... in in a in a test things out and civilians as a regular mean well just to see if it is funny and all that kind of thing and then see if it works you know\nNo no no particular formula to it but uh you know it's just amazing no the the late night has changed so much and it seemed like a small mostly all politics yours is kind of a mixture of politics when you\nDon't you know the weird thing we live in now is the idea that uh\nIf you don't like a entertainers politics you don't like them you know um\nYou don't like their music anymore because they are for this person or that person I I mean when I did the Tonight Show I always enjoyed it when I got hate mail from both sides wellness line of you and your Republican friends well I Hope you and your democratic but he's I mean you know and the thing you get the same way that you get each letter on the same thing all good just means I'm doing my job because\n... each side he's the only way you know now ... everybody just kind of doing the same job I mean it's hard to do the same joke\nBut yeah it is I mean like everybody last night you know I'm Talking about you know whatever went on in Washington DC and they all have their different take on it\nBut um it's kind of a a lot of seemed us but it's ... it's almost all politics every once in a while you'll see somebody throw in some pop culture but most of his politics as politics just easy because it changes much\nYeah I mean you know in the old days the punch line would be like the president being with a porn star oh now that President\nBush [laughter] where do you go if you take this you know where they\nWere the ones that are called upon the horse faith you know I I don't know how you get I don't know what when you go that's funnier than that you know I I mean it's just like what the what I mean it's I'm not ... it it yeah it it\nIt said the people think oh it must be so easy now it it's not because you know comedy is funnier when you take it from\nThe conservative to the outrageous yeah when it when it's outrageous start with I don't know where you go you know it's it's hard to\nExaggerate beyond you know what actually you know I used to watch house of cards and go all the stupid this could never happen now it looks like a documentary you know yeah I Know no okay\nYeah isn't that amazing what they're doing now with Netflix and Amazon and stuff I mean it's a [laughter] I don't know ... might be a big threat to the way we watch TV\nOr you're just watching different television you know I mean I have to admit I have a hard time getting through the network TV with the commercials yeah I mean it's like ... and you know they they're so good at making a thirty second seemed like a minute commercial because there's so many visual images of it that\nTwo or three thirty second commercial seem like ten or twelve minutes yeah and in the late\nNight you know they've actually increase the number of that you can have I mean that break from like eleven fifty to twelve or one or whatever it is oh my God it's like nine minutes the commercials ... it's pretty\nCrazy and you're going to go back and get thirty seconds of the content that you've teased and maybe it's all that good I mean\nI Know I Know is that I mean I noticed when I started an hour drama would run forty\nSix men now they run forty two minutes something like that\nYou know now here's another thing too is that you know I came in here and I do the show eight to twelve Monday through friday we have a\nAn entire group here that you know we're here and you don't have that structure any longer but you still go out and you do about an hour and a half show you something about what we'll do you have an hour after hour forty but you come back and you'll do that show and you know you you have complete confidence that you can do this\nAnd can you pull from material\nUm maybe things come that you hadn't thought about for years and they just come flowing back in or are you pretty much I'm laid out oh now you're going to do the show\nWhat little bit of both I mean the fun thing about doing a live show is you know when you do the Tonight Show you do different material in the same place every night yeah you're on the road you do the same material a different place every night\nBut the nice thing is you get a chance to open it up and to lead a breed I mean the number of times you come up with a joke on the Tonight Show and they take out I got a better punch line this is but yeah we can't do it again we did it allows you can change it you can open it up a little\nBit let him breathe add some more elements to it and you can do this subtle stuff you know one of my favorite comedians is always Bob Newhart ... cars Bob could always find exactly\nThe right word or the right phrase I mean one of my favorite things and this is so tiny but it's just an example of why like Bob Newhart bombed like you do bit about\nThe uh first astronaut to make as to try to contact you know ... and he comes back to earth and as a press conference and one of the reporters says some ... how far ahead of us are they\nAnd Bob says about six week [laughter] and you go up and throw it out there this week is just the perfect because things that we can see you can't quite reach out and there's money is not\nTwo weeks is not a year that my six week they have the right id ... no matter how fast you're running you're not going to catch up with six weeks and it just makes me laugh and that's what's fun you get to just find the right word you know doing a comedy show is really it's really the economy of war and\nYou know you can customize your show here and say well you know young so you get rid of all that graft and crime and got rid of all of that stuff in here recently we've had a former mayor has been indicted a we have a\nA one of the his chief of staff of financial guy and all this stuff is so things are repeating here and you know so so that would probably be good and then you can say we have a mild mannered football coach in both ... see him on the sidelines how he goes nuts [laughter] what do you ever do that you're trying to customize to the area that you're in\nIt's a little tricky because you ... if you don't know the act amendment you know I I Do a lot of corporate events ... and say oh we got a guy in our office one time as I was doing their thing or are they said oh this guy's the big ladies' man so if you have any about sex jokes about women and\nGuy may get Bob Walker yeah All right I don't know about what we're going to say that because you're Bob Walker bigger laugh you know if I Move along the Bob Walker third time I did this woman who wrote down the river crying won't walk his wife didn't know that he was\nThe ... and ... and everybody goes oh man we didn't know she was common and I'm like guys where do you\nWhat are you doing to remember it was hilarious I mean we're color so every\nTime I was doing a thing for first alert as a you know fire alarms and all kinds of stuff and\nThey have a lot of ex cop you know like I said oh it'll pick on this guy Bob Johnson whenever it was and after the second time the guy goes all\nWhite picking on what am I to say you're just your friends tell me what what\nWhat what friends is that why would I chose to be singled out but not Sarah which have a ... and this guy was so paranoid I mean it was just like a crazy fares as I said you know someone else I Know that people I Know circumstances I I Try to get a little careful of that\nJay Leno's coming to town on Sunday night I had the pleasure of introducing the gentleman and will be it's damn auditorium and go to the box office get tickets on line or you can call
