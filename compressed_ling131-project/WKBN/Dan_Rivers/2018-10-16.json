morning we're with you until twelve noon today and a President Trump is a busy week ahead of the situation in Saudi Arabia is still up in the year\nAnd he had the first lady ... has just returned from the hurricane zone meanwhile I'm Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren one million dollars is what she wants no she says that she is Native American\nAnd Michael what you do did she did she go to ancestry as it is that what she did [laughter]\nShe ... she did not do ancestry she also did not go to a twenty three and me she did not use those in fact\nShe went to one of the higher sources and probably want to I Would imagine in one of the most expensive test you can do a which was done through the professor of biomedical data science at\nStanford University so I didn't I don't remember seeing that as a gift possibility the holiday season any place but then what we're looking at here is I think not just a Senator Warren trying to attempt to neutralize President Trump and the attacks calling her Pocahontas but also\nBecause this was done in sequence with the website and a video that was released by Elizabeth Warren I think this has every indication that this is her kind of dipping her telling the twenty twenty presidential race\nOh so she's going to be one of the candidates out there uh I'm trying to think who else has shown an interest at this point Joe Biden possibly can\nBut he still says no but then says wait and I I think that there's some interest there from him I just don't know what level or extent that interest is we also know that\nThere are some uh some younger senators the Kamala Harris says the Cory bookers who may be interested I think we'll know more apt to the midterms it unless we start to see some more releases like this where I I think this fits in perfect leave for the timeframe that Senator Warren needed to do this because you had the president over a month ago\nChallenging her and saying if you take a DNA test when he was at one of his rallies you take a DNA test and it proves that you had any Native American blood and you all donate a million dollars to a charity you're choosing\nSo here she is now hoping to sort of eliminate that element as a discussion that might move forward into twenty twenty electoral David debates so here she is trying to get that information out there she took the DNA test I'm guessing shortly after the president made that challenge\nBecause this wasn't you know like I said at twenty three me where you get your your results mailed back to when I'm On this is something that was a little bit deeper than that so\nAs soon as you get this information she shares with the Boston Globe or they report on it and indeed according to the biomedical data staff they say that\nUm she showed in on it and mixed Native American ancestry in her genes and her pedigree that they're saying is six to ten generations old which is you know a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty years ago so possibly as as far back as Seventeen hundred but it is definitively there in her genes so\nThat said I guess if your kind of just going by the letter of the law maybe President Trump should pay up on that President Trump denying and said that he would have to apply the test\nAnd that uh according to him when he said there was one\nA one thousandth of a chance that she was or was she was one one thousand a native America some level that kind of goes against what they said in Stamford as well which it could be that high sure it can be about low rather at one one thousand but it could also be one thirty seconds so again not full blooded by any means but a part of her blood there\nYeah that's true so maybe President Trump does lose this bad\nShe do you think about this Michael this just on a a a level I think you have to be one eighth to join the ...\nElite club here too you know to be to be Irish and yeah and I can you know you're talking about an eighth or a quarter or something like this but when you have something that goes back in the best possibility be one thirty second then to be a lot lower than that you wonder why someone would put themselves out there\nBut for those people who can't even get first responders there all of that is going to be a big issue here that we're going to hear about over the coming weeks and months\nYeah Michael just briefly before we have to go and you do to them what's the latest on Saudi Arabia\nAre waiting to hear what Saudi Arabia is willing to admit to right now we know that yesterday's kind of been this back and forth where they were saying they didn't have anything to do with it or the king said he didn't know any knowledge of this happening in fact it could have been a couple of road killers and President Trump pass that information along after a phone call with the king and the president indicating we're going to get to the bottom of the sumo figure it out\nSent my palm pay over my palm pay I went to Saudi Arabia had a meeting with the king for Fifteen minutes it's taken that long down rivers if we were talking about uh the baseball game last night Fifteen minutes is not a lotta time to get any information out of anybody but that's how long like Mike Pompeo was able to meet with the king in the meantime\nSaudi Arabia said that they feel that they may be able to open up and say that\nThe death of the Saudi journalist is the best of a botched interrogation on their behalf and they haven't released that statement yet but they say they're still planning on it\nSaid part about it you're a man has lost his life and and apparently he was doing it you know just to get divorced papers finalized and you know lost in all of the diplomatic ah nuances is a guy who lost his life and a battle and now we're trying to figure out a way to save a\nMulti million dollar defense contract that's kind of what it comes down to it's very sad\nAnd what I heard from Marco Rubio's he doesn't care if it's a journalist for a newspaper or the guy who was the janitor at the Washington rose you're talking about someone's life who was brought under false circumstances and then lost their life out of conflict of some\nOf an ally of ours in a country that we deal with on a regular basis and that needs to be addressed you put one of those things are the question if you get all of those put together that becomes a much bigger and much more important question to answer\nYou will said Michael as a pleasure to have you on your on five Seventy ... later this week you got to enjoy the rescuing\nThank you very much that's Michael power

Katie\nI'm sharing passed in calling for answers today in Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a reporter\nThis lead you to believe Dan a or a leads to the question as to whether there will be renewed interest here in the United states since\nAfter all are they're already thirty states in the district of Columbia who have medicinal marijuana legalize nine\nStates in DC a recreational marijuana legalized even though it remains a federal offense and marijuana remains a schedule one drug under federal guidelines\nRight you know what I Would like to look at bill first of all maybe you know the answer to this is Canada I'm under the influence of organized drug gangs bringing in drugs to Canada right now\nWell I Would imagine they are uh I don't think there's a country in the world that can escape the cartels and an illegal drug trade and that's one of the reasons that uh Justin Trudeau gave for legalizing and he said he wants to cut down on the illegal drug trade in Canada and he said doing this show\nUh basically take care of the black market for drug I go to if there is a big difference a year from now I Would think that there would be a lot of renewed interest in that in the United states because that's the big thing the scourge of the drug gangs that are bringing these places that are built I Know you're busy today I appreciate the time you have given us you've given us a lot to chew on\nYou got to Dan anytime my pleasure our bills in for NBC Radio news on by Seventy WPN and that we get to topic so let's just take off all those and then I have another first of all your response here to what we are now leading looking yet\nAnd that we can chew on both of these for a little bit here another caravan\nHeading toward the United states and again\nWhat responsibility does Mexico have what responsibility these are our allies right you know we're not at war with South America and Central America and Mexico\nYet if these people traipsing through that area with the hopes of getting to the United states or Canada what is the responsibility of Mexico to turn them around\nAnd as I said on you know just the brother and sister level here you think how we feel ... you know inconvenienced on every thing that\nHappens to us here we can only imagine that people are picking up with the shirt on their back and they're heading toward what they hope would be a better life that's crazy [noise] and then\nWhat Justin Trudeau is doing now in Canada can somebody told me\nIf in fact you visit Canada now and will you go on a holiday to Canada you know it's closer than Colorado right\nSo if in fact you are now going to Niagara Falls\nAnd you say well you know what the falls on the American side are just not that good you know ... it's kind of a beat up old town Niagara Falls right and you go back and you look at rip police believe it or not there's got to be more well there is more\nYou always say well we're going to go over to the Canadian side because we like the Canadian side even though it costs a little bit more now there will be some people will you I asked you really you know visit Niagara Falls with the hope of being able to smoke pot without the chance of being prosecuted\nIt's an excellent idea I mean you figure they've already got the ... dean there too so you get good munchies to go with it\nYou know [laughter] not calling I Am not going to Canada does if I've got to smoke marijuana I don't think it's that big of a deal to get it here in the states number one\nAnd number two of the penalty is not all that big I don't really

she was a nurse office I she she shut down there I think about four years\nUm and on and and she didn't come back and ... and there are number of American women that were down there with her at the time some of them married Honduran men not and and stay there um but\nWhat do they actually do I mean when you're a missionary I Would imagine I can understand teaching and things like that but what do they they do that they couldn't do for themselves\nI I Believe that it it seemed to me like she was involved with like the school nurse and I'm ... and she was involved in the church\nThat I got to know does she's really doing this other good neighbor hard oh just down there with the with the shrine this group and yet as you've talked to her what was her impressions after she had been there

of pure communism in ... in Cuba where there are basically living in the Nineteen forties or even worse or the fifties\nBut you're saying that that concept even though it's not pure communism in places like Honduras and Guatemala the socialism it permeates and that's what keeps them down\nAnd and you know just just recently and that ... that was a peaceful protests by Susan assistant several months ago and the government just are on them I'm just you know but look at look at the civil rights but what the human rights violations in these countries and hope they don't like what you're saying\nThey frame and then you can rotten jail and you know and they in may in our country and we have these people that are that are just that's occurring in the frat flag attacking people on property destruction and they have no idea\nWell I mean to to just my own personal then you the last week or so I've been reading Hillary's book and what happened and the only thing I can ascertain from that is that she wants to undo\nAll of the games that we have made here in the last two three four years where we have jobs that are abundant right now\nAnd for some reason she wants to come back and say you know what I don't want to go to Bernie's pure capital or socialism but I Want some form of that where we want to continue to help people and give them a hand up I think it's very frightening to think that\nThe areas of California and even some egos ultra Manhattan even in New York\nThose people are living poorly but they're getting along but I think most of them are almost third world in some of the north shouldn't say most but many of them like an east Harlem and do you go to the portions of Los Angeles we're seeing this already in our country\nAnd I don't know is that what the Democrats want to embrace\nCall older than the Democrats you know Democrats as you know\nHer or die off and they're they're embracing the rabbit the radical left off yeah they're they're they're losing their lives is they're going to lose I have a feeling they're going to live that they kind of this and that term you\nAnd you know what Hillary's next thing is that she wants to undo the electoral college and that's for sure she so so you know we want to popular votes but we're we're not in so she wants to get rid of the electoral college and that means that you know what if you're in Iowa or if you're in South Dakota you may not even vote right\nOne thousand eight hundred and fifty points Gretzky retired in Nineteen Ninety nine holding records for most career goals most

I got to come through the living room to get out or where the fire places\nI think it came down the flu or the the the chimney and got through my stove pipe\nOr a is that does that chimney and flew still open\nNo it's it's close I mean I I got the stove in there\nAnd saying you could you could you go up on the house and put a piece of wood down through the chimney that will give him a chance to climb back either\nOh this is talk to him they\nTold no no no and\nBut but this guy woke me up at two thirty in the morning I felt some cool Paul's run across the side of my head a and when I was laying in bed and I said I don't remember getting a kitty so\nI I I raise up and I see\nThis little squirrel looking back at me at the floor of the\nBed you did not you're all I can tell about getting creamed out wow this guy was too close for comfort your your your sleeping in the middle night\nOkay here here's here's what I Would do well I'm just thinking to myself I Would go ahead and said alive trap I Would find of some kind of a trap and put some food in and try to grab you and your house\nI don't want to let it do I I got it cornered no no no but I don't want to let it let's again I got it on duct tape would gorilla tape\nAnd and that's going to be somebody's going to die in there and they just think well\nThen I can open it up I'm not letting this guy loose again they'll catch it flooded later ran right through between my legs\nAre and I told you was but you can go out and you get one of these uh these have a heart traps to find out what squirrels like and he will go in there and then you can go out and you can do a catch and release\nI I like my I did that I'm going to find some weak I Need someone has some week I don't smoke but you know I might start\nNo you know what you're your own worst enemy I Can't help you thank you Denny or their egos a gave him a way out and that's to go find out what squirrels really like put it in that little a little trap and he will eventually walk out getting a trap and you can do a catch and release ...

Rated for a category\nWell the newer homes that have been built rated for category three hurricane which means that needed to withstand a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and I saw that home that still it and what they've done to anchor it\nThere's a fighter and it's a different levels with no ... and what not\nIt was it was rated the stand worse than a category five hurricane at which the differences wings of a hundred and Seventy five miles an hour\nAnd a lot of what needs to be done is before the homes are refill committed ... upgrade their building codes are first and foremost this fire or anything that's where you felt\nYou know to to ... go by the newer guidelines or guidelines but I agree with you there's\nThere's a limit to what can be done but those communities are and and and elected politicians are going to have stuff\nOr do something that probably wouldn't be popular 'cause that's going to add to the cost\nOf ... you know what and Jeff in there or something you know it may be a little bit of a jealousy on our part here from time to time because I think oh my gosh you know I've been down there and I thought about living down there too but\nYou know they live in relative paradise with good weather you know ten or eleven months a year and then ... and they build very close to the ocean\nAnd sometimes we come back and say well they're gonna get a low cost loan or they're going to have their home to rebuild and even if their homes are not rebuild there is so much money that's coming from our federal government that I don't think that we can we can afford it\nI I agree I agree and then now it's time to uh uh for the uh you know those changes to a mate that yeah there is a cost of living in a while I guess what they consider paradise a with a\n... of the time to do that that technology access so those crowds cook the strength and then uh you know which a lot of stuff could be found in our community to strengthen the coats and the guideline bread and a and use that to even you know keep check on the life that's continues to grow and then that way but uh\nYeah ... well I even think about some of those homes that um I used to visit down in Naples and they used to have these trailers just outside of Naples I mean they wouldn't have a shot in health surviving doesn't that All right I mean how is it I guess that'd be one way to go build something so cheaply that you don't care that'd be one way to doing it\nRight right that just don't keep a lot of evidence there that's for sure\nYou know you got it [laughter] All right Jeff nice to talk to you and thank you very much a Jesse I'm you you've been in Key West you you have a home or don't you\nUh yeah yeah then yeah actually I'm right outside of us and we had known her for a couple of weeks for a little thing called fantasy about\nOh I'm Down here okay what's on\nDon't adult or Halloween\nNo that's fun that's fun yes yeah yeah we do that here in Youngstown too but we just dress up like a bum you know we're not going to go to a bar but ... ... what's your whole built liked it down and ...\nIt's built like you said it's a got concrete pillars just like it does go on a bridge that goes down to bedrock which bedrock down here is like a eight foot\nGround level as well grade is not real deep and then about the last ... the they haven't cage inside the poured concrete pillar than they have a cage then about the last six feet up they have a um\nA piece of metal or a big piece of steel becomes I'm Tom yeah comes off the top of the uh the pillar and it ... to\n... to buy a

have the choice or a laminated against each other so that there are there for wide for why my guy should just to handle that kind of a that would almost take a you know too strong men to even put up the Joyce right Oh absolutely yeah yeah sheep and Christmas so that in an age\nTo buy say five walls will double the plywood three quarter inch by what\nShe is and what are they doing with the roof noted that somebody said that they are putting down or they have a double roof type of thing from what I saw last night\n... ours is the metal roof but it's a really thick metal roof and the screws

think\nWell it's not up to me anyway what I heard runs but no but\n... don't you when you're ... you're a what a on your station\nI mean I think that there are a little less than conservative a column saying\nWell I mean it could be but I mean I've always been one that thought that marijuana should be decriminalized so I mean that's kind of falls into my my own thoughts I'm never half\nNot exactly the the conservative point of view I mean\nYou're going to find out that I'm an enigma because uh you know I go out and then I go some different ways sometimes because I've even considered that people would be better off if they were able to go to one of our hospitals and get a heroin fix rather than having that\nGreat with that too I well I mean I'm just saying you can't you can't really put me in

really need that many a commercial for a condom and\n[laughter] ... ... whoever whoever is whoever is selling those does I mean\nI I'm really but over the weekend I kept hearing you hear the commercial for marijuana and then it was followed by the condom commercials and I are several times now you know once\nWhen I was in high times is was the magazine that normally a propel I mean they were a proponent of of being able to legalize marijuana right yeah I Believe that's right\nYes yeah is that the the way it went and then the ... of the ... that that's something that we know and then there's all kinds of mail enhancement out there that has a big business the\nOnly thing missing is an ad for Cheetos a yeah\nI mean by the way what gets me and I I watched the the baseball playoffs yeah and and I had prime time you see a lot of\nCommercial for condom yeah maybe certainly and our kids are watching this maybe and I'm a liberal as they come down you know that but I don't think that maybe we should find somebody else to ever get further than that yeah you're wondering that particular uh\nNow that may be alarming but I'm more concerned about what is going to happen to the corner

appreciate your all the work that you do for our community your walk ... father at Britain's and that is St Augustine please support than they do such a fantastic job they really do [noise]\nAll right it is the Dan River is program and as I promised right here in my hand I Am going to tell you about\nThe Youngstown drinking water protection bill of rights and then I Want you to tell me if in fact you're considering voting for it\nAnd before you reject it out of hand they have got a number of votes over the years\nAnd there are commercials that are now running on the radio\nAgainst it\nHere was what part a says and this is the most important part all people of the city of Youngstown along with the ecosystems and natural communities within the city possess the right to clean water air in the soil\nI Would agree with that right we we we deserve that\nAnd they go on to say and to be free from activities that would violate this right and expose citizens to the harmful effects of contaminants in their water supply including but not limited to the drilling new wells\nIt's not for everybody but they're targeting Youngstown again the eighth time\nBriefly what they're saying that it's all people of the city of Youngstown deserve clean air and water\nTo that and but\nNot limited to we would prohibit drilling new wells or extraction of fossil fuels using any technology not previously used on existing wells and they're targeting fracking so what they're essentially saying in this is\nThat in the city proper there would be no drilling\nAnd I got to tell you what I don't think there's a lot of drilling going on here right now at all there's not much fracking going on in ... county there's some\nTo go to Belmont county is a different story\nWhen they fully developed that they may move north\nThan they are going further and they're saying the disposal of any waste from fossil fuel so if you're going back here and you're going to have injection wells are going to make sure that those are going you wouldn't be able to store doing build deposit it you wouldn't be able to do injected you wouldn't be able to even transported in the city\nAnd that may even have further reaching um you know ramifications would endanger the pike mill\nBecause they're saying you wouldn't be able to deposit store treat inject\nDisposal\nTransporter possessing of wastewater produced water frack water Brian drill cutting\n... ...\nWould that go over to the manufacturer maybe not maybe that's why they took it out of there no much those substances that have been used as a result of the extraction of fossil fuels\nSo eighth time coming up and you know here's the thing about it folks you can't if if you believe that fracking and fossil fuels are going to be part of our future you really can't afford\nTo stay home and not vote this down because what you're looking at right now is these people tend to get a lot of votes they have gotten votes in the past and they'll do it again\nAnd water these times you know it you know they're they're like persistent one of these times are going to say enough people stayed home get enough\nOf our people showed up in New now have a drinking water protection bill of rights which could be an economic inhibitor in Youngstown will see\nAny calls on that let me know seven to nine nine nine seven seven seven to nine nine nine seven

that Elizabeth Warren releasing the DNA showing the Native American industry as history would see you know Donald\nTrump back away from his protests about her heritage and he would lose the ability to
