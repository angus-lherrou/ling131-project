people that um you know in the formation of our country\nThat would be at each other's throat and save the rotten those things and they had cartoons that were really quite a while I mean they they just ratcheted up the uh the vitriol to another level\nThen we are in in my opinion what happened is that we basically you know what he's got the I just you just gotta Fleischer the Saudi Arabia now

thing with a named Paula Jones\nThe president was titled telling Taylor Branch that you know Republicans were dressing up Paula Jones doing her hair over that it was part of the the conspiracy against him to make\nHer seem more palatable to the public\nAll the way through to the end where you had to apologize about or what have you know by lying and Monica Lewinsky\nAnd uh the ... the interpretation of branch that you know he didn't feel good and talking with the president that it was quite as sincere as he thought he should be so it's a it's this great insight of behind the scenes of everything else that was going on\nSo have you produced it an entire series or a how long is this a program that\nThis is one hour we uh we we have this is a we've done about a dozen of these for the Smithsonian Channel these kind of know narration no interview shows we have another one coming up by the way I'm from Cleveland originally I went to Kent State university right down the road from you guys and\nOne of our ah beyond this we're coming out in November I don't have the exact date but it's on the um Nineteen Seventy four senior tornado\nIf your listeners might remember that the it's called the tornadoes super outbreak and that's another one where we kind of a bring the past to life in a way that you're really not going to see anywhere else\nYou just shocked me when you tell me that that was Nineteen Seventy four it doesn't seem that long ago my God I'm\nAlways really remarkable yeah and we found some terrific footage that people will especially in Ohio and the mid west will uh if they don't remember a they're going to be shocked to see\nThe time just for people out there that are producing these kinds of things are thinking about doing this this the most of this stuff is not in the public domain right you have to get permission from CBS NBC anybody to cover [noise] use their their footage\nThat's correct or a ... you know a lot of other stuff that we use to get from news networks\nThe differences you know a lot of other documentaries they only use what we call the on air or what you would you would know the the caught pieces that are broadcast and we say we'd like the entire raw tape from which this came from and we still have to license it of course from these networks\nBut when tapes come into newsrooms\nAn editor quickly pulls a you know maybe four or five minutes off of a thirty minute tape it with tape back then and they take that tape out of their adding machines they put it on a shelf and there's twenty five minutes of history that's kind of just lost\nAnd what we do is we go through the rest of the footage to find a brand new ways of looking at stories that are very familiar\nWell you know in that regard than this will be somewhat new because you're right I mean most of the stuff that we get is a soundbite and typically a producer is in a hurry and sometimes they're just to make the eleven o'clock news or whatever deadline you know I here since the here's an angle that I had just thought about\nThis was prior to the Fox news network correct\nThat's correct there was no Fox News at the time so basic\nThis would be were three networks and CNN is that mostly were this what he's done from\nCNN and then that are really the records of the Starr Report itself which I gather you know it was voluminous or a you know in images and in sound recording you've got to remember the thing that brought the whole business down was\nA a woman named Linda trip who was a friend of Monica Lewinsky's\nWas afraid Linda was afraid she was going to be called in front of the star hearings for several different reasons and she was advised to start recording her phone calls with Monica Lewinsky which she did for several months and then the FBI\nSet up a sting operation where at a hotel in Washington DC Linda trip or a wire to meet with Monica Lewinsky\nAnd because we have this format of no narration into interviews you're able to hear a lot more than just a bite from those those tapes you're you're hearing two or three minutes at a time and you really start to get a sense of what was going on it is it's fascinating\nMm well so the thinking about it is that you you have all those people who you are really bringing us a new program do you ever sit back and think about the preponderance\nOf the of the\nEvidence in the footage and then the impeachment and Bill Clinton has gone on to another career in he is only in in in many regards your democratic circles he's considered a a statesmen of note using\n[laughter] yes he is a bad and I think beyond that there's there's so many characters that you're going to see in this film that are familiar to us today one of the things that we are there's several jaw dropping moments one is I didn't know that Bill Clinton used\nThe phrase make America great again as one of his campaign slogan that wasn't the slogan but we found speeches where he was saying that like\nWow he was using that phrase and by the way we have I researched that phrase because I wanted to see where it first started and actually it was Ronald Reagan that first use it and then we go forward and we found tape of\nMatt Lauer who was caught up in the me too movement of the last year\nInterviewing then businessman Donald Trump about his opinions of Bill Clinton\nAnd they're having Donald Trump say it's too bad this all happened because he could have been a great president\nUh so you get all of these cases that are familiar to us now it's remarkable actually\nAnd uh and they're all familiar in different reasons and certainly Clinton is still familiar and has become a statesman but at the time you you know people forget he actually was impeached by the house of representatives and went\nTo trial in Bennett\nOr you know I'm thinking about this year and there's people out there listening right now that probably are not all that familiar with it I mean if you're Twenty years of age like you're saying this was years ago\nI drank plowed through I just plowed through the Hillary book um what went wrong and I'm reading this book and going through this book and she's talking about\nShe's reunited with her best friend and a bill says I Would be the best candidate out there it builds a wonderful father nice reorganizing our library\nHeat is almost like they are back on the same page she has given all of Bill Clinton and they are destined to be together for life\nAnd she speaks of him very fondly and a ... there's a lot of lot of women in America that would say what the hell are you doing with this guy right\nAnd and you know and she's and she's in the middle of the feminist movement right because uh ... her book has has to do if you've read this book at all it's really about how we move women forward\nAnd you know here she's living with a guy that you know it has this checkered past who was impeached for these crimes against poll well impeach using PC was was not convicted\nBut direct you go back and you look up the bill Clinton is now kind of like considered ...\nYeah he is I mean you know ... it seems in some ways in a you know if your listeners tune in to say it's like the world kind of got flipped on its head there's a\nYou know we we found a sound bites or from the national organization of women are president Patricia Ireland talking about uh you know uh you know none of the women who spoke against the bill Clinton are to be believed\nWhich you know today is about a belief in women and what they have to say is tantamount and ... it's just\nIt's hard to put it into words how bizarre the whole thing was to put this together and try and figure out a you know if anything you'd get perspective on the past and how people wind up where they're at today\nAnd uh and you get to live through it in one hour of television and really get a good understanding of who these people were then and what they had to say and then you can draw your own conclusions we don't we don't try and make a point other than by the way if everyone has forgotten\nYou know we haven't cornered the market on chaos like we think we have there was complete chaos

seven thousand plus Central America refugees and asylum seeking people which he turned the mob as I said yesterday let's get rid of these euphemisms let's get rid of these little things called the caravan\nSome awful people coming to the United states\nIn here is where you really have to wonder stand why the wall would be so important if in fact Donald Trump had been given the go ahead and the funds\nOf what he had originally said a lot of people say well you know this is really low brow this is really high school stuff you want to\nBuild a wall you know needle wall all we need to do is have good patrols on the border\nWhere do you do when you have potentially seven thousand men women and children looking at you and they're marching toward you do shoe rubber bullets Adam issued water cannons Adam\nOr worse the seats position that's put us in\nSo now we're in a position of having to go back and say well now how are we going to deal with these people are we going to use lethal force to keep people out of our country\nI think you do\nSounds awful doesn't think about this if you don't have a country if you don't have a lock on your door you have no security\nSo this is what they're saying and I don't know you folks agree with me I I I think Louie, Louie Gohmert right you've got a mob of people that want to break into our country ... says this group are allowed to reach California\nI hear you very well thank you for that consensus I presume you're on the same page I'm looking for some people to that may disagree with is totally thank you for that um when I go back and I think about um whether or not you go to the border\nAnd you do this [noise]\nRemember you've got a sovereign country and if you don't protected you won't have one very law right we have put the we've gotta we've we've kind of put the military and a tough position\nI don't know what's going to come to that you know we're putting the cart before the horse these people may grow weary of getting here but I'm just going out to saying here's the current reality you got people that are heading for a gallon Texas I don't know if they're a month away\nBut we better be thinking about how we're going to deal with it right now let's continue here's our next call Hi good morning and welcome you are on five Seventy WPN\nWorn down is Dave from off the on hold waiting in relation to and\nThey you know if you talk talk to the older folks that came as concrete they'll tell you that they were anxious to learn the language to be able to communicate with people here sure and so and I\nGet so tired I go Home Depot or some of these big box stores you can see everything I end up with Spanish phasing out word I go down the aisle and that term all round English pays out English\nNow sort of border absolutely put troops on the border because after that is their primary a neat that you're used they are there to protect our homeland and have you can't protect them\nAs we've been trying to do now I mean I don't really agree with all these little war has no ... in the middle east and everything either\nBy their primary primary goal in primary you should be to protect all went okay now I Want to tell you that the uh Tim Ryan co sponsored a bill to practically take away your right to have a gun\nIs one of about ... thirty or forty the border that she's not going to win Ohio has done that but yet he won agree with President Trump to put a wall\nNow if you have an invasion coming in our country and you won't stop on the wall how are we supposed to stop him other than putting either troops on the water or ice having guns to protect ourselves\nIt's absolutely comment on that let me comment on that day I hadn't heard I hadn't heard and heard about the gun I had heard about the of Ryan has said that\nWe need to have border security but I don't want to wall well I don't know if that means that you're going to go out here in either put troops on the border or have drones or some kind of security out here he does not want a wall especially what he's saying is you are going to make it\nOut you're going to put humans out there that have to make a decision on other humans coming across if in fact you have this wall\nThat you can't scale it can't can't a Ford well the fact of it is is that you don't have to put the put us in that position right the wall will do the trick\nIs exactly right yeah thank you David appreciate it thank you very much my Seventy W Kagan\nI suppose you can come out here and say you know what is the guy that had the best idea years ago and I I don't know if he's considered a pariah or what\nBut Pat Buchanan I have always admired his writing I've always admired the brain of Pat Buchanan eroded ... wrote a book and you've heard me talk about ... years and years ago I think it's still in my library at the station\nAnd he basically said what you need is in certain areas you need\nA four lane highway where the where the national guard or the border\nPatrol can run up and down that and watch this and patrol this area so that they can move back and forth in these areas that you know these everywhere you don't need to go over the mountains there's not many people going over mountains to get in here\nAll right I'm not a call let's go to five Seventy W gave you a good morning you are on the air welcome to the show [noise]\nYeah [noise] this whole thing is I don't think there's an easy answer I think I liked the idea of a road\nMore than a wall I mean how well did that magic no line help out the French in World War two [noise]\nNo I don't know I thought that it will be\nActually get into all the conservatives supposed to know something about history [noise]\nThey've out on a ... or you know the wall and Germany just blow it up at is what will happen\nThey'll just blow it up from the other side there's two sides to wall\nElevated thank you or your iPod your here well hang on a second I'll pick you up here in a minute but I got to take a break but I Want to come back to this and just make a comment put him on hold by can come back to the second\nBut remember in Germany they were keeping people in there we're not trying to keep people in the United states a waltz make very good very very they they work very well I've got one right\nYou've got walls around your house you know that's that's that's the way you do it All right let's take a break I'll pick back up and then submitted than he was making a point and ah I just took a break back in a minute on by Seventy WKBD in Denver's and that we're at Columbia Cadillac Buick\nAnd we hope you'll come down Chevrolet\nBack in a second like UPS\nIt's kind of I'm from ... did you get down the road\n[noise]\nMy hair\n\n[noise]\nRun from paying twenty seven partly cloudy fifty light wins tomorrow cloudy fifty three Saturday like rain forty seven Sunday forty eight [noise] in a nutshell folks the weekend looks pretty shaky but today and tomorrow look like they're okay thirty seven degrees [noise] okay\nNow here we um mess deck is up one thirty six and I looked at him and that's what the Dow was off four hundred that was from yesterday though\nSo [laughter] where the Dow is up to Nineteen today too so breathe a sigh of relief right there right [noise] uh I'm gonna ask James James seems like a pretty good color so I Want to if he can possibly stay on I'll give you a little bit more time here oh he's gone or well maybe he will maybe we'll call back\nBut that he was making a point about um\nWhether or not we have this magic ... lined up and up\nThe national line is biking I retire\nAnd he's a kind of an imaginary line here where the they put this fence up here and uh well it was this year I just wanted to say what it was it was they went around the ... it\nWasn't a fad stand it was a series of very well constructed in very big fortresses with a case mentioned cannons and they put it up along the French German border hoping of keeping the Germans out will in Nineteen forty the Germans simply went around the damn thing by invading neutral Belgium\nI get it you guys do deserve a race we can give you that raise but there's going to have to be fewer of you were going to have to lay some people off to give other people races and those people will hopefully be able to go find another job maybe it'll be out of state but they got to go you know we go back to take the seniority and these people got to go and so we can give you a raise\nIn my ... ... ... it just doesn't work that way I mean what if you talk to your guns what is your Jennifer a injuries that occurred you said this is the way it is one of the union got to do about that [laughter]\nAnd I'm not being smog and smart I'm just I I really I'm not I'm just saying these situations have pragmatic answers right now the pragmatic answer is that the tax payers in\nPoland in boardman in Austin talented limited warranted you name the community they're not in the mood\nTo give more money to schools at least they haven't shown that propensity to do some\nWork with what you've got you've got to eliminate some programs\nLemonade bussing that's what we always do that's not really where the money is stopped doing that crap and let's talk about where the money is the money's just like Social Security Medicare that's the lion's share of the budget that would cut off foreign aid to El Salvador to get to make much difference\nSame thing with schools you've got to cut salaries and that means teachers that means teachers assistance delivered that message Jennifer ...\n\nIs editor shoveling deliver that message you guys can have a raise it's no problem\nWe just got to go back and feel ... find out how many we have to lay off to give you your demands\nRight\nThey believe I I'm not being a smart alec I'm really not just saying that that's kinda where we are right now and I think that's where a lot of the audiences\nAnyway let's see what folks have to say five Seventy WKBD and um we're just a slight little delays so if I'm not real quick on the uptake us because we have to lay down here at the cellular phones it can be a little difficult here is our next call we're just doing a wild card you're good morning you are on five Seventy WPN and welcome to our program\nI good morning as Don from said I'm done I'm how you doing today [laughter] done anyway wonderful and the what's your point anyway I I think this whole thing is going to be shut up to be a disaster for President Trump\nI listened to some of the other rock cash or some of the international news I don't hear any Democrat can damning this wave of people coming up here [noise] ah they're blaming Trump for all the reasons why they're coming here\nAh and ah they're just sitting back and waiting now they're blaming it all the pipe bombs on Trump and they're going to wait and see what happens ah and make him want him to make a bad mood when these people get to the border and underground and start pointing fingers\nAt it now because none of them are having a solution on how we can move forward and prevent this from happening and we need to stop this happening 'cause there are these people are successful this first wave of people there's going to be twenty five dollars or more of I'm struck the next one\nAnd are going to try to do the same thing so it has to be stopped somehow and uh I I pray to God to President Trump can figure it out and uh we got to put sheets this we can't do crash by our border ah with all these people shouldn't happen\nThat get on the ... here's my here's my here's my observation don't vote for one Democrat\nDon't vote for a Democrat the Democrats are going to make Donald Trump's life a living hell if they get the Congress any gains that we have made we're going to go right back to the old standoff where you're getting nothing done\nWhat good is our government have you back or do you tip the Congress to the Dems they are going they're never going to vote for anything that Donald Trump they hate him\nThey hate the fact that the stock market has gone up they hate the fact that America has seemingly is doing better and if they don't stop drop right now they could lose the White House for the next eight years because they pretty sure that Donald Trump is going to win again\nSo you got it in your hands do again being pragmatic what's the point in putting another Democrat back they're just not going to help you folks I got to help you a guarantee you you're going to have the worst country if you have Chuck Schumer\nAnd Nancy Pelosi and Tim Ryan leading your country let's continue by Seventy WKBD good morning you are on the air hello\nHello Adam from Poland I'm Adam how you doing\nGood and the lady biking and I agree with me on that and then we'll\nAtmosphere and the country at the moment or actually having gone on over the last couple of days and days and the poor way\nBut we'll get to the border and being done by the national guard and the federal government would go over in the national guard had and loop through Penn State against the governor will last time we had in the ... in this country that we can go over very well

inflated for the amount of kids that you are serving\nYou know I I don't know if there's other schools that have that same trend but that one has been one of them's than in the spotlight so much in that the projections are that they are going to have about two hundred kids less than the than the pipeline than they used to have so you get fewer kids going there\nUm I don't know have you ever tried that\nYou know my\nKind of how I live by my rule of pragmatism as basically hey here's what it is folks you want this where you can have this\nI I just think that that works you go out there and

name given that the interpretation of the Nineteen Ninety five ... vision of the application of the Cuban adjustment act\nThat goes back to Nineteen sixty six essentially and that essentially says that anyone who fled Cuba and entered the United states would be allowed to pursue residency here [noise] [noise]\nUm so I don't think that what we're dealing with right now\nHas any relationship to the change in this ... feet dry feet policy I think any country if you come to the United states and asked for asylum we're going to give you a hearing if your pursuit if you are failure persecuted\nWe give you a hearing now that doesn't mean you're going to get in because you're going to have to you're going to prove\nThat you are under the threat of punishment or death if your return to the country\nIf somebody has a veterans reputation of that a ... that's my best shot at it that's that's what I'm thinking I could be a little bit wrong let's continue now and we'll go to our next call wildcard style and good morning and welcome you're on vice Seventy WKBD hello\nHi Dan said that Adam\nSmith Yes sir\nYeah that I I think I got a it might help you out somewhat on this problem I think the first\nThing the president will probably do is you'll probably call a special cabinet meeting\nAnd get it all his cabinet secretaries forgiving with the secretary of state and the homeland security and the fats and all I give him a report on the on what state are very well not be able to handle\nAnd and basically you know it'll give him the the bassist they're going declare a national emergency because of a clear and present danger that just ... would present\nThat present a health problem to a country to certain general probably give them a report that just a what a cause a a real proud of general health of the nation\nAnd are they a national security in general order it probably tell the secretary of treasury just stopped some farms going to Mexico or Guatemala or whether they're wiring back their money uh there's all types of avenues ripped a and that requires call up the military and\nAnd this is spent on the books\nCan take a concerning uh asylum of all the other uh immigration wind direction it it'd be a national emergency and then there's something I wanted to follow and injunction against this law that have probably no basis because he has all the ducks in a row to support a national emergency\nUh what do you have to go through Congress in your estimation now he knows and all that are\nAlready has the power by the constitution national emergencies that he's and that's part of his dirty Congress doesn't play it on a national emergency Congress starting to come into play\nExcellent so that's a very good interpretation so what you're saying is that you go back and you make your best case in your cabinet members make the same case back to you and then when you have that interpret you you're you're interpreting this is a national emergency you could deploy troops as necessary\n... whatever the national security ... or ... he has a standard or a they have to have a clear and present danger to the nation\nAnd that's a very ... that just rush invasion is\nPresenting a clear and present danger and they're not time just to take Fifteen of ten Fifteen thousand yeah asylum in a ... or ... or not even telling us where they're coming from\nOr where they're going they're they're not just going to come knock on the front door and say we're coming in there all along the border wherever they feel that they can intrude\nYeah yeah and there is no dark invasion yeah they're running on a rug ... from Kurt forward and and\nUh I don't believe any job just got to stand up to a national emergency\nReal well thanks for helping me out there I appreciate that sir thank you very much five Seventy WPN and um we're talking about uh what does the president do when you have these people coming down here would have been a little
