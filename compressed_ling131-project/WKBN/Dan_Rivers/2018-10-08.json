the advantage historically going back while she was the last ten years out of your work later\nAh that's that's the the caliber of the style that we used to and those are like what's happening now with coach ... it's just it's hard to watch but you saw elements come together there there were one or two titans on most places in the last ...\nDrives for the eight points and the drive for you or I I really feel dam that may be that our sensors getting that I wanted a\nBoy you know you don't have to ... throwing the ball that you know\nYou know and as I remember watching those eight points that were scored and I was saying to everybody that I was running the deal what we're down here let's just muscle that ball in here nothing fancy no sweeps no you know a no passes here and we went and mental mental and we got the ball in the end zone\nYeah you know if you are listening to the call it but I I was most excited person on the order of because for two weeks in a row I saw some of the

look at it you know we got a nice all vented wind that you've got the one of the premier running banks here and if you don't make it that's the way it goes but a strap it up and go in and then they come back and get the two points on it or the yeah the two points on the past I Believe\nAnd uh you know certain look pretty dog going good and then we had to hold on\nYeah the nice thing is we have

actually like North Dakota state better than south of the state so I I think coach ... and the coaching staff I Know what to do\nI think our kids mentally or in a good place really it's a tough place to play games or is it is a tough place to go that love their football if they're in South Dakota North Dakota but uh\nI I I feel confident there's still the top of the he yeah I mean from our

goes without saying yesterday I mean Saturday was pivotal living to get the team could have gone one way or another\nAnd uh you know it just turned on that field goal but that that when it really was

radio five Seventy some caveats young [noise]\n\nSherry Preston family members of the twenty people killed in a limo crash in upstate New York are asking the same thing as investigators this morning why it's ABC's ...\nThen then how do we corroborate any of this how do we get that information without trying to go through some criminal prosecution on some level so now I Do think that these stories are going to continue to come out and you're going to see deeper elements of that and we know now the Democrats are trying to push for even though\nAnd frankly this with them before even Susan Collins speech but they were pushing for impeachment on some level for judge Kavanaugh here and that's I mean they want to do but I think that's\nStarting to lose interest in their base and I think as we're here for weeks out now\nFrom what's going to be the mid term elections they can't jeopardize too much here to try to do what they can to to throw cabinet off or get him removed one and and frankly they should be focusing on the midterms and doing something else\nYou know a Michael Bowers was a tremendously radio news what is the dean of ... about capital\nWell it's funny because that moment that Susan Collins said that she saw Kavanaugh and and and she can she was convinced by him on his passion for what he did and and that he wanted to defend his name that's the same moment that other people are saying they have great concerns about judge Kavanaugh's decision making abilities and this former dean of Yale\nLaw school the one that the Kavanaugh was under when he was going to school at Yale said he calls this an American tragedy to confirmation as an American tragedy going on to say that the new Supreme Court justice is a black robe embodiment of Rob partisan power\nWhich he believes is inconsistent with any ideal of an impartial judiciary so this is the guy who said that with that part is an anger hunting reminder\nBehind the smiling face of judicial benevolence lies the force of an urgent will to power this\nIn his mind Zion not somebody who's willing to sit back and kind of listen to all sides of a story and cast judgment then\nThis is somebody who is going in with an agenda and that's where his concerns seems to be now with that\nChief justice John Roberts already has received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints in recent weeks against Kavanaugh and most of those centering on the statements cabin all made during his Senate confirmation hearing that seems to be the sticking point when you call out Democrats when you call up at Clinton's\nThat seems to be something that is going to be above it's going to stick around for a while\nRight now Michael as I listen to this size up what has happened no obviously you have no way of really telling you have a lot of people are understanding the same thing I Am but people are now saying you know what after this the Democrats have really stepped on it\nAnd we are now looking at um maybe a red wave coming up here it will will will know probably about a month from right now\nThat's what we're going to know for sure and I think that there's a lot of that that's fair I think I think that there are ways to misrepresent that though too I Do\nThink that there is a fired up Republican base that that's outside of the normal basis I think you're seeing some fired up Republicans that are looking at what the Democrats have done since the early days and it was just a few weeks ago frankly but the early days of this Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing where they were interrupting and you had the protesters and I think that's adding a certain element all the way up to the swearing in\nThe Republicans are in very much and supportive\nAnd I think for the Democratic side they're hoping that if there's one thing that can get millennials out to vote forget they're based part they can get these millennials who are very rarely going out to vote and get them to the polls and try to win and those numbers it's something as simple as one message that you can put into a tweet\nOr a hash tag or put on Instagram that might get them to the polls and they're hoping that this is going to be at that and me too movement\nAnd an element of what cabin I wasn't clear on is what they're hoping to get that and frankly honestly we could end up seeing both of those happen you could very well end up seeing both parties\nHave a record number turn out to the polls coming up here in a month um we've yet to see how that's going to work out\nWherever the Ohio governor debate tonight our last one that will be between the wine and Cordray and that's at seven debate\nAnd uh we're moving ever so closer to deciding whether or not we're going to have a red wave or a blue wave or maybe maybe just a hurricane or else we do have a hurricane or me down in the Gulf right now Michael anything else this morning\nI think are just just keep watching out that they've got President Trump who is holding the ceremonial swearing in for cap and all the White House tonight again that the ceremonial party was officially sworn in on Saturday but then cabinet takes his seat tomorrow and guess what some of the cases he's facing include a imposing lengthy prison sentences on firearms offenders who have three prior violent felony corrections\nAnd another one that's asking the court to consider which illegal immigrants can be detained during deportation hearings he's jumping right in both feet to the fire here\nMichael by our NBC Radio news by the way we've got a ... Ohio again today he's going to be down near the Cincinnati area so he's a he is definitely on the ...\nHe must definitely as he's getting out as much as he possibly can which is what he indicated he would do and you will do over the next\nYeah thank you Michael have a great day you've got to enjoy your morning thank you Michael by our NBC\nRadio news ... five Seventy WKBD and and uh it is the Dan River is program\nOh All right nice to have you and uh I guess one of the things that um I think about over the weekend is that um people still\nAre having the hangover from Brett Kavanaugh being elected but all of the people I think are glad to see this go and here's the thing Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed fifty the forty eight over the weekend\nKavanaugh's approval followed a confirmation pure process that went on and on and it had the ups and downs I guess for one for one moment I was happy\nTo see Brett Kavanaugh with his hand on the Bible\nIs wipe holding the Bible his children watching and I'm just thinking of what they have gone through that is just more than one family really deserves I'll\nGive you some reflections in just a moment this is five Seventy W caveat\nOne thousand dollars now\nFeel that the one or two hundred you'll get a tank confirming injury plus I hard radio in\nThe great supplying bills to two hundred two hundred five Monday\nOctober eighth what's new today on the free I her radio last October\nFor decorating the house for just setting the burying our mighty platelets tracks with labor in mind when no after your day\nPlaying make sure you break out all our great tailgate party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium and new high heart radio free for all its collections that come out now\nHave to listen to them they're [noise] you know there has to be something there but it it's hard for me it just didn't nothing or on one thing and say you know this is what I'm looking for in a song\nBecause I don't know exactly what it is when it strikes me you know it's just you know it's just there and I know that I Want to go in the studio and now I Want to\nIt's called Sandy's auto body you're going to find them at forty three or four young selling polling road there next to Taco Bell they'd give you the phone number if you want to call them this morning seven five five Seventy eight Seventy eight seven five five Seventy eight Seventy eight and continue to read reviews how people are so very happy with the fact that\nChuck Philbrick keeps you abreast how you're going all hosts things are going along with pictures and calls and lets you know when it's going to be completed does a great job does a great job said he thought about taking my work there to manufacturers guarantee on parts lifetime guarantee\nOn their work say at these\nAuto body part our phone numbers are seven to nine nine nine seven seven seven to nine nine nine seven seven and if you think about it the folks this is a good news maybe we can finally turned the page and move on to some things that are important even some local issues would met me night\nWe'll start with Jim in Poland he wants to talk about the Kavanaugh issue\nAnd I want to give you a reflection of some of the pundits to on what they have said but we're going to do that right after we update the news on news radio five Seventy WKBD in where the tribe plays today are pre game is that one of six today do or die for the tribe will have it for you [noise]\nKeep listening to my heart radio for more from Nineteen sixty eight coming um [noise]\nThis is the Dan River show on news radio five Seventy W.

step their game up because um you know if you want to be on the same footing as women women do not want a free loader\nRight and they want someone that's going to help them pull the card right and this is changing and I think a lot of women are saying hey you know what I'm not married because I Can't find anybody on the same page with me\nBut those positions that we're talking about you are one by merit not by what six sure what race you are\nWell you know your mother profiled this morning I mean that's I mean\nThe thing is that seems to me the past couple of years a white males especially are under attack by this country that's all I point out when I got my\nI got it to my thank you very much for making it I made the point earlier kind of in jest but will we be looking at this a few years from now and we're going to find out that most of the women most of the people that are making decisions are women in the Senate\nAnd they've been around for a while and now they have gray hair

hair a little bit dark I don't know only has a hairdresser would no\nBut you look at a lot of other guys out there like Patrick Leahy and John McCain and all white haired old men and a paper looking like that's a bad thing you know what folks it's um it's not it's not radicalism in our country that has served the day what it is is really folks\nLetting the evolution pay it play out because we have\nPretty good constitution I mean it's it's may not be perfect and the diesel tweaking from now and then but it's hard to tweak it really is up but let me get office for a little bit here and what I Want to just reflect a little bit\nAnd you just mentioned Youngstown State university and um you know I have to reflect on re buyers door for and I had heard that ray was um you had a heart attack and ah he has now died he taught geology at Youngstown State university\nAnd re had been on my program by phone a couple of times and in person once\nAnd I'm just a bright guy that really believed in the causes and you know he and I could not have disagreed more on fracking but he was he came from a scholarly viewpoint he worked for Gulf Oil for a while he knew\nAbout a gaining a you know these large corporations paid him\nAbove for geology inside\nBut he came to be known as the guy that won radical change in ...\nHe supported the community rights bill never got it through but he and his wife Suzie\nThey believe fervently and what they're doing and I think Suzie still does and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and his twin daughters and the doctor re has passed on all too young died of a heart attack and they saluted him but Moshe role\nOn friday night but a doctor raised by her doctor re by her store for very articulate man for his cause and you know an another guy that you know\nCould talk to him and I could he was not offended by ... by a um stance that I Would take\nBut he was an environmental activist and a leader of a group pushing to ban fracking in Youngstown you didn't get it done and I think he was on the wrong side but uh boy I tell you what he could bring his side of the viewpoint\nAnd it's just so sad to see a guy would that much intelligence that has a gun\nTo his reward and again our thoughts to Dr raised twin daughters\nAnd his wife Suzie it's going to be hard soldier on without him I Know but my thoughts are with you [noise] All right we lose people and uh again you go back and to think about cheese just terrible terrible we lose somebody so young\nAnd what have they done\nThey said well we're going to take off teaching for a while we're ever travel around the world\nIn other words she's kind of you rewarded right\nWasn't she really rewarded for what she did at Georgetown\n\nThe television station and you know they have their rights to do this but once George to the television station quote he violated our policy so he's no longer with us\nWe don't allow people to wear a campaign clothing while on assignment\n\nDon't you wish others will step up like this you know the the guys would do for ...\nYou're going out here and you're going to wear your ... you know\nIt'd be one thing for me to do it and then you you know I've supported Donald Trump and it's a commentary show\nBut this guy goes out and does this make ... wearing an American ... wearing a make America great again hat and he gets booted\nStarted even though what about George too much about George them by we should take some more calls and we\nWill this is the rivers good morning [noise]\n\nOr take a look at what's happening

the black man is not in the not in the families and you know what you cannot big wide sweeping statements about\nThings anymore you have to realize like you just pointed out it's all about individuals is that people are going to [noise] do weird and good things\nAbsolutely and you can generalize old people based on one person you know it seems like a lot of our laws are based on you know a couple

... she's read she is so well read but I just can't believe\nThat women can't make it on their own now this is not the days of Harriet Tubman this is not the days of awe suffered him yeah and she's always talking about surfer she's ... she refers to suffer just so much doesn't she\nWell you know like the thing is I Can't really read the book I haven't read the book yet but the thing is yeah I
