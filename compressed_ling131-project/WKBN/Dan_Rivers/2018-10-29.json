I think it's at a point where people are becoming disinterested and the you know I think the troops have to get together and kind of figure it out\nYeah you know these kids are playing for a scholarship and someone had written the other day that if you really wanted to play ball you might give you just go in there for the school you might go to school like Iraq or something I saw one of those comments this is a real commitment to be in division one foot\nBall it is down the road boy I mean the the amount of time these coaches and kids put an especially on kids going to class I mean it's unbelievable and it's it's it's\nA year round commitment that there are times during the year where it's dark but you know the commitment is kind of their you know three hundred and sixty five days a year and you're still ... you know when you go to North Dakota state and ... and don't have class on friday you have to juggle\nYou know not having a class on friday or getting the notes from that class on friday or taking a test differently and then you're lifting weights earlier in the morning it's a it's a commitment I mean it's it's a two job commitment for four or five years for these kids it's a\nTough one you you you went through it and you know your your your major in Michigan and uh you know neither did I\nWas I was a pharmacist pharmacy major for farm the major and\nMy junior year Beauchamp Becker called man because he would always get us tutors or whatever we needed there was a farm de ... a lab Monday Wednesday and friday from four to seven in the fall so you could imagine how that went and he brought me in his office and said you know as much as I tried to get a tutor for you I think you're changing your major so\nYeah yeah it was it yeah he's right I mean my son told me the same thing you know it's not easy to get great grays and play football but in any case we'd soldier on and it's a I'm a young says the team that you can probably relate to the same line that was to be one of our strength this year what do you see are they not playing together or of what is going on there\nWell you have kind of a death by a thousand cuts you know the talent as their\nButt talent is kind of a fifty percent on any level whether you're watching girls volleyball at Carnegie Mellon or Youngstown State or the Packers and the rams the mental side of sports is alive and well and uh the physical side as there but for whatever reason\nAh there's mistakes being made I think there may be not from an offensive line standpoint you know then I I I'd love to have a tight and next to me as I had most of the time with both ... back or I'd like to see a full back you know the times are changing but\nAs an offensive line historically Youngstown State has never done well as Michigan is not done well I'm thirty nine thirty twelve and when you get a couple of completion so that's where your sets I I I I think the ... you know the crazy thing with this is the talent is there\nYou know you've had a couple of injuries defensively but I mean come on you have a painting award finalist as you're running back you have three or four titans are transfers at our studs um have you know some wide receivers that have stepped up so I think somewhere in there the culture of this team\nLast couple of years is falling apart whether\nIt's bringing you know it's it's whether it's the junior college kind of scenario where\nYou know somebody's working their butt off two three years and you bring in a Jew co great kid that take that person spot for a year\nWhether it's a fifth year person coming I I don't know but the culture of that team you know you see them come out and go down the field and scored a touchdown and you look like they're going to score a hundred points on Indiana State and then you don't see that fire the rest of the game something's up so\nYeah you got it in the boat has been talking about all along here especially at the beginning of the season is and you know we're trying to get the culture to where I wanted and he apparently has read the locker room indirectly\nYes and that he he was he was very up on this team but you know then doesn't have to you don't have to go much further than the first game I mean we we played a very poor butler team if you take a look at where butler is this year they're not very good it wasn't like\nWild Butler's really improve no we played a bad butler team that does\nNot have scholarships and our kids mentally did not show up that day\nAnd it's really the whole season's been like a microcosm of the butler game I mean you you want to like write that off like boy they were looking at West Virginia and it's a great team but really that that was the team I mean mentally they did not show up that day\nMentally they didn't do the things the coaches put them in a position to do and that that's kind of a microcosm\nOf it is in a second year we did get it done though I mean you know we both went to the championship game and we're out there watching the penguins and they performed well although they were beaten by um she does matter matters yeah but you know we we played but that team was a very good team and so I mean the culture was okay then yeah\nThen you take a look at it and even the last year in North Dakota state of Maine huge huge program I mean last year physically we had a beep at the ice castle and ah but for some some quarterback injuries and in some things that have happened we end up losing that over time\nIt's not a physical nature my bowl and I have talked I mean the physical kids are out there he he he's not using it as an excuse that he lost a couple of safe these kids stepped up and you see that at times you and I watched most plays this year you see at times where they could do it\nAnd then you see times were defensively\nTackles her midst and defensively there's ten yards between a defensive back in the receiver\nSo you see these mental breakdowns and you just you know as a team ... sometimes it's leadership sometimes it's it's just the culture of the team when you when you hear president trust will talk about some of the great Ohio State in Youngstown State teams as you know the culture of a team even if you have all the kids back\nIt's still a team game and each team has their own psychological\nMakeup and uh one doesn't have a new\nFriend the bows and where do you see his head I mean as far as a continuing to try to build this program you're young says they hide\nThat he's the most passionate person in that building you know I have the\nGood graces of uh and and I love them as a friend and I respect them as one of the great defensive minds that's out there and respect his record as a head coach but uh he's as passionate as everything or his daughter is a carton of money right now he and his wife ... loving Youngstown\nAnd a ... there's been nothing that's been done to me that doesn't show has continued commitment to uh to Youngstown State this contract is up or and sure there'll be having conversations but ah he loves Youngstown and that and there's nobody in Youngstown Dan much as you love it and I love it\nHe he he he wants to see the penguins succeed and you see 'em in the ... and the enough or Monday a radio shows him to see him on the planes and there's nobody more passionate he's putting more time and then ever trying to figure this out and\nYou know I I think he's going to\nEnd up playing some younger kids that that might have some passion so it's going to be an interesting couple of weeks especially flying out the Fargo North Dakota this week but uh he he he loves why issue and everything else down and\nYou know he'll be success you want to build those I Hope he hangs around longer you making the trip this weekend I Am you miss the Michigan games as your image it I have but that's that's okay I had\nA had a chance to go back and see a game that by week and then I uh I uh was a part of a group of a line when the south Dakota so I missed that game but uh I made a commitment to help out and uh I Love Youngstown State has a lot of people on the air do and\nUh it it's

them so we have we have some football going on in this area and it is an important thing if you think about this because I'm\nIn my opinion we have always been the struggling small city in Ohio\nAnd I always thought if we had gotten into the Mac it would put us on par with places like Toledo in Akron and uh you know ... and you know\nYou think about the the bigger cities they have these Mac teams and we were shut out of that and that didn't get involved in it but we had that prowess in one double a football we went to a national championship but never never forget when you're going to a national championship\nUnless you're playing it and most people forget about it and they don't know about it they do know about the Mac teams in the Mac teams are getting into more bowls right now and I think that was a critical mistake or the bus ... will not maybe kept thing in Akron makes it was a good thing because\nApparently they're the ones that kept us out of the back but that was a time when we last getting into the Mac I thought that was a turning point in the building of Youngstown State football and then you had you know the nine years of coach hey caulk and only making the playoffs once and now we have fallen about as low as I can remember\nAnd she's just on the just a few years ago four years ago I mean you saw letters to the editor you saw people talking about we've got coach ... coming to Youngstown we're going to bring in both ... mental why we thought we were on the upswing but it didn't work out that way\nThoughts on it love to hear what you have to say ah let's start with a north Lima ed here's a good morning on five Seventy W ... how are you sir\nI'm good this morning we'll let 'em good yeah ... yeah\nI I my philosophy has always been given the coach three years if nothing happens get rid of them and you have to look back you know you keep saying Hancock only had one uh you know one plant where he went to the playoffs but\nThe second year of ... time at why issue most of those players were from Hancock\nOkay they cut off because the clock yeah hey Koch were\nFrom Haiti cock you mean Perot you being from a wolf or you know\nIt will yeah war for making a gimmick Wolford [laughter]\nSo they they most of those players who are still his recruits guy and\nThe other thing is it started it starts from the top down when ... is our coach\nI could watch the program we trust so and there was communications and back and forth between the community community he\nI mean there are a lotta times he didn't say a lot\nBut he came across the way he was saying some stuff building up the enthusiasm about coming out we haven't had a coach like that since he left and he did the same thing out of state I mean he rallied Ohio State when he got there because they weren't you know they were just so so when he got to Ohio State\nAnd he rally to support the community\nAnd that's where we don't have any ... and we haven't had an aide coaches and then your comment about local talent yes I agree with you but we now have a top grade University in a sense of we have dormitories we have we have a health center coming we have all kinds of stuff we do need to go outside the area\nIf you look at those Dakotas they have kids from outside of those areas come into play\nYeah I mean at the all the things you said are interesting because um I but I think it would be easier to get somebody to come to a young stone rather than going to North Dakota I mean just think about visiting North Dakota hard it would even to be able to fly into into Fargo\nOh I I agree there's no question about it and we should and and we should be able to recoup recruit those kids that are going there okay and and you know it's like it's the old saying if you have a a ... a football player\nWho have a rating in Youngstown and an eight plus football player from Miami or Florida or Oklahoma\nYou would take the eight plus guy eats try to sell them like crazy and we don't see that happening in my opinion\nAnd some of the players we have at Youngstown State and from the recruiting side of the stroller that has to he's been there long enough what has he done not only in the in the uh football arena but look at the other ones the basketball and all those\nI mean I think they were a little bit too quick to pull the trigger on a wall for because you know here's here's the thing about the you know offered was a colorful guy that was out in the community and right and you know what I'm if you are somebody that's ten and then you can have both persona and that and not be out in the community that much\nBut if you're not you you got to you you got to be loved rice and that that's the other thing I mean we're we're here we're losing in ... not available to most of the media\nJust ban just look at the difference okay look at that you know and he's not and I I was and all that thrilled about trust so coming here okay as as as president but look at what he's done\nIf you go back at you know invite him to get the numbers are the fund raisers that he's performance when he got here I think it was three hundred something okay\nAnd he is driven every year he's been here the fundraising for the university has gone up tremendously\nWhat what's the word ... what do you mean by the word by three hundred\nThree hundred million three hundred million dollars and that's how much less about\nThree hundred thousand but it's over a million now\nYeah well I mean he has gotten a lot of contributions that of course it's a just an amazing thing and I ... he he but he he's a great communicator and and I do think that Jim ... if given enough time will right the ship but to me a little bit tired of waiting to tell you the truth because I was waiting thing\nHe took on year contract\nYeah but I I remember a cock you know the thing about ... you know Mr he caught he is a wonderful man and a great coach but in and he always are so close because we're winning eight nine games and then still not getting in and he had he had some real bad luck but he got things going pretty good here and then I thought that do offer came in came very close\nRight yeah and then and there was that go with the issues that go by the former attorney general you're you're not supposed to be a Scully bags at the bottom of the\nWell that's what I'm going to be fighting today people are

two degrees of news radio five Seventy WKBD in October twenty ninth here and a Halloween coming up and that we spend a little bit of time talking\nAbout why issue football and I think it's just part of I'm loving this valley you don't you you know the part of seeing this valley in a different\nLight it's a resurgence of the valley because you know we had some doggone many years when things were falling down around us and we were bleeding jobs and people were losing\nUh interested in the valley and you see that I can hear that his Youngstown State university and you say hey man that that kind of glue says altogether you know from a\nFrom Columbia anti war into Youngstown we can all agree at Youngstown State University He's a great place to go many of us attended Youngstown State if not graduated my producer did I did and uh we remember those days when we can be proud and people would say hey the penguins they're known all over the state than Jim trust all made\nA big mark here and then went on to Ohio State I don't know if the states can return or not but I'm hopeful that they can but this has been one disappointing football season so let's see we got football calls here in the Vince you'll be next but then first Nick hello\nNick good morning the morning it was you know calling and I moved from Pittsburgh from being I'm twenty five years ago or so okay and uh you know\nVery proud of you know say a mile from Youngstown is correct me if I'm Out here 'cause this is what I've heard about but let me let me see if you\nAre fires fishes all troops first off he goes to the moon he said oh what is your state then he gets into coaching ended up winning the super bowl ring with the niners energy coordinator ends up winning the national championship\nWhich are less years at the coordinator goes out and do crafts guy wins nine or ten games or season they fire for some political reasons\nThey stole a ton of money so he decides to come back to his home town to help out in his home town of his kid gives kids the chance to graduate from his alma mater and I'll bring his wife back home blah blah blah blah blah because he he doesn't need to go get another big job\nBecause Nebraska is already guarantee him a certain amount of money\nSo you guys there she comes back to the national championship in two years I've been a year so far this year and people from his home town\nWhere he came back or getting on the joke I can understand if he was from somewhere else and how people are quick to jump on and off bandwagon but when it does live she\nCame back home and it's doing what he's doing he's also helping out a lot of other coaches as you noted his brother left\nTo go on to greener pastures defensive coordinator left to go on to greener pastures so we're building up a coaching tree hearing young child as well so these authors of coordinators defensive coordinator whoever these new coaches are that are on to the next step in their life\nHopefully they grow branch out and go become you know bigger better colleges when the national championship and have a great\nCoaching life for themselves but I mean to just jump off his bandwagon actress haters I Can't believe it whatever [noise] also I think what you're talking about that that the loans is up there they need the cash them out and put patios out there so that you can bring some electrician each of the team\nThey get no motion on on the team for Saturday ... that really hurt him to the quick I think hit but his\nCoaching credentials and hate cutting motivate the kids yeah maybe at a step back and look and say hey maybe we missed on some of the kids we we should have that the other guy maybe we should it took a recruit closer to home that's going to play for the pet and when the instead of going way down\nThe well you know with ... with a passion that the guy had used before you know the guy that had called earlier and he was talking about a boat is a fantastic coach and uh you know he you know he went to a national championship a defensive specialist and you know\nYou had a good record in Nebraska but you come back to this you also have to come back and say okay\nHere's this program making incremental\nImprovement because you've got a lot of money invested here right this is you know you got the you don't put in these watch training centers and tried to upgrade your university to have nobody coming there because you know I'm thinking about we're always different than Akron right because Akron would they had a signature when this year they won over a Big Ten teams\nBut they still don't draw the way that you would have ... or ... can't\nI mean yeah they they should the wagon wheel game that they're big game at Grand cat and there was less than five thousand people there and that's their big game yup enemy remember down we used to go up to ... and coached\nA President Trump was the coach and they used to play that for the ... cup and it would be Ken Akron and asked him why she would travel either to counteract that no one year that can't pass out there that are scheduled cards the stance for full and if you looked on the color brochure it was full of people are wearing\nRed and white you know yeah I mean I I Wonder I Wonder if we had gone into the Mac ... thing here we have we wouldn't have gotten the map\nBut what we have done would we be the bottom of the macro I don't know when it's a tough teams out there you think about what western Michigan did a few years ago um that could be coming our way but anyway this I have to go because there's other calls you're the one to speak and here is George from Poland hello George welcome to the show\nHow you doing you know George what do you think it\nStill behind only any but a couple of things I think this is the ... year isn't it\nNo this is his fourth year with one mere one more year on the contract\nOkay this is your first year he didn't make the playoffs the second year he went to the national championship\nWhy shouldn't we didn't ... last year we did not make the playoffs\nLast year were home this year oh okay so you know everyone's safety brake coach you know I Do believe that but with but with the college game you have to also be a great recruiter mhm and then the purest right now that he's not ... well\nA or you know the players that play for him or however you wanted to spot in right\nWay I look at when you hire coach you got to give him for five years you know all his players CNN to see if you're better off for five years\nNow you know uh you know after that then you work at the beginning you know employees had a chicken for like the only thing I'd say right now is both solution when his players she could coach great which I Believe what he was coach in eighty percent of the previous coaches players when the\nSecond year and I have to say that you know we had the luck of the draw in the playoff run to we got better all along and we had a very very lucky past that we caught in the end zone there was a lot of things that went our way to get us in the national champions\nBut even if but if you take you know it it makes the national ... made the playoffs which is good she's his team's did things that if you remember to trust all every week they got better and better and better and that you expect out of your team and\nThat I haven't seen pit bottom bottom line are you glad ...\nWell I'm going to say yeah what I said yes we got a coach of both ... level and which still can't be competitive\nNow now that you know a division one late level what what are we going to do\nMean I I I agree I don't think there's another chapter again it's a recruiting ... is probably sixty Seventy percent of the battle\nYeah and this is not such a bad place to this is not going to North Dakota you got a really sell that program to get a kid to go to North Dakota where their parents are never going to see them play I got a ... will take Josh what's called

way of shoe fan are you [noise]\nOh [noise] then I used to go watch a\nDose ignoring and a ... at the stadium when I was in grade ... vt which there yeah and I thought oh man\nWell that's what I Do oh that's one thing we talk about we talk about it because we love it and\nI Want everybody to be proud of Youngstown State football but you have to win and uh what do you feel about the certain the current circumstances what your opinion\nWell you know Dan here's the thing I review personnel and it's all about people and there was some sort of a teamwork problem between the two uh they need or spearhead I don't know there are individual person is that spirit has that team you know a lot of times it's a quarter back\nA lot of times it could be a center in my day it was our center\nUh Larry Gates who was a tremendous never made a mistake fantastic center but you know if they had a guy like Mark way there why are you are I think they'd roll over a they'd be on the way\nI heard they're looking to Fordham mo Disney which I\nI Believe he committed to Fordham\n[noise] you know I don't know I haven't heard anything I Hope not I thought I'd go to Michigan State personally\nI think they can afford them what I heard but maybe it can be convinced to go to Youngstown State but uh I don't know the you know a lot of it does start with a quarterback and that Indiana quarterback really played well uh\nOh absolutely and by no means was Nazi Germany the only anti Semitic regime and it was not the holy regime that persecuted ah the daylights out of the Jews this stuff ... dates back to um [noise]\nActually even a Roman times when the Romans and the Holy Roman empire first became um a thing for when the Romans first Christianized in other words\nThis and you really you have to do a lot of research into this 'cause it's very complex issue and it evolves over time but the basis of it is the concept that some silly idiot came up with that the Jews are ... because they killed Christ\nYeah here's the thing about it I mean if you're looking for a group that has pretty much non confrontational and the people that are fairly peaceful isn't the Jews\nWell here's the thing too you can't blame them sometimes for like for instance when people complain about how defensive and reactionary Israel can be can you blame them yeah\nAnd a lot of ways because I mean and it dates back to that and there's a lot of modern permutations of it and in the modern era\nI'm you hear a lot about uh eight which is basically a fake book that was called the protocols of The Elders of his eye on it's a totally be bunk thing but this thing first got published\nIn the night to late Nineteen century in Russia because the czar was or executing ... against the Jews in Russia at the time and they were trying to stir up anti Jewish\nSentiment right and and that's ... ... one of the modern the modern incarnation starts to come from that the Jews are supposedly they have all the power they have all the money they're behind the scenes manipulating this manipulating that owned the name of a of world conquest\nAnd um it was done for political aims in other words to say hey there's your there's your um uh what would you call it your um your scapegoat yeah what you learn different they talk funny they they they look don't look like us they don't talk like us they don't worship like a scapegoat there's a problem\n... yeah I mean and if you walk down and you see a an observant Jew with long hair uh in certain parts of New York city um and then you say yeah they they look different but most of the Jews looked like everybody else\nNow why are largely unless you're unless you're one of the very strict ... where you keep with the beard no locks and everything but\nThis stuff's still persist to this day now and in our modern times you add on top of that ah there's quite a bit of anti Semitism still existent among Christian European people there's also a lot of that among the radical Islamic jihad he's a lot of their whole principle as well [noise]\nThey Jews well you know you know and and it it's sad it's really sad that people still have to hate people because of their faith\nYeah just kind of funny I just bring up you know something personal that uh we were at a volleyball game there at Carnegie Mellon in that dumped forms avenue and that's right where the synagogue was\nAnd the people mostly elderly there there were a couple of fifty five year olds but most of the people were above eighty that were they're worshipping on Saturday morning\nAnd they find themselves the target of this\nBut I think you can just substitute the word Jew for anybody you can put Catholics you could put Christian you could put anybody in that group and it has happened to other groups yeah and and what we're what we're now looking at is\nNot so much of the Jews were targeted but you are looking but soft targets are everywhere in that's what America\nIs all about and I as much as I go back and I say we have got weapons everybody has one here in the United states\nIf you want one there are so many people that are getting them how could this ... how could this guy possibly get this obviously the background check is not nearly sufficient to allow someone in that frame of mind\nAnd as I said earlier you have this guy in Florida who was arrested\nAnd he has all kinds of billboards on the side of his truck lockup Hillary and all of these kinds of things do we need to get into testing the temperature I don't think there's that much time in the world to go back and test everybody because these are the people that are just forefront\nI've if I can say the pro Trump stickers weren't the problem on the suspect's vehicle what I had the problem with were the ones that had the crosshairs over Hillary and Obama\nThat should be a red flag yeah but there is that there's actually people that will ... you don't you don't have to look for the fans you simply looked for social media wouldn't you think that we apparently are not doing enough if you're a social media count has all of this stuff that we're able to uncover later and\nPeople that maybe that's maybe that's the good thing here people are so proud of the misdeeds that they're doing they publish it they put it out there yep you'll you'll look at the drug dealing and all of the kinds of things and uh they put out sexual abuse and all of this that they put it out there for people to see\nYou would think that we would just simply have to donate to dedicate more of our time to keeping an eye on a certain group of people and you can go back and say well we're spying on everybody\nOr maybe that's what we have to do to protect the society\nAnd keep in mind that when it comes to these social media networks are your First Amendment right does not apply because your First Amendment right as we often remind people\nGives you the right to complain about the government without the government stop on yet these ... these of social media networks are private companies and they do regularly pull offensive stuff or stuff that they think is tricky they're supposed to report it maybe they just need to be more damn ...\nI'm I'm going to start with this question right here and I'm doing this rhetorically because I have a gun owner I'm a member of the national Rifle Association I Believe that it is our right to own a gun\nBut if you are of the same mind to me I've got to get calls to they're going to say to me Well Dan your your stance\nOf everybody deserves to have a gun is going nowhere and it's getting a little tried and true and it's getting a little played because there's thousands of these deaths every year and we feel that we are starting to become prisoners in our own home how many people do you see you know\nLet's say I'm not going there I don't feel safe going there\nHow many of our school children that you put your you put your child on a bus and you're assuming that they are going to be in a school that has protected and we're finding now that our schools much of the money that is spent has to be spent on security that's totally different from a few years ago\nWhat has changed in our society to bring us to the point where one of the topics and one of the top budget lines\nIs security and we talk about things while this arm the teachers let's let's go ahead and and and play in this society this society means that you have to have locks on the doors you have to have escape routes\nYou can do that and you can do that and you can do that pretty soon you'll be broken security I've often said that junk\nOr you think do you think that a stronger look at backgrounds and I mean making it very difficult to obtain weapons is a start\nI think looking at backgrounds as a good idea or I I think\nWe have to tread very carefully obviously 'cause we don't want to encroach on the second amendment any more than we absolutely have to but at the same time uh I think our entire approach has always been\nThat we're looking for people for instance we don't want to have people who are mentally ill have a gun well\nFirst of all how do you determine that unless you have access to that you can go back to in the past that this person has done and then how do you prove that he's actually mentally ill maybe he just a bad person right and that's what I'm going after uh I I Want us to look at things when somebody pulls a bad act it's a bad act\nLet's call it what it is and let's start there at least the dialogue with you there instead of always thinking that well we got to keep a mentally ill people from having a gun\nHow do you determine that from a distance especially\nWell you know something their coach constantly runs through this conversation too is a people that are responsible gun owners and rarely do you ever tier one of these ... these acts to somebody who is in the n._r._a. or a responsible gun owner\nThese usually are people that are on the fringe of society so you don't need to really start with responsible people but how do we dig down and find out people like this guy here in Pittsburgh where do you start with that\nI don't know but uh that's exactly my point and and I and quite frankly we're in total agreement about that\nSo [laughter] I'm gonna let it go I guess that's all I got an a and I ... I thought to I'm\nA ... a year taking my call thank you my\nPleasure there and we got lots of room on the board here of Bob wants to talk about a day wants to talk about it then he wants to talk about it and then he said something about talking about anti Semitism and I'm thinking to myself\nThis could be anti anything this can be anti black people anti Hispanic anti Catholic you can just name but there's\nSomebody out there with an axe to grind in our society is this is good as we can do right a\nChance to win a thousand dollars again you're always game for that right we do a lot of fun things here and one of 'em is we try to give away a thousand dollars and\nBanned it is that time again two hundred two hundred as the tax number\nOne thousand dollars now\nThan nationwide word or two hundred and two hundred you'll get a tank confirming in three months I heard radio in\nSt or data and Mrs rates apply in this nation mine contests and luck than two hundred two hundred [noise] [noise]\nWell let me tell you about my dad is Dr Larry ... doctor of dentistry you're going to find him in Poland candies right across from ... and\nWhat you're gonna find as a dentist that is very caring about your dental health and all he has to do is go seven five seven Seventeen twenty two and you have got yourself with appointment with Dr alerted novels where I go\nAnd I think that you'll enjoy having him take care of your dental work Dr Larry ... doctor of dentistry all around good guy and uh you'll find that he'll take very good care of your teeth because he really has a very very good that's a ...

oh say someone to talk to David Wray the president is sending troops to the border and ah I Want to get the perspective from the federation for American immigration reform what that means so that you'll have that information\nThat will come up at eleven over six this morning but\nBetween now and then I'd like to take as many calls as I can on the synagogue shooting well one of my thoughtful listeners out here says Dan [noise]\nI think what would stop these attacks is to publicly humiliated these perpetrators I'm Talking about something similar to go back and put them in stock so to speak put them out in the public social media and then execute them publicly\nIt sounds barbaric but I think it would be deterred to these guys who see them\nAs heroes now there's let's set comes from a a thoughtful person that I Know and I'm going out and publicly humiliating them\nI guess what bothers me most is I sit here today and I think many of us will go\nA week from now and we'll forget about this will have a church meeting while the council meeting we'll have our daily life and we will be\nSubject to anybody out there that wants to do harm to America\nAnd as I started off by saying I tell you what\nSomebody comes up to me and says you know we need some other gun legislation and I mean if it ... going back and really going through the process to obtain a weapon I think many of us gun owners would go for that I think we would I really would\nLike I missed that can you basically reschedule on that one or maybe you know let's just rescheduled that one may be closer to Halloween I blew that myself\nI'm biking I produced a show together and sometimes we're not on the same page and um [laughter] that's a guess that we I I don't want to interrupt but we're going to talk about right now but let's go down the line is I promise we would here is Bob in Austin Town Bob good morning\nAgain um you know a lot being sounding corny\nMaybe they're sold festivities I mean they're given things like everybody else and [noise] sometimes I think there is no answering this like maybe ... or ... or not and natural you know because I I really see no solution I'm going to be real quick too quick points\nAnd it's just terrible thing happened on CNN down here they go again even furtive struggled drop what his rhetoric it's old white people like me from our generation or bigoted and racist and I'm tired of hearing it that's all they say\nThey had a Jewish lady on this morning you say would you walk and Donald Trump common face some concern with no so where where's all this uh come by I we're we're all just going to give that kind of foreigners\nAnd you know the York more than I Do wear his crown point is that in Brooklyn or the Bronx\nCrown heights\nCrown heights and I'm not talking about crown heights\nThat that is on the ... you know what I I don't want to be ... feet\nAnd killed and it wasn't by that so called people's CNN saying it's crazy white people\nI'm not I'm not sure exactly what housing area you know it's it's close to 'em as close to Brooklyn a it is it's not in Manhattan It's either the borough of Brooklyn queens or the Bronx uh in that area but you're right here's the thing about it Bobby end up\nWe all need to you you go ahead and you substitute the word Jews for Christians or whomever they're going to be targets of people that maybe it's going to be taught me remember it was um [noise] it was the Hindus at one time it it it's everybody the thing about it that we've got to\nHere's the thing about it we don't want to live this way no\nWe do not want to live this way and if people are coming up as you can tell you they have the answer and we need to go back out here and hunker down I suppose that's what you do in the short time but right now it is far too easy for somebody to have\nAn AR Fifteen I'm not saying you shouldn't have one but I Want to know exactly whom you are and why I Want to know the history of that weapon\nAnd where it's going and you know what you have today are Fifteen or if it's a semi automatic pistol we have allowed way too many guns on the streets of our cities and I got to tell you one thing\nThese people that have these guns on the city in the streets you look around at the neighbors out there that are living in fear while we members of the n._r._a. have gone back and saying we want no more gun control I think we have to be thinking about who gets the weapons and you know what\nAnd I got your point amazingly he said you want to get them done thank you for your call he wants to bring these people down here's my point and I've said this over and over again I'm tired of saying it\nSubstitute any group in there they could have gone down you're not going to be able to go out and find everybody that has an axe to grind we have been grinding axes in this country what's the difference now these people can have weaponry\nOf basically mass destruction at their fingertips\nWe can't allow people like this guy to possess a gun that he can do that much damage with or any gun at all let's go to Steve Steve Dan ... good morning\nYeah you know I think you're you have a wrong here because you you don't realize that you're talking about taking away the tool that causes mass destruction and what are you going to you know when you take away they are Fifteen you take away the semi automatic weapon\nI think I don't know I Know you've ... you've read me completely wrong I'm saying you're not taking those away from me because I have shown a propensity to be able to actually uh you know prove that I can I can have one ...\nTalking about taking away from the ... the money for what we don't even know the Ninety percent or let's just say for argument's sake we know who the person that will take away their ability to to have that firearm okay they're gonna find another way they've done it and\nI Wish I Wish I Wish they would I Wish they would use the car I Wish they would have used a knife\nNowhere and you can say that and that's that's the great thing you know you don't you know how many more innocent people walking down the street kill like cars you know that our mind and\nGet out I bet that's ridiculous you know cars are not meant to kill and I worry about that when people talk about that\nAll right we'll reset the lines and back in the second on by Seventy W. K. being\nIf somebody tells you a story and the people they say that we're there don't remember any of its does that make the story believable or true I guess it does in some people's minds in mind that casts\nA lot of doubt on that story to begin with Ron Herman Monday through friday and three\n[noise] All right let's go to Michael out at our good friends over the coin shop in ... Michael for the wheels get new ... new lectures on Mondays and tell us what you do\nOh here's the coin shop where we do is we buy and sell gold silver precious metals rare coins gold coins pretty much

also assessing the value coin collection is whether you have a we panic collection Indian Head pennies Morgan silver dollars walking liberties anything you have of value that you may want to know what you can get for come on in order to give you a free friendly appraisal and if you want to sell it we're going to pay rate than almost by if you want to keep it we're still going to thank you for coming in the show is you're going to\nKnow that that that's nice and you could get a little education they're going to go to school what are you to see you you know\n[laughter] I Do I educate my customers you know there's a lot of people out there that just thrown number that you take or leave it and you don't know how they come up with that number and that's not good business [laughter] I'll tell you\nI can get a hundred dollars for that I'm going to pay a Ninety five or Ninety two so I could afford to keep the lights on here and make a few dollars from my pocket and I'm going to pay you most of the money I'm going to take a small profit and make everybody happy you can read my reviews on Google Search coin shop of Youngstown\nTalk to your friends about me I've got a good reputation honest unfair and I work hard to maintain\nThat alright director when you're on the road but if you need to rush in seven five five fourteen hundred Michael thanks for calling extent seven five five fourteen hundred for directions\nRain well in the afternoon the second part of the day will be fairly nice for like ... cigar box dorm team twenty seven years is the better team day for tomorrow partly cloudy with a high of sixty Wednesday sixty one Thursday fifty to friday fifty three\nRight now forty three it's chilly out there [noise] then you're not making a lot of sense of a a person who wants to commit a crime with a\nGun will probably use an illegal gun how do you prevent that well here's my point and I understand that this seems a little bit of character but what is the lynchpin his not juices not Hindus Assad Catholics it's not Christians\nIs hatred it is people that have the hatred of others and you're not going to be able to find out what you've got to keep those people that have the aid from getting a gun legal or illegal this guy had this guy had a gun permit\n[noise] he was he was not well known to the police the only thing that we did know some of his his postings on Facebook\nWe're going to have to make sure that people that want to threaten that there we go back and we look again we look again at their background I'm thinking here's you know just just to dampen here for a minute I'm thinking that if in fact you are going to order\nThen you have to be well known to the police and you have to be well known as a U.S probably goes counter to the entire thought about gun ownership here in America what keeps us free but you tell me something else is making a difference right now\nYou know damn well that there are far too many guns on the streets of major cities everywhere these people put us in a constant state of drama just like David is alluding to trauma trauma trauma that's what we are in right now are and we David\nI Would totally agree with you sir one hundred percent\nUm I I worked in hospitals for years as a crisis councilor and all I see right now is the entire population I mean those the louder ones of the population just completely in a traumatic experience for the last two and a half years or so\nUm it in order to get over and use that term lightly in order to get over drama you have to have some sort of healing an acknowledgement of what's going on\nAnd unfortunately blaming one side or the other sister Italy is not going to solve anything without any just real talk about what's going on which president right now and how could we move on and\nYou know here's something we're we're now experiencing what inner city has experience for the last Twenty years and we know if you're living in a trauma center you know that these people are going to the hospitals and people were two people killed and young sound last week I mean that that's that's their Pittsburgh isn't it\nOh well I guess so yeah I mean you have to sit by the matter where you live trauma hits all races leaves everything\nAnd by not saying that I think us and them just makes more of a division and more uh ... cannot be healed until you say we eat together\nThat is correct so that hearing would be on the spot or they don't have enough people you know you have the the amount of people are talking about they have to then at MIT them into the United states and keep them in custody\nOnce they come in and say the words political asylum at basically crosses the threshold\nThat allows them to have a hearing once that is granted then they're given a hearing ... sometimes two to three years in the future and given paperwork to disappear into the United you know to to\nTo move on into the interior of the country\nDavid David logistically no if in fact I Am talking to this officer and I claim moose asylum cause or do they make sure that you're going somewhere in the teary or the United states where you have relatives or do we not even go that far do we just simply say there's the door go into Mexico and Texas\nWell if you have family in the United states you will be given a ticket if you have sponsors in the United states you'll be reconnected with them sometimes the sponsors are illegal aliens\nIf they're unaccompanied children which uh which come over and large numbers\nThey try to reunite you with a relative inside the country it's an ... it's an enormous mess which is why fair called last week for Congress to come back to stop campaigning\nAnd come back and close these asylum loopholes we have made it far too easy for people like Central American let's face it they're ... if they truly were leading from the government of Honduras or El Salvador or Guatemala there in Mexico\n... shop in Mexico in fact today David Mexico has offered an asylum in Mexico said will settle you are we promised you a job and all of this stuff but that I don't know if they're just a talking but they have offered this that well\nThat that right in and of itself should be sufficient reason to uh\nAcross the board turn down their asylum claims the other issue is this if you want to ask for political asylum you can do so at the U.S consulate in\nYour home country what they are doing is coming to the border\nAnd in a politically motivated act\nChallenging the sovereignty of United States\nAnd forcing us to let them in the country are these people are coming for economic reasons not because they are ... are being politically persecuted they're openly saying that's all they want is a good paying job in the United states and let's face it so does everyone else and those people are getting in line\nAnd applying to come here as legal immigrants there's no good reason to allow these folks to jump the head of of everyone else in line\nBut they're doing it because they're kind of bum rushing\nOr the gate well you know what is the political motivation behind this they uh you know there was a a former member of the Honduran a Congress who started heading this up\nAnd he had a you know there's been talk that there's been funding from the government of Venezuela and so on certainly money was put forth\nAnd this thing grew and grew people know that you know what you can get away with and what you can't envy the whole uh asylum a scam and the fact that if you show up with a child that you can't be held more than twenty days because of a legal agreement from decades ago called the Flores settlement\nSo people are coming with their children knowing that it's their children are basically there get out of jail free card can't be held more than twenty days if you have a child with you so you're released into the interior that is the essence of of the ... of the uh\nUh catch and release program that we've been hearing about for all these\nNewly review for those people just listening right now if in fact these immigrants make it to some place like war as which is a lot further than ... only a thousand miles away right if they make it there and they say to a border guard I Am seeking political asylum that gives them a hearing with the federal government\nThat entitles them to a hearing there seven hundred thousand cases ahead of them good so do the math on that we\nHad him for years we don't just say we're going to put you back into Mexico we actually allow them to come into the United states and we release them into the interior of the states\nYeah I mean we the threshold for asking for political asylum particularly for somebody coming from a country where they are safe I e Mexico it's ridiculously low so we've asked for Congress to\n... to heighten the threshold for you know you have to make a claim how you have to show how your government is it is you know selecting you out\nSo we would reject Mexican David David Wray with the federation for American immigration report if we would reject the Mexican at the border um you're saying that we would not necessarily let them into the interior because\nWe're going we're past history that you're not being oppressed in Mexico\nWell yet by and large are Mexicans are returned to automatically to Mexico Canadians are returned automatically Canada ah they're they're usually not coming here asking for political asylum\nWhat about Chinese or someone of another nationality\nWell there there's all sorts of nationalities now that are shows that are coming in over the border and some of them are embedded with this caravan actually who will be asking for political asylum and then be released into the interior of the country it really is a national security issue\nWe have to make a major change in Congress now to say that people from Central America or not automatically given a I'm a ...\nThe ability to come into the United states is that likely that we could change that\nWell I you know there are some things that Congress can easily close those loopholes is it likely that we can get sixty demo or enough Democrats to vote for it to get it through the Senate or another Democrat you know the Republicans tried it\nWhile stupid are weird though if you think about this David and I'm not going to mince words how stupid are we when we're having in Beijing and we know exactly what they're going to do and we can't find a hundred congressman that should all be on the same page\nWell you know the uh there were two efforts by Republicans earlier this year now this is with more of an all inclusive immigration bill and they got both both bills had\nA lot of support from ... from the Republican Party has zero support from the Democratic party but not enough to get them pass the house of representatives\nPeople need maybe we need to select out this asylum a reform by itself and the vote on this\nCertainly a couple of senators have suggested a signing a what's called a safe third country agreement with Mexico that says that anybody who comes through Mexico uses Mexico is a factor to get to the United states to ask for political asylum\nThat simply the fact that they had been in Mexico would\nYou are if you have a child with you especially your released within twenty days or somewhere to the interior of the United states where the court date somewhere down the road as long as three or four years down the road now let's say eighty percent of these folks at least don't show up\nFor their hearings Ninety percent of Central Americans if they do show up for their hearings do not get political asylum in the United states this is the way to get make\nYourself to the front of the line to cut your way in using our generous asylum laws that are now being misused by people who should not be coming here in the first place you know it's it's you know a\nA coincidence that this is happening right before the most important mid term elections probably in our lifetime\nI and that this is being orchestrated by a a a leftist politician initiated by you know from from Honduras with the help of the Venezuelan government very likely\nAnd that this is turning into a huge mess on our border\nCongress needs to fix our asylum laws they need to fix it now if they can't agree on anything else it should be that we should have the ability to help those who are truly fleeing political persecution but to keep those out those people out who are coming here you know simply to sidestep\nAre well I don't think I've ever had anybody that has given such a\nConcise I'm\nA presentation as to what the current laws are David I thank you for that we'll talk about it we'll talk about it in the call and you're from time to time\nI Love coming on with it in any time\nThank you very much David Wray federation for American immigration reform laying right out
