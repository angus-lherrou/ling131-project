from a lot of our storm chasers they were down at the impact on landfall and they're saying that Panama City in a lot worse than the video we've seen so far and they're saying the area around in the air force base is very bad in that Mexico beach area is horrendous\nWell I heard this guy on one of our sister said she just had to call him Pete combs is down there and beat what I heard you yesterday you were talking about um you were going to watch that a tide go in but you were going to run up to the second floor is that correct\nYeah actually on the fourth floor and you're now is the fourth or story walk up this hotel because there's no power here no elevators certainly no air\nConditioning you think about that Florida even on October ... air conditioning\nAnd that sort of the personal story of the aftermath but a Panama City beach Panama City all of the county has been under a curfew that ends in about twenty three minutes or and so only now are people going to really be able to get out and get a strong assessment of what's been going on uh in in the past few hours you'll\nStuart was really quick when it came through here lasted through\nIt about four hours but it was almost a cat five two mile an hour wind speed is all they kept her for being a cat five and I'll tell you what will spot you the two miles an hour down here at the beach\nAbsolutely know what I heard yesterday you said that you were going to see the storm surge coming in and what a ... near you drop the fourth floor that\nHotel apparently held up well\n\nIt did this was built to Andrew code after Hurricane Andrew the Florida building code got really tight and these buildings are supposed to withstand winds of up to a hundred and fifty miles an hour we didn't get a direct hit here in Panama City beach that was about twenty eighty twenty miles to the east of us and Mexico beach there\nDevastation fourteen foot storm surge buildings washed out to sea others lost their ruse people even in concrete block building say the earth seem to move on to their feet as this storm wall up their buildings from overhead\nPaid you were talking about the speed of this storm so I'm at the height of the storm here what were you hunker down for maybe three or four hours where you were just watching the storm and then the ease up right after that and the ease up a lot\n\nYou know it is not as a it wasn't like an instant thing it really hit the hardest of the winds hit at about twelve o'clock that's when we got into the the wind field the hurricane Winfield as the storm was moving north through the Gulf\nUm you know by about two o'clock it was amazing it was an incredible sight to see you know you see the pictures of the aftermath mhm that man to see that actually happening with trees snapping off\nOr in the in the wind you know building bending over about forty five fifty degrees and the snap there are there now nothing more than stumps it was like watching the fist of got punched through these signs these plastic and billboard signs and watch the uh the material explode outward\nSome buildings or they lost the walls they were pushed in by the wind and others lost their roof was ripped off by the wind\nUm and so now what they're dealing with this sort of looking at the damage the aftermath but that's going to be very hard especially in some of these residential neighborhoods that are tree line because the trees are lining the streets anymore trees are in the streets\nUp he died I heard you talking yesterday to one of our sister stations and you were talking about is this was coming in the storm surge\nAnd you were saying that it may not get the ... it's going to be a lower population area that really did you hear is that true is this how this went through it didn't destroy as much as it could have been hit a very high population area\nYeah I got a sense that that was that the case because what you're talking about areas like Mexico beach where the storm surge was up to fourteen feet\nYou're talking about areas that are resort areas but there's only one way in and out so people pretty much we're we're very keen to heed the call to move out when they when they had the chance I'm here in a in a Panama City beach\nJohn John John John ... the general manager came in and he was a wheeler dealer man and he wheeled in a deal and he brought a lot of people in here then will eventually march pyro took over and they have\nA a steady sport for that has been very beneficial for the city of Cleveland oh no question there yeah you got it but in any case that's one of the things that do we have to be thankful for here because you think about the ... center people go back to your global corruption\nAnd all kinds of controversy is going to cost ten million dollars that we don't have and they're going to have to finance part of it and they you know we were trying to figure out how we're going to do what George McCovey was trying to figure it out and\nEat they finally did get it done and now we have a place where Keith Urban arguably one\nOf the top pop country stars going to come in here and get a player 'til belly center that doesn't happen everywhere\nAnd a regular stop for a period there for Elton John for God's sake or any of these does is Alice Cooper robs zombie you can go on and on John Mellencamp bill it\nI mean it's become an entertainment hub and it's gotten so big that when you plant that seat of the valley center now you've got all those restaurants and bars and we got a hotel\nAnd ate the same as it used to be but we're coming back by got\nYeah but you know when you get the ... center out there you you get a bill and if it's a good idea wouldn't have been a shame if you think about this if\nThat money had been dissipated and it would have been used to make parking lots downtown and now you would just have big big parking lots\nYeah but I Would like a little more parking downtown and I never thought I Would say that in my lifetime [laughter]\nAnd now we've got the EPA theater coming up too\nYeah yeah they're they're putting up some walls down there so that's a good thing we get some crazy things but I think it's you always have to keep in mind\nWhen you actually get something built you can figure out how to run it later when you get that brick and mortar in there\nBecause of your gateway and Cleveland is very controversial because they were going to actually the beer drinkers and the cigarette smokers and they did um and that's how they paid for a lot of it and then of course it was a controversial uh as to whether or not and has ever been really paid for same thing with ... still we're still paying that ten million dollars back\nBut interesting how they are funding what is now the the new amphitheater\nUm they're getting a nice grant from the Youngstown foundation for the naming rights they're getting they're seeking other grants and then there are also seeking long term bond so there is a way to do it it's called walking and chewing gum and de ... bigger not how to do it you got to do it you know there's always said you can't just plows no do security [laughter]\nYou're right you're right about where we go get like would it take a short break [noise]\n\nAs time goes I don't you think that there seems to be a growing segment in our society the backs socialism instead of capitalism I find that very troubling seems to me the economy's going in the right direction with plenty of job opportunities for those who want to work Ron verb Monday through friday at three\nAnd

band brothers dot com these news radio ...\nSeventy selling you Katie\nI'm Sherry pressed in just a devastating storm over to\nGovernor Rick Scott a day after his state was planned by category for hurricane Michael\nThe economy has been better than anybody had expected\nSo is that what Eric Holder is saying he says is diverse demographic to be as tough as they are to be dedicated as they are to be committed as they are he says\nThe Democratic party we're proud as hell to be Democrats and we're going to fight for the ideals of the Democratic party\n[noise] what were the ideals that we had so much trouble in the middle east you how many hearts are broken how many lives were basically taken apart when you think about\nThe men that were lined up in orange jumpsuits led to the sea and their heads cut off\nFor whatever reason I don't know maybe ISIS get tired of that Gore on television but maybe they got back into a corner where they couldn't operate\nBecause the current administration started going after them and started killing them and making them run\nWho can forget the poor man who was killed in a cage with fire we don't see those videos any more frightened the hell out of most of the world that was during the tail end of the Obama administration\nSo is that what Eric Holder's against that we have gone back and I'm sure if he was here he would be saying well no no no no he said that self probably would've just happened and we would have gotten rid\nOf the scourge of ISIS in our time\nBut I don't ever remember correct me if I'm wrong and I guess my question is to you\nIf you're a Democrat are you still a Democrat in the Eric Holder mode where he saying this for the new Democratic Party is about we're proud as hell to be Democrats and we're going to take up the way the this this this Trump thing then the guy's a board\nThat's international though and that that's not at home that's not at home but and I I don't want to go and crow too much about ISIS because I understand that ISIS will be back it's an ideology they're going to find a way to come back and make our life miserable\nAll over the world is their ideology that's what they're going to try to do\nBut again\nDonald Trump with his generals took the fight to them and neutered them at least for the time being\nIt's off the front page right now make no mistake it will be back it'll be back then as I said that's international maybe not something that affects us every day and especially not here in the heart heartland of the United states\nThey choose to typically get bigger population areas but then you come back to the local and you're saying well Youngstown has recovered with some jobs\nWe've recovered we have jobs to offer but we're still way behind the rest of the state [noise]\nSo if we can't fill the jobs here that we have the rest of the state must be darn booming right people go into Columbus and going to Cincinnati and Toledo and other places it must be must be really good the rest of Ohio because we continue to hear that are unemployment rate is higher than most\nBut I don't think it's because of the opportunity I think there's opportunity here time and time again I hear people talking about if you show up\nIn your trainable you do ... you know be on the down low you can get a good job\nThat's changed that his changed from two thousand eight to two thousand Eighteen it is better in the United states for people seeking jobs\nSo is that what Eric Holder wants to talk about is that what he wants to take apart so this new election coming up we're going to go back and we're going to take apart whatever Donald Trump has done with job gains\n\nAnd go ahead you know I'm not going to be the commentary goes out here and says okay it's all because of the Republicans at all because of a Donald Trump but some of it's not accidental some of it's not some of it's cyclical I get it you know\nI'm not going to be so we get this to say that Obama did nothing right maybe the seeds were sold for this recovery\nBut Donald Trump's president right now that Eric Holder on what grounds are you going back and say we are going to fix this country we're proud of the future that we will create for this country\nWell let's go to something else as a a little more personal\nWhat about the people out here that have tried to get on Obamacare and they couldn't afford it because the Obamacare the various levels is almost\nAlmost in comprehensible to think that people were going to do the Affordable CARE Act and most people said well you know I really can't afford that I Can't afford it it's just way too much eight hundred to a thousand dollars a month more than I have\nAnd then if I Do have it it just becomes catastrophic healthcare because in many cases I have to pay five\nSix seven ten thousand dollars before it actually kicks in catastrophic health care so is that the cornerstone of what the Obama administration has given us if that's true it's not all that good at it\nYou come back and you say OK how much difference have we made in trying to ensure the forty thousand people who were uninsured\nThat's the number that they wish forty thousand people well by most figures are saying that nine thousand people have taken up with Obamacare and if you talk to those nine thousand people are going to find out more and more of them are not happy with it\nOne of the ways that we actually help some people here in the Buckeye State was the John Case they expanded the numbers of people that could be on Medicaid so that ... a lot\nBut the thing about these people look at it as Obamacare the oil that's not that I was a great that's a that's a cornerstone of the Obama administration\nAnd then you go back to international for whatever reason Kim John ... is now behaving\nI don't know\nHe's probably he's probably a pro Vera cater he's probably someone that can be trusted 'em we know that he said desperate that in prisons as people\nBut right now he's quiet this thing he's quite is that is that an accident\nIs it an accident that the north Atlantic Treaty Organization numbers are now paying the proper amount of dues and it's not just the United states is that accidental is that what Eric Holder wants to talk about\n\nSo this is the Democratic party this is what they want to take ... take apart [noise] I tend to believe that it is probably and I and I can go on a hit hit other points to but I I tend to believe\nThat Donald Trump his personality has rub people so badly that people have decided this man is not fit for public office this man cannot be in polite crowds\nHe goes out he mugs for the camera he says things off the wall he doesn't prepare for debates with Hillary Clinton\n\nHe talks in generalities he does a lot of he he does he does a tremendous amount\nOf a delegation but somehow the world's working right now it's better than it was\n\nIt's Eric Holder that thinks that the it's the wall hits the wall people always want to talk about this wall that they want to do let me quote from I'm a writer named Brad heath\nFederal drug trafficking prosecutors along the southwestern

competition it's easy with our problem and we know what ...\nWhat do you see now seven to nine nine nine Seventy seven don't\nForget our news slim down version of our ... minded as five Seventy WKBD into some key word rivers more all night to your shot to talk to them next and\nBack to these five Seventy W Caribbean into the Danbury strode room and um we can we can take off on the topic that I just talked about um in ... that's kind of this uh what\nIs there to change what is there to change right now I mean um do we have a country that is that divided that we have got to go out and we have to change the Republican administration\nIt tell me folks do I have blinders on you know maybe maybe do do I have blinders on or or things going along okay here at\nThe same for the tornado in the hurricanes and you know Georgia has a tornado watches now after this and we have flooding and we have hurricanes and all that and God Knows what's coming next and up you know we have illegal aliens still coming across the country\nLots of lots of 'em coming into our country things are not perfect\nBut by by all thoughts here say for General Motors and what they have done here did all the local valley and a lot of that is because we kinda got unlucky in that fuel prices have remained low\nYou think about this I mean you know what the cruise would probably be the flavor of the day if in fact we didn't have oil prices that have been well below a hundred dollars a barrel for about five years though\nThat's taken the devastation a devastating toll on the compact cars and we get caught we get caught the vortex\nAnd you know things happen like that and it's probably not going to be something that we're going to be able to do anything about but for the most part it has been a pretty good time here during the last two years accidental yeah baby\nYou know it really gripes people is they look at Donald Trump and they think you're as a bumbling stumbling guy that is unprepared and he's just got the luck of the draw in the economy that's what people think\nBut somehow behind the scenes you see people that are taking away regulations unleashing the financial engine that is out there and it's working\nAnd so now people saying well we got to change this\nWhat's the argument for changing it I don't know let's start with calls we'll start with calls I mean I I throw this topic out there simply because this election we have coming up is important if you want to continue the progress that we have made here in the country and you know we haven't even gotten to healthcare yet\nMost people will say really the only way to get anywhere with healthcare is to have a single payer system\n[noise] but I don't know most people are pretty happy with their Social Security but they have a supplement there's just no way that we probably could afford that right down\nThe system we have is terribly inefficient but I Would hope that the next healthcare system that we bring in which we will would be one that sticks one that makes some sense one that actually does in short\nPeople without violating the people that are on it\nWhich I had better news for you on the Dow but it is now a it is open that a hundred and eleven now that doesn't mean anything though I mean that could just be a leftover from yesterday things that are already in the pipeline but\nUh it's down a hundred and twenty seven points again this morning we'll start with our first call on five Seventy do keep me as we get a warrant Hi good morning\nMorning how are you All right well\nYeah you know you're kind of talking about the Democrats are or what exactly drives people to be part of that and you know I think it's all a cultural issue are more they just want to be outraged be outrage and walk power um you\nKnow they keep talking about illegal immigration all they want with illegal immigration is the votes there is a new study out on that just came out\nYou know and and the number that's being put them pushed for years is twelve to fourteen million mhm uh illegals it's twenty two million per this ... study and I mean you're talking literally just like eight or nine percent of the U.S population paralegal\nIf that's not going to ... that's not a graft or vote I don't know what it is\nI you you you look around here and you think about the people that are living in the shadows here you know it just thinking about this too is that really good for people to I mean you you've got people out here that basically are having to live\nYou know piled on top of each other ... I don't know if you watch this last night but it was on one of the new shows\nBut you have people been California that are living eight ten twelve people per homes and California is becoming the people that have lots of money and the people that have none there you are seeing an example of um [noise] you know the middle class just being just being thrown away\nWell you're in that California is a great example of what what Democrats the rich get richer the poor get poorer and nobody can afford anything\nYou know you're going to fit you're going to get a lot of talking points today um you know with people supporting Democrats talking about the Dow Jones oh well it's down to a hundred police yesterday and it down a hundred and eleven voice today or whatever you just said\nYou know what that's called a functioning economy you know it's kind of auctioning stock market you know we had for years under the Obama administration really know gangs and really no losses my new and what we have with with this is we actually have giant gave Warren ...\nAnd then they have to say the vice to argue the guy the guy I saw here was a he was angling for the uh he was angling for the Fifteen dollar wage and um I was running for\nGovernor lieutenant governor I'm I thought you meant\nYou had might have been something else but I did see it and they're just going to say that I heard him angling for the idea that we need to Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage involving explain\nHow dangerous that is so thank you very much I just wanted to clear that Wagner and war for the ones Ryan ... is a total socialist and so is that are meant so we need to get Wagner bar tests and the state of Pennsylvania and cup a newly tenet governor so I don't have that other\nPerson is but I had to get in a hundred and ten million you know they'll lose their health\nPlans under this so called gonna save everybody nonsense single payer you know\nWell you know what I I I'm a little wishy washy on this from this viewpoint here because um I don't really know how these insurance companies make these payments I just had a small injury and I saw the cost of that\nAnd it's it's just an unbelievable that we can actually continue to have health care as much as it's gotten out of hand uh on what it costs and I know everybody has to be paid but you don't tend to just kind of crazy it seems that every hospital you see you know has to be almost like a Taj Mahal\nBut I I don't ... I don't get that because you know what we're talking about is the saving of lives and the technology within these hospitals but all too often it's kind of a tip of the hat to the people who donate the money and we we put in some kind of a a Taj Mahal and we've we've got to start rolling back costs on medical and college\nWell you know people have to do that as a personal decision themselves and not just thinking their answers in the medical model and expect and everybody else to pay for it\nAnd others spent last two letters and the Tribune review about uh they get shot there as fast as they can it UPN say and they believe that maybe it's just they're saving money because they're not really taking care of the patients therapy\nYou know you know so I mean while this input into this so called\nThis isn't healthcare this is this is people's where they want to go to get these treatments and ah you know what my parents do I know basically they probably had a minimal a health insurance plan but you know anything the government subsidizes again costs more money and\nThat's where we are going to give me thirty seconds on the gubernatorial race in Pennsylvania you just mentioned between wolf and who\nSenator Scott Wagner he came in about four years ago he is a real a fiscal conservative he supported by Americans for prosperity or if he ... he just basically a wants to roll back the regulations that you know hurting business\nIs very concerned about the shell taxis being beat up totally destroyed by ... who has a lot of money and claiming a though in Pennsylvania we don't have a shell tax but we have an impact tax and that pays for in the area where roads and bridges and different things for\nUpkeep of you know to help with that and it's helped a lot in Pennsylvania but he's lying and he wants and that new tax so the people that don't want to get their their dirt dirty or whatever with fracking than they can get money you know the overall so I mean there's the guy but he's a\nHe's been sort of devastating in the primary and he needs to win and Pennsylvania on November Sexton his running mate is Jeff ... and uh they're definitely\nA on the side of like letting the government stay out of our lives that have a\nVery well listen thank you for ... for and lightning me I'll have to give us a ... do they do that appreciate it thank you\nSo much Regina by somebody double duty be it'll be the first to tell you I don't know everything I Do some things such as [noise]\nBack in a minute [noise]\nJust\nWas over it's insane when you'd be wrong to

like right you can have a very stripped down version of the window world blind window or you could have it all trimmed up into\nThe er some more isn't that something a lot of our customers scholars you know we've been calling around for us much and they won't come out if we only want one window where two windows and not only that they won't come out if both my husband and me aren't home\nYeah and that's a little bit different because uh you know we're going to come out and we're going to give everybody a A R a fair shot\nAnd give him the price and that's what it is we don't have any of those bogus discounts to worry about\nVery well that thank you very much for your call and do we just lose you there no thank you very much for calling southern boulevard and your phone number\nOkay

can't a promise money that you have not made there are ... they're still going to be people such as Robert ... who is a scholar in the Clinton Administration and the Obama administration who basically says what do we have to have a livable wage we have to have a minimum wage\nPeople are touting this even though it makes no economic sense none\n... you know Danny I live with that one I was younger I started working when I when I started when I was eight stocking shelves in my uncle and my grandfather's for [noise] but\nUm the minimum wage was a buck thirty five an hour in Nineteen sixty seven and then I moved in sixty nine I moved to thirty five\nYou ever think about this what what if there would would have been no minimum wage back then it may have been higher\nWell you know even though they have a mandate like that it's tough to get it now look waitresses my first wife was a waitress and they tax tips and I said she's not even meant to fifty an hour and it's Nineteen eighty six\n...
