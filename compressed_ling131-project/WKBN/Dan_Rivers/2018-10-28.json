{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Where they go okay I understand so yeah it doesn't have Twenty years of experience but yes the mechanical background from doing stuff on his own or hit her on\nBy so it's sort of you and say Chris Allen is with us I really enjoy talking with Chris from Valerie than I did and I do that because\nI like I said he is a guy that really has a passion for saying\nTo young people there is a good living out here that we offer and if you get to what we need and vocational school as a young student oriented as an adult in this kind of stuff you don't need to have huge college debt in many cases you in many cases you'll make more than anybody with a college degree without the debt\nAnd like you say what I like about them is to say the environment that you're working in has changed dramatically from from your father's generation and one other thing that he teaches is to say in the hiring process is different because you talk a little bit about that process you guys go through\nA so nowadays a lot of companies don't have paper applications anymore so you do have to uh fill out an application online electronic an electronic application\nNow tell folks in your particular case how do they check the jobs and start that process\nSo you go to Valerie jobs online dot com that's Valerie jobs online dot com\nOr you select the right location so that website actually has all of our locations in North America that includes Canada the U.S and Mexico\nOr in within the U.S we have multiple locations\nAre here in Youngstown see one click on Youngstown yeah you wanna make sure you're clicking on the there's Valerie star Youngstown and there's Pam usa Youngstown huh uh valor start right now is the one with the majority of the openings uh you want to look at there's two categories their salary and there's our\nOr depending on your background and what you're looking for you click on the the appropriate area uh and then those jobs that are open right now will pop up in a list or I Would suggest that you actually before you start your application that you read the job descriptions to make sure that you fit qualifications that we're looking for\nAnd talk a little bit about that because this is another great point he makes there are requirements wants and needs or talk about\nIt I must in prefer okay when you get down to that section is going to say you must have X Y Z or whatever it is and then we do prefer if you have this also also\nWhat they're saying under ... you must have is what is the qualifications to do the job\nSo you need to look at that makes sure that you fit those qualifications and then you go ahead and apply typically you're going to see for jobs in that area that is going to be the production operate in the middle right electrician an electronics technician I'm In each one has different qualifications and what works\nBut I must have some must that is what you have to have but if you don't have the we would prefer that doesn't eliminate you\nKnow it doesn't it's just a an extra thing that would be you have a would be nice to see that somebody has that\nSame but it does sound eliminate you and you don't have it now\nIf you're unsure about what you want to apply for or what you should apply for\nGenerally I tell everybody apply for the production operator position that way it will will with definitely review it and if we see that you have some qualifications and might fit into something else will contact you and say okay we think we're ... are you okay with us moving it over here because we think that you can uh achieve that\nAll right so you apply online then what's the next process\nOr you apply online you complete the application and another thing that we run into quite a bit is people don't load the resume into their application and it's a requirement [laughter] um we ended up my team ends up having to go out and call these people and say hey we need you to put your resume and there we can see what you did mhm I'm so make sure that you do that\nAnd then after that complete um you'll if if you are after it's reviewed if it looks like you said the qualifications or you'll get contacted by somebody from my team to get scheduled to come in for a an onsite test them for what we call an assessment\nAh and that's conducted takes about to get I think we give you up to three hours to take a after that's complete all of that information is reviewed and then we decide who were calling in for the interview\nA you then you come in for an interview\nI typically that interview uh is going to last about an hour a that's done in a group or so you're going to see a two three at the most for people sit down with you or go over your background your qualifications in the last few other questions and then the decision is made as to whether or not we're going to hire the candidate from there\nRight so it's it's not a process to be afraid of you know it's a it's relatively easy thing you go\nOnline website again is Valerie jobs online dot com R. H. you you you go to a click on USA writer and this is usa click on Youngstown valor started Youngstown, Ohio and then you'll see the job opportunities there's the minimum requirements you want to make sure you have those yes\nAnd uh and if you have any of the preferred that kind of bumps chef but up the ladder limits\nYou fill out the application and submit your resume\nThan the next step is you look them over there called him they're given some testing rights no big deal off in the fear they're not All right and then after that they're called in for an interview and after the interview if they think you're the guy you're hired you're hired\nAnd you've seen this done before have you seen the joy that has come from people that have been hired at thirty or at twenty four solve the same different different ages so very different very young people or people Thirty Years' old people forty years old it\nThe entire\nRange of ages because you know we start we hire people who have worked in the steel industry the steel industry has there's not that many people around to do that anymore but there's still people out there used to work at it but I don't want\nTo say this you also take a chance on people we do I mean you hire people that have were smart enough to get the ... that go to the trade schools and learn the stuff and yeah and you reach out to them\nWe do um in fact we're we're in the process of trying to create a pipeline with some of the vocational schools and trade schools to ah\nCreate some interest in going into a steel career I'm In most of those people were either coming from a a not related I'm a industry or the cameras are coming right out of school young guys and gals coming out of school and um you know we're taking a chance on\nRight so it is and when we talk about they talk a little bit about pay and benefits and what you guys have a ton of dark\nSo typically a production operator position will start off in Nineteen twenty five an hour\nUm maintenance physicians are typically start off around twenty two an hour um\nWe have a pretty good benefits package actually for health insurance you get to choose between three different er here you have three choices we have an aids test they plan with the ... we have an eighty traditionally twenty plan and we have an enhanced Ninety ten plan\nA four one K. plans pretty good we do have matching contributions on that\nAre under the pay on top of what you get paid um\nThey're usually is some built in overtime because we work a rotating shift I it's a forum for off schedule a so you're working for twelve and then you're off for days and\nWhich is a pretty cool schedule it actually is for days on then you get four days off right it's I mean that's a pretty good break\nAnd then another thing that a lot of people are aware of it is we have a monthly matrix\nBonus which is based on uh the performance in the mills um and it's a dollar per hour amounts a there's a bunch of calculations that go into it but based off of their performance you get a a dollar per hour\nPay on top of what your normal pages and that's based on how many hours you work in the entire month\nYou know as as I'm listening to Chris Alan talk I'm just going to tell you guys I Wish I I I Would like to End Days or do they do me a favor I Want to make sure that take out that ah that sixty there and I want to go right up until by time here\nI Wish I could take you in my ... and drive you to every vocational school every trade school and and and ...\nEvery guidance counselor in schools for doing that your message is I'm going to tell you a hundred times is vital you come on here and you offer a living in a damn good one and you come on here and show people away\nAnd there's a lot of people colleges informed that debt isn't forum you're offering a way that fits a lot of people and then you're doing something that I think is equally as important your saying\nThis whole environment isn't like you think it is with your father note and you know if you're a great video games you're great on computers we probably got a pretty good job you're going to love that they would come back we're doing it yeah\nI'm One thing I Want to put out there too before we go is we're planning on having a job fair onsite at the Youngstown location a wild more to come on that Web some advertising coming up in November of but we already have the\n\nTime in seven o clock shot while American source providing hard ... rather some news radio\nFive seven selling you have young [noise]\nMichelle France and we believe this is in fact the deadliest attack against the Jewish community in the history of the United states\nIs a way to really get to the uh uh I guess the root cause that's right of pain in the body um before we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you and I know this is hard for you because this is this is an emotional but\nI think it's important for people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's ... and if you could share their story I'm\nSure well it it it was birth that a lot of personal pain and pain that my husband had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body at the same time I had five on my ... right so I was really on a quest to find something all natural\nTo help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that emu oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain\nI took Amy oil and glucose ... mhm I used Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay realm Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic solver\nThat is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding and repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream\nThat actually has no odor it's grace list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and death in irritate your skin\nGoes in Fifteen minutes later you have freely\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show that I had\nRight because it was and I have this year by the way of folks ... comes in a plastic dispenser that has pumped top on it at\nThe top and it ... you'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay of pain of the nation that sanitary you know ... so you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body then you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also rebuilding re read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply that cream to that area that you're going to target ... okay you get the information to go down in the body\nHeal itself the body heal itself provided you get it the raw materials that needs I'm giving you what you need for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that's he'll okay and this is safe enough and then you have to worry about if you have to worry about a thing\nIf you're taking a drug for pain it won't conflict with that at all none of these ... going to do that okay so what what is then\nIt's a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell\nThem I Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you know then I noticed that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminate it okay and then over time you then to rebuild and repair your joints flip that inflammation being taken down that's going to restore flexibility and mobility and sleep I mean if you can sleep again\nThat's for our bodies get all of our recoup protests regenerative ability to heal\nAnd then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again traveling exercising so you can lose weight right socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all of these are the things you your your can't do are very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life trying to live\nWell you can't you're right you're right live a normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taken care of and you can\nYeah and you've got people out there that are that are already getting great results\nHigher brought some more emails and letters if you'd like to hear a sure okay um let's see Chris yes I'm from ... from California\nI Would love for you to know how happy I Am with your product my feet and legs are usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas I'm able to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nIt's a miracle in a tube that truly does take away the pain it works is nothing else I'd ever tried to work quickly and eliminated all of the pain\nSo to me now these are these\nYou do these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart good to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails or these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people have is my great results\nThat's great [laughter] I also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred two one two four\nSeven eight seven as\nWe've been talking about here Dr Janet's formula is a fast acting glucose ... cream that provides relief on contact for those nagging aches and pains in your joints your neck your back your shoulders maybe your wrists are hands and knees basically anywhere that hurts\nAnd the best part is it's older loose its Greece list and it won't stains so you can use this every day even on to your best clothes the number to call is one\nEight hundred two one two four seven eight seven\nAnd just say you know Dr Jana hasn't raised a very special offers only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief cream\nAgain this is only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven plus if you call the next ten minutes\nYou'll also receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep for yourself or share with a loved one or a friend so folks this is a really great offer again the number to call\nIs one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven\nAnd remember you have absolutely nothing to lose here because Dr Janet's extra strength glucose I mean pain relief formula is guaranteed to be safe and effective or your money back then when you do call in order you will not be enrolled in one of those automatic delivery programs this is a one time order the number to call\nIs one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven and I'll give that to you again you're ready it's one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven [noise] so\nWhat do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is a now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there but looking at it from a natural standpoint\nAnd Dr Jana glucose mean cream maybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again but when\nYou give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue the half the problem and again we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this is\nThis is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and just as good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme it is how minimal it is it's going to get you release\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer take your pain from my pen to a five and ... on the line with continue use mhm I'm telling you that's very doable yeah so this is really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of these things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for glucose in Maine or NSM for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the lightning here taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release and they want it now right and that's why I developed this cream again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nFour seven eight seven and I'll give that to you one more time you're ready it's\nOne eight hundred\nTwo one two\nFour seven eight seven [noise] well that's all the time we have for today thanks again to our sponsor Dr Newton's natural you can visit

not apply to spare for others find heart with online at ... dot com these news radio five Seventy shoveled you caveat young [noise]\nA city wrong finance was while yesterday's shooting at a synagogue\nThat you really want to live I mean hey who wants to live long if you are not productive if you're not able to do what you want to do\nThe only thing separating you [noise]\nThat same success is accepting the fact that you are responsible for your own health genes give us predispositions for certain health problems like high cholesterol and heart disease and things\nBut they only become a problem when we don't feed our body properly when we feed our body\nReally poor quality foods over a long period of time that's when we start to develop problems and that will become more clear to you as you listen to meet each Sunday even if your family has a tendency toward higher cholesterol levels you can make a big difference by lowering that number\nMy uh my lovely wife and her family tend to have high cholesterol and they also have learned to eat him or typical American diet so whether it's genetic or whether it's something that we get from the diet we eat\nIt may be a question for some people but I'll tell you that there may be a genetic predisposition but the diet you eat is the direct thing that affects the health of your blood I've proved that many scientists have proved that people way smarter than me and uh so it's about time we start to pay attention to that\nAnd a proved to your doctor that you can lower your own cholesterol you can\nSo my wife lowered hers even though she has this um what might be considered a a familial hyper cholesterol Amy and that is that her genes just tend to ... you know give her the predisposition toward higher cholesterol but she ... her cholesterol over thirty points in three weeks on a diet and my book\nAnd I've had other people who were told oh you just have genetically high cholesterol you just have to go along with it and do the best you can here take this that and\nAnd uh but people who follow the diet find that they can lower their blood quickly and uh when your cholesterol is high don't forget your blood is essentially thicker than it should be and it flows more slowly as a result this puts more stress on your heart your kidneys specifically on all your organs really\nAnd it reduces oxygen delivery to all your body's cells making you feel tired run down get sick easy lack of ambition and Suzie as I'm sure as heck don't feel like exercising so um you know you can change all that within a few weeks you just need to bite the bullet and get to work\nMy book has a plan to get you started whether you do that or you just take the impetus from that and run with it yourself that's fine the key is eliminating the animal\nProducts the saturated fats and that's what makes the difference so let's get started\nOkay has like can I Want to coax more patients from friends to come on and share their amazing stories in the future I add a lot of good feedback on Jan or had a couple of people stop by the office and they have uh several phone calls actually and people said well she did a great job\nAnd I I Want you to know that is because when it comes from you when it comes from somebody that's experienced it it has more meaning you know I sit here and tell you this over and over and\nYou know ... some people may think of me as an authority I promise you I'm just a regular person like everybody else just have a little bit more scientific knowledge but ah and medical knowledge\nBut ah you know I I fall prey to the same things you do every day and I eat things you know that I should neat\nAnd over time that adds up and degrades our health to the point where oh my God we have a disease we have this something that the only thing that will fix at his drugs if you listen to the popular propaganda out there\nBut look I had a great experience this week in my office one of my patients and older gentleman in his mid seventies shared with me how earlier in a week he exercised at the gym which he never used to be able to do and then came home and wax the car in the garage now this guy's in his mid seventies\nIf you remember I spoke of this gentleman in the past he had diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis and he was literally unable to shower and dress himself in the morning\nLess than a year ago after working on his diet for just five or six months\nHe's now able to get off all his medications he feeling good enough to exercise several times a week and then come home and ... the car you know I Know people in their forties and fifties that don't have that kind of energy or feel that good\nSo what is the difference the difference is that he really put the effort in and removed those little stumbling blocks in his body they kept it from working the way it was designed to work\nAnd so they are my all the credit goes to him it was his persistence and an effort in eating a healthier diet I just pointed them in the right direction\nAnd I'll never take credit for what the beautiful designed it has been put into our body that cannot allow our body to thrive\nNo matter where you're at the forgive ability in this system is amazing\nAnd yeah maybe there are some things that are too far along you know maybe if you have terminal cancer stage for cancers that maybe it's too far gone but nothing surprises me and God Forbid if I ever got cancer you know I\nI can tell you without question and having seen a lot of people go through cancer treatment I personally won't take any treatment and I'll do the best to facilitate my body's ability to fight it off the best I can and that's not I'm ready you know it's a I've live sixty years\nAnd it's been a good life and um I've experienced a lot of things so you know I'll take the cards that are dealt to me\nBut I Believe deep inside did daddy is probably the best approach to take\nYou know treatment can be pretty devastating and ah I see people all the time goes through that and I'll tell you that the body has an amazing ability or you know just like my my patient in his mid seventies what a turn around\nYou know from somebody who is destined to possibly spend years in a nursing home when he got bad enough and his family could no longer take care of them to to now exercising in and waxing the car\nHow else can you justify some turn around like that but to say there is a higher power at work and our body the ability to heal itself\nAnd I think modern medicine kinda overlooks that too much I think we need to find a way to nurture that instead\nOf trying to be the hero and fix everything ourselves\nSo all the credit goes to my patient as persistence and eating healthier diet and um is is just an amazing thing\nTo do you truly understand the power that's available to each one of us to heal ourselves I doubt it you know I'm In all of this on a daily basis but still there's times when I have you know this little weakness of thought where I Need some kind of a\nI Need my memory rekindled on it so then a patient will come in out of the blue and say hey I've been following what you do what you said and oh man I feel so much better than it's incredible folks it's as if you know there are times when I Need to hear that message the most and that's when it comes\nLife is is an interesting thing is it not\nSo take stock and what you have available to you and help the process by consistently eating the foods that stoke that healing process if you're sick if you're not sick if you have no symptoms right now that doesn't mean you're healthy\nJust means that you don't have this this this easy going on in your body and the symptoms having a reason to the point where you really notice him yet\nBut now is the time to get to work were designed to thrive on fruits vegetables nuts grains seeds berries melons all that good plant based stuff\nThat was put here on earth for us to thrive on\nYou can survive on anything but you know what I'm finding that I enjoyed thriving process much more than just surviving\nI don't like having acid reflux I don't like having you know a stomach that bothers me and I have to find a bathroom somewhere when I go out you know and not because you know my vowels upset or something you know all those things go away when you eat the right foods\nAnd and you find this kind of a you know I don't want to call it a Nirvana or something but it's just a higher state of health that you feel comfortable with\nSo if you don't believe me you need more proof here are a few quotes from the national institutes of health and this comes from the end I H news\nHealth publication titled digging a vegetarian diet\nIf you search and I H or the national institutes of health on line you can subscribe to this publication and receive updates in your email and I have subscribe to it it's great for people who are not medical professionals who don't have medical training because it's written in plain language that everybody can understand\nBut it comes right from the best research and it's it really is powerful research so here's a quote\nMost sickness and so we really need to get a grip on that so\nI'm not saying not celebrate Halloween it's a fun holiday and stuff and I know a lot of people really enjoy that and there's nothing wrong with that I guess uh but you know when your kids come home with a bag full candy throw half of it away when they're not looking you know and uh and save their health be a good thing\nSo another a part of a quote from a this National Institutes of health and or something that I really like from it says\nToday researchers have found that the closure of people are being to vegetarian the lower the risk of diabetes high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome that's\nA condition that raises your risk for heart disease and stroke of a trend is almost like a step bladder with the lowest risk being for strict vegetarian moving up to a lack of vegetarians in the past ... vegetarian so we'll talk about that\nAnd then non vegetarian but I've told you this before the more closely you apply it the better off you'll be I'm Dr ... go we'll be back shortly\n[noise]\n\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid plans in Virginia and hope you get the most from your Medicaid benefits
