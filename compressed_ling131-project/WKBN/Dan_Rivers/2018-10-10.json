weather come and do you see the forecast for the next couple of weeks\nI did and and I tell you I'm I'm really happy with the eighties I'm Glad we've had it as long as we did and I wouldn't complain of fake continued\n[noise] yeah uh that's all going to a kind of end on a\nFriday we're going to get down into the fifties but let's talk a little bit about some current information here and uh that is cyber security\nAnd you're saying a cyber security investment you can make better training and um the uh the scale and complexity of the cyber threatened landscape is revealed talk a little bit about that and why you want to talk about that today\nYou know being one of the things we talk about one of the things we believe in as a company as providing comprehensive risk management for clients for their welfare and their assets so risk management or from our perspective covers a broad spectrum of areas in one of them\nThat we think doesn't get enough attention is cyber security and here's a couple of reasons I wanted to talk about it we had a vendor not too long ago that we interact with that and I'll tell you there's vendor it is owned by an individual who's considered one of the top ten ethical hackers in the country so think about that for a minute there and\nAnd his company was hacked\nUm with with ransomware and it showed his operations down for days and it was a massive undertaking to get his company back up and running\nSo what got us as a company thinking was jeeze if somebody who is listed as one of the top ten ethical hackers in the world gets hacked what does that what does that mean for us and more specifically what does that mean for our clients in their money in their assets\nSo this guy that you're the discovery you're talking about is considered someone that is very secure right that is that when you say um that they have them go on the extra mile to stay out of the line of fire\n... yes that's my point in in the point is we we go on line with such a high degree of trust about just about everywhere we go and we don't really know how we're making ourselves more vulnerable\nUh to to cyber attacks we see it being ... are all the way down to my level when clients were were giving clients access to\nOr their account information online in ... or asking them to help set up what passwords they want and and we often talk about some of the passwords that are used or so overly simplified that we almost considered dangerous\nMhm there is a ... they're going to make it illegal to have a week a password or in other words you that they're going to flag and so you just cannot use it of course a lot of companies are already doing that but you know is is I watch these financial company ... there are so many layers of security that are provided no\nYou I guess maybe I'll rephrase should rephrase that the money movers you know how you take money out of the holiday comes out of the walls of you\nSo typically about six hundred bucks is about all you can get per day\nYeah Adam ATM machines yeah yeah well that that's a good ... to do that but a lot of folks with the debit cards I mean you know you could go to dinner and you can do other things with it so in an ATM withdrawal and a debit withdrawal could be two very different things\nMhm no that's the wild west and we all have to be responsible for it because um if you hang around long enough you'll get ... and uh you know just a couple of tips that I Would give is that read that account every every month make sure that uh you're you're going through that account and making sure that there's nothing\nThat is a strange dead on there because sometimes people just setting you up right they're going they're doing a little trial they've they've stolen a number and they're going to trial and a little bit\nRight that's how that's how they're trying to make sure whether or not they can get away with it so I'm gay and I\nAgain because of what I Do I check my almost every day I check my checking in savings and credit card statements on line almost every day because of that but I Would say at least once a week keep your eye on that in only takes a second to look at it and you'll know firsthand what's going on\nRight and we'll come back we'll tell you about Leo Leo how people get a hold of you if they like to talk with you about investing\nThat can call me at three three o five three three six nine three six where you can email me Leo at ... dot com\nAll right and we'll be back and take a look at the economy and unemployment than all of that stuff and just

sixty eight [noise] and then tomorrow morning showers with a high up Seventy one [noise] ... gets a little\nSnapshot of the economy right now and he changes the juicy here that we should be aware of um in regard to a while the stock market first of all\n[noise] well no I I again I still think that the economic numbers are still strong I I think the employment numbers are proving that out still I think um because of the low in an unemployment rate I think you're going to start seeing more wage pressure\nSo one of the things I'll start keeping my eye out for is that in fact starts becoming an inflationary scenario\nUm but right now you know and I'm thinking in terms of the end of the third quarter going into the fourth or I don't see anything to change my position at this point but again I'm Still watching the fang stocks are and I'm Still watching what their influence our is in terms of market performance overall\nUm because if you look in the last month in the NASDAQ has not had a good month or technology has been\nYou know and everybody seems to be having a job fair there's days\nYeah isn't that nice to see so different than where we were you know seven or eight years ago and there was ten people for every job that was around yeah\nYeah so that's good news or at least a little bit about what you do so folks know exactly who they're talking to here\nWhere we provide professional advice for our clients for there to provide comprehensive risk management for their wealth and their assets that's that's a broad spectrum of what we do and we do that by really getting to know who you are\nWhat it is that really makes you pick a in and try to put the human element together and then from there we put together a plan built around your lifestyle\nVery well and the

ABC News\nAired in rivers jump on this big band wagon we called freedom of speech it's seven to nine nine nine seven seven ring the valley and again there is this\nGreat big experiment we call them Mary\nDo and then [noise]\nAs I get ... Seventy WKBD in you know I just heard that news cast and\nYou did you hear the commercial there from Mike DeWine and they were talking about the oldest sheriffs were saying\nThat if in fact issue one passes we will have the most lenient drug laws in the nation and a issue one has really been roundly criticized in the my initial thought on the entire thing was that you know Richard Cordray\nWas supporting your shoe one but um did you see the latest polls this morning I don't know if it means that much but um they just did a poll\nAnd I forget the I got to think about the credibility of it but there was a thousand voters that were polled and it was one of the polls that you would think about\nAnd apparently this issue is winning by Seventeen percent\nNow that's really surprises me because uh unless we're just in such a vacuum here that we don't understand\nThe larger part of the state of Ohio but if you want to centrally would put more people in drug courts keep people out of jail and the knock on it is that\nYou would be able to possess quite a bit of drugs including ... and not be considered someone that is right for jail so but it's it apparently is winning at least in that poll\nPresident I Am a little surprised but I got an interesting insight into that I was speaking to someone who said that the the regional chamber of commerce a had a meeting with some of the local judges who were opposed to this particular issue one\nAnd the reason being is that it's not what it appears to be\nA ... they're saying the issue was sponsored\nBy outside groups and you'll find that a lot of the advocates who come into chalk it up our from outside of the area\nOf the the the intention what the judges have gleaned from all this is that is not so much to uh to create this new drug court system what these groups are hoping to do is to make it easier\nFor those folks who get caught up in a low level drug offenses make it easier for them to get out of the charge and they're hoping that by sponsoring this particular issue one would attract a lot of those folks who tend to be in that lifestyle to come to the polls now think about where some of those areas\nThere are a lot that we are talking a lot of urban areas I knew a lot about it a folks who may be leaning toward one political party or another or at least toward some of the uh more shall we say progressive ideas out there on the ballot other word is it all teary or motive behind\nSo if you put this in perspective someone that has a million dollars to spend in Ohio to get it on the ballot and maybe ten million dollars for media a that's a good use of old eleven million dollars I'm just using a figure that they can go out and say we can get this much\nMore voting power that they're trying to be more power exactly they're trying to attract a certain clientele to the polls normally gonna might not vote and hoping that they've all over altogether causes that they're looking\nFor about that how 'bout that they're there you go but anyway you'd be surprised that there seems to be winning\nAnd I'm almost everybody that I talked to thinks that's a bad idea\nUm most of the law enforcement even the local judges have said you know that this is not a good idea to allow people to possess large amounts and wouldn't large as a relative term I get that I'm not quantifying it I'm just saying enough ... and you don't need much spent all do a lot of damage right and you would not go to jail for that\nSo that's what we have\nSo they say that it is winning by Seventeen boys and we have more fans walking by here who\nAre phones are seven to nine nine nine seven seven and a will fill the lines up here and then we'll go to our phone calls and\nYou can talk about anything you want um\nSeven to nine nine nine seven seven that is our phone number all you do is just ring that\nNumber and I'm Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton did you hear what Hillary said\nHillary said and this is the quote that is going around the nation the shot heard round the world you cannot leave civil with Republicans\n... is the quote yep you cannot be civil with Republicans she says civility can start again if the Democrats win back the U.S Senate in the house of representatives or both come November So that's the only way you can be civil so\nI assume if you're reading into this she's saying that you can't give them any quarter you can't talk to them\nYou can't negotiate with them\nBecause they are not to be ... ... talk through civil a so if you're not civil that means that you're angry with them right and that you call names you you do whatever you can you do what they were doing in Portland\nWhite haired guy driving through Portland people in masks running them off the running him out of town get outta here you white guy\nAmazing it this is in is in usually it's white people saying that to them to\nDo and so Hillary Clinton is inciting people to be uncivil in other words to be nasty and to be a a ... is actually in some cases break the law yeah just to get public ... out of power and of\nHave the kind of problems that we have in a place like turkey were a reporter walks into the Saudi um he he he walks into the Saudi embassy and he goes in to get divorce papers and he's been a critic of the Saudi Arabian government he never comes back out um folks\nI you you may think we're a long way from that but\nIf this is going around the world and these are the kinds of things that these liberals that are marching in the streets with their masks on heading a bind to watch what you got an election coming up here in thirty days you better be at the polls absolutely you better be at the polls because this thing could all change on a\nDime the end of Donald Trump being able to bring this country back to any segment do any sense of um what we hoped it will be under him hey here's Hillary Clinton she she's not done folks she's taking some time off\nAnd her quote you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nAnd what you care about\nWhat is that\nWhat is being destroyed I I don't get it hard bike I'm just going to take the best call here I Know we're not not screening but what's your feeling for the best call let's go good morning you're on five Seventy WKBD end the wildcard Wednesday you are first on the air\nOkay thank you I just wanted to

traced back up here I I think maybe we just have to throw your hands up and say we have lost this\nBecause I Can't wave a magic wand and have Danny ... hill executed\nBut if you're looking at Danny Lee and I I I could just take the how I truly feel from what you've just said yes uh he doesn't deserve to draw in other breath after doing the heinous things that you just talked about\nBut again where are we going with this are we getting anywhere maybe it's just time to let the guy die of old age in prison\n[noise] I don't know are you getting anywhere ... with what we're doing\nApparently we need to take a little bit of the laws that Texas has like you say I'm not a big guy not a big death penalty guy but I go back in precisely for the reasons that you just stayed\nWith the way we feel here in the United states about executing people we just are not able to get it done\nWe are not able to prove to people that someone needs to leave this earth after the things that you said who would disagree that this guy deserves to have any semblance of life\nAnd you know what he's probably had a pretty poor life too if he has been in prison and all this time but we're not getting it that we are not\nNot executing people I agree with you\nI understand and I remember the I've been around long enough to remember this and I remember what Miriam life has gone through and how this most hurt

DVD I mean pretty much stay stable um after you get it on that right\nIt actually it improves the quality a little bit doesn't cause if you're looking at it on a cleaner technology as opposed to a tape spinning around a wheel that's getting dirty and so on and you know ... you're not going to turn it into our production but it looks a little bit better\nYeah how about the some of the last video because when I used to work at a television station they had these big reels they were about three inches and uh I'll bet those machines don't even exist any longer if you can transfer those you\nCan't remember you're well you remember that it could have was so thick every every company has three quarter inch video in every school had half an inch a old film all of that equipment is gone I don't know what happened to it but it's gone\nNow I Know you think about all these people that sell that stuff um I I I just look at our own industry I mean you know we get something in that um you know as the flavor of the day and then the next thing you know it's in the bone yard\nYeah yeah I'll tell you that cost like a costly crazy lady just brought in fist Eighteen reveals a three inch reels of old films you ones that put it on\nDVD all Eighteen boxers were empty there was no hope\nThere do you got it and there's nothing in there I'd never opened the box where there's disappointment that's something you know somebody had to take it and slice it on to bigger real old and I can't get it it's like I should have looked at the box is once you're an open the boxes when she wrote them and that was a surprise you know what was the um what was the format\nThat people had back in the sixties was it called ... millimeter was that\nNone of them yes you know you ain't no one is sixteen millimeter sixteen dollars is what you're out in the school remember the actors\nBut the the the people that are your neighborhood that may have had a movie camera back then it was that would've been eaten elevator does it have to get that developed the dude and they\nThey and then they yeah you have to take a drug store and they got it back in and it was a three inch we're out in the three inch real is only three minute song that's why I was placed it on to bigger up but then you got into a you had a a well as a super ... uh some of it had an audio but most of the ...\nDid you ever have a camera where you had to take the ... and screw tournament absolutely and then you take a picture and then you had to change my mom and bring your hand you burn your fingers when you pop that yeah you said there's some people out there will never experienced it they'll never experienced a probably a lot of it will never experienced pulling a lucky strike out of your mouth and the tobacco in the fire getting caught on your fingertips\n[laughter] they'll probably never experience let me take you back a lot further you when they used to the studio photographer members like I used to hold the flash thing\nOkay oh yeah he's holding an entertainment and he's looking under the thing and he's looking upside down for him now when you look at those old photos when you had either animals dogs or cats or whatever and young children they were always Marie ... because he would pop the lens open for six seconds and then wait for the fire and everybody was just frozen steps not smiling yeah\nAnd the kids or young children or the animals were moving they were always worry\nYou imagine the um the event that it would be to take a picture of some ... looking people and you you've got the guy over here with a camera on the tripod and then somehow is what triggered the flash that someone else was holding up ... or ...\nOh yeah no you get some really neat pictures you know in photography was invented and they'll just ... or for Wenatchee\nEighteen twenty seven in France by the civil war they got really good with black and white okay and they were printed on glass they would print on ten friends die on paper or whatever that they were already experiment but that's why you see a lot of civil war photographers it's still pretty good shape\nOkay so there was a pretty good technique bank then oh yeah they were planning on anything that would work can you still go down to the store and buy a roll of thirty five millimeter film no\nYou cannot there's probably three stars in the state of Ohio that have those right now you cannot go to the drugstore and rice film you cannot go to the drugstore and have a developing\nBut you know the people that are covering the press so you know for newspapers and stuff like this they're still using I'm a high quality camera and you hear their shutters clicking right that's not on film that's on a digital digital solved digital so you really I Wonder if you can go buy a VHS tape maybe you can maybe the gas station regular you maybe ought to Petro\nE bay is the only place you're going to find any of that really you cannot find a blank videotape a unit itself you can't find them\nYou can't find that you can't find the videotape to go into even a thirty five millimeter film which uh you know I was so proud of had this petri is seven s which took a lot of thirty five millimeter um pictures in in the military and uh it's junk\nI just transferred about six hundred and slides a it was both thirty five millimeter and and there was one what you call one town it's a little smaller a lot of it was Vietnam you know there are pictures of you know broken ... sandbags everywhere\nAnd now I imagine anybody that has in any of the Gulf War
