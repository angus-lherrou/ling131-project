know there's there's just things working where you don't think about them so often\nAnd I I just picked this up this morning I never gave us a thought but for those of you who eat out or what they say that many restaurants leave the salt and pepper shakers on the table all the time you know we're used to seeing it\nBut how often do those things really get clean\nThat you hope that people that are having dinner or lunch at wash their hands or use something but they say most salt and pepper shakers are only white down and if they're dirty and even then only with the damp cloth that busters keeping their pockets\nYou think about where things are lurking right gee buddy Christmas I'd I'd never thought about this at all I mean you you hear about some of the things that uh you know you come you fight oh well I go to a hotel room and I sit on the bed and a lot of people have sat there and people are very careful about that of course that's pretty obvious but\nSalt and pepper shakers I didn't I didn't think about that at all they see their rarely properly emptied sanitized breezy\nAll right so maybe some folks out there that have restaurants now will say you know that's a good idea well so let's make sure that we take care of that [noise]\nAll right I'm In reverse on five Seventy W key before we get started I Want to tell you a little story here about a Bob and Janet a Bob ... another one of our Kelly stories\nThey had a five bedroom home\nAnd they had a few acres in Poland and they were anxious to move into something a little bit smaller I guess so five bedrooms that's a big place up while they heard about Kelly warrant and her team's cutting edge marketing they met with a couple\nThey designed a specific plan for the home and then they engage their marketing machine with you know the great pictures the detailed pictures you know like Kelly likes to do\nThey ... they generate so much demand that within a few hours of the sign\nBeing posted the phone started ringing and that whole got multiple showing the first day and it's sold for over asking price in less than twenty four hours\nNow that may not be your experience but they also accepted all full price backup offer but they didn't need it may Kelly your first call some things never change right she guarantees to sell your whole with no risk at a price in date that you agree to\nIf I were selling my home I Would make that one called it's one thing I wouldn't have to worry about I just called Kelly Kelly would take care of it because she would tell me pretty much to the penny what the whole was worth and how much you can get for it that is what Kelly does she gets things done\nIn the last couple of weeks I mean it is really been suspect and then\nRemember the guy that we got from Detroit and he got\nThe blood disease and he had to go out for the season I think that that may have been the turning point\nWhen he when he came in he was hitting and he was doing very well and then they decided to do we're going to just set him up for the rest of the season because it's a very serious disease he's lucky and there was life threatening tell you the truth but it's been kinda downhill since then\nAnd that they've tried out a few players but they just never really been able to get the uh the hitting going save for a\nWheel or young smile Baker they call and smile and our shortstop ... he always shows up he is a future future start but we'll put them away until you know not very long from now right now of the buses will be leaving for result again in February and Indian season is done\nUm but it was a good ride and again the Indians do show up and they give us every year it good run toward the pet it this year it ended with a three games sweep by the Houston Astros\nOh wait

K. via Britain\nTime is not a blonde and Jews ... brother is fine art with John Lynette ... brothers dot com these news radio five Seventy shovel you have a young child\nSherry pressed in hurricane Michael Dell up to a category to storm as it's been to the Gulf of Mexico Florida governor Rick Scott warning McCain\nThey're going to have those tropical storm force winds thirty five to forty miles an hour in places that are already rain soaked between Georgia and what we've already seen the devastation that haven't from Florence in South Carolina\nAnd North Carolina uh that that drenched grounds are going to uproot trees it's going to knock over power lines for places that are still trying to get back on line to a certain extent so\nUh those winds at least at this point could be dangerous heading out that direction before it hits the Atlantic\nSo folks that are in Panama City in areas like evolution of cola or are they in order to get out do they do they how is it mandatory back evacuation\nAt this point the only mandatory evacuation I could pinpoint and find out for sure what the people near Panama City beach so ah Panama City Panama City beach parts of bay county right there are a hundred and twenty thousand people had been under mandatory evacuation from their\nUh Florida governor Rick Scott has called for a state of emergency and thirty five counties kind of surrounding that area and if you kind of go back to uh\nAs far up I think is Pensacola I think was one of the ... when you're talking about this the storm surge is the most deadly part right and that's what we know are having seen in Florence here when you're looking at the storm surge it'll go from Pensacola all the way down into the the uh the curve there in Florida just south of of ah Panama City\nAnd all of that is supposed to be storms or just directly south of Panama City like south east\nIs where the highlight and the top of the storm surge is supposed to be with the possibility of twelve foot storm surge so you're looking at a storm surge of twelve feet that's where the top of the water is that's above a single story home and then the waves on top of that so\nThere will be danger all the way up to Pensacola and down a little bit further south and then Panama City there everybody in those areas right now are part of that state of emergency warning\nAnd I guess the other question Michael has this been built to withstand a storm like this along the beach I'm sure but inland probably not\n[laughter] yeah that's that's going to be a big telling portion of this I I was speaking with somebody earlier who had recently been to the area not ... not ... not the animosity directed but in the area there and gone to a small like camping resort place and they were just got finished rebuilding from one of the last ones that came through there and now this is going to be heading so\nYeah I think inland that's where you're going to have depending on what kind of force winds we get when this thing hits if it continues to build his work expecting it to\nThen it could come in with hundred thirty hundred fifty mile an hour winds if it kinda backs off of that you're down to the one twenties maybe even into the teens on some level that's good news we'd like to have that more so if we can keep it down there is any way to get that went down fantastic if it stays up there then you're going to see a lot more trouble further inland\nBut essentially we're talking the effects of this is going to be really from Houston or even\nRaleigh and all of the city's Memphis co yeah they're all going to be affected with a lot of rain aren't they\nThe only thing that's kind of holding that off and going any further north is the cold front that's kind of sitting or will be sitting right over kind of where a Birmingham into Atlanta like just\nThe Atlanta seems to be one of the markers or this during the cold front north of Atlanta and including Atlanta will be kind of keeping this hurricane out of its path so that's what keeps this this work in tropical storm when it goes inland off of that beating pat and kind of shoots it out the Carolinas but yeah you're talking about\nEverything in the wake is going to get some form of rain when a flooding from this all because as you're looking at that storm surge coming in that's going to affect the way other areas in regards to Florida when you get up and to Alabama when you start to scoop out into Louisiana even going to start to see what some of that storm surges affecting those areas\nMichael final question here a win and a is there any storm indication right now is anybody feeling anything like this right now and when is this going to hit with all its fear\nThe only people that have been getting hit so far or are people in Cuba that have been dealing with a good portion of the when the wind in the rain but this is expected to this is this is one of the more interesting fact about this to Dan is that the governor Rick Scott pointed out wherever you lay your head tonight on the pillow to go to sleep\nPretty much plan on staying there until this thing is all said and done so if you make your way out and you're able to evacuate good for you but today is really the last day to evacuate expecting this to hit eight am tomorrow morning or right around there\nA Wednesday morning in Panama City and then kind of make its way in by the afternoon a and and maybe the eye of the storm crosses Panama City late in the afternoon at some point but then starts to make its way towards Georgia and shooting up to the Carolinas\nOr Michael we'll check back with you tomorrow I appreciate you being on you got to have a great rest your morning\nThank you for men BBC Radio news Michael power on five Seventy WKBD in

are now in favor of legalization\nAnd here we are in pretty much of a conservative state I'm In nearby Michigan they are making that decision coming up in November ... where would you be on this they're fighting to sixty two percent of Americans are now in favor of uh so you know you if you're against it you're a shrinking mine very fast\nI'm according to Pew there's only about thirty eight

Hispanics are opposed to legalization than favorite fifty percent the forty eight sixty nine percent of Democrats are in favor of legalization more Republicans are opposed and supported Republicans fifty one to forty five still\nOpposing legalization [noise] so where do you stand on this um let me just quote something here from a port Huron newspaper in their editorial section they said\n\nMost forecasters expect a majority of voters to say yes\nIn Michigan on November first what do you think about that city in Michigan is a border state now folks\nThat if in fact you really want to go on a vacation to Michigan you're going up to the Henry Ford museum well maybe you go up there for a pot break it's or you don't have to you and people used to go up there to gamble a now you can do that at home but now you can go up to Michigan\nI'm Eric Luper he says\nHe wish voters would stop to think about the consequences first and that was kind of interesting what he said some of the just the quote a couple of things he said as the president of the citizens Research Council of Michigan\nWere non partisan and we work to improve Michigan government since Nineteen sixteen the citizens research does not take positions on ballot issues but it does warn that proposal one\nWill not be free and I'm paraphrasing some of the things he said\nHe said to propose a one is couched in individual liberty Michigan voters also should consider the social consequences of this proposal\nAnd he goes on to say like alcohol in like tobacco greater accessibility to marijuana will create new costs for public safety you're going to have more cost for criminal justice public health and mental health and he says if this proposal passes Michigan\nWould become now the Penn State to legalize recreational use of marijuana the state likes it because they're going to collect six percent sales tax they're also going to enforce a ten percent excise\nTax some estimates\nThey say the annual tax revenues will be at a hundred and thirty five million dollars\nAnd he says the first problem with the estimate is that as other states now no pot sellers and buyers have no compunction about operating outside the law was sixteen percent tax bite means underground sales will continue that mean that just makes sense doesn't mean that just makes sense\nThat if you're putting a sixteen percent tax on the government and smoking pot and buying the pot there's going to be a whole lot of people out there that are still going to go with the underground sales\nSo that's just one thing you're charging sixteen percent you're trying to make money on this but people who would undercut you so you're still going to be chasing down the illegal marijuana\nAnd then he goes on to say ... none of the hundred and thirty five million dollars is earmarked for dealing with the problems he says you'll have increased mental health problems a lot of people you love you would argue with that and say you would not [noise] but then of course we know that if children get a hold of it that um it can affect their brains as they're developing\nAnd of course you know you have the possibility of automobile accidents and just as you do with alcohol and he says as seen what the sensible medical marijuana the marijuana black market will persist with all its negative effects including the robberies that kidnapped the murderers\nAnd he says the money will go into the state's general fund along with savings from the department of corrections law enforcement of the courts the number of annual arrests for marijuana possession exceeds those for all violent crimes combined [noise]\nSo we've laughed about it what we've even something about it right we really have basically\nI always heard that is or was tops yeah [laughter] I couldn't go there and it has become something that is so acceptable in most circles Willie most performers most youngsters they think it is harmless\nOh I watch surgeries I'm not saying the marijuana cause I'm just saying those were the facts and and the final thing I'll say about it and I don't think it should be legal the final thing I'll say is this also folks that are able body and that work and choose not to work and\nIf they test positive for marijuana use two things should happen they either shit lose their benefits for they should take mandated treatment and they test positive again they should lose those benefits and that's my ah talk for the morning no\nI I hear what you're saying is that uh you know we don't really test people that are getting benefits and\nI truly believe that marijuana probably kills their initiative to I mean I you know I don't have a record I don't have it but I mean I saw evidence of that when I was in Vietnam the people that smoke pot all the time they really didn't have a lot of ambition to me\nThat you know basically that's what they did when I was in um\nA lot of people that smoke pot that was their life\nJust one of the one of those things so my personal experience that I think it does kill initiative you know here we go again in this country um we continue to find a way to escape reality ... I mean you know alcohol is bad enough we've got all the enough of that probably already\nHas a nurse if I'm ever as a nurse when I worked I never drank when I and I have a beer every night or a glass of wine or I Will I have one drink before I go to bed\nDone it for years I never went to a restaurant never went out never visited and had a drink I'm so that when I was driving my car if I was stopped and ... you know tested for any reason I Would test positive that's an automatic\nUm I'm not ... my license so it's not the same is alcohol and and don't equate it as the same thing as alcohol the drug problem is much worse than the alcoholism problem in this country they're both problems but there's a great discrepancy between the two\nYou know I mean you just made that very clear um if you're going to go out and use a high caliber of marijuana\nAnd then drive you are going to be the equivalent being drunk right I mean I Would think the thing and would be like going out you can\nAnd I don't advocate it you can go out and you can have one drink with a meal and probably be safe again I don't advocate it but you can and that's where we are thank you for your call it's five Seventy W ... gets us continue that we've talked about capital\nTo so much let's continue this conversation on the other side of this\n\nVote is now and risk Kavanaugh is confirmed keeping for\nThis is just the beginning keeping gauge to those who\nUse radio five Seventy\nWKBD in Cody cigar box sunny and eighty four tomorrow partly sunny eighty two Thursday rain in sixty nine right now Seventy two we're talking about we'd here's David ... field\nId ... good morning and do your thoughts please [noise]\nSo I don't think this is going to end up like the casino thing where were the\nLast you know ten percent of states legalize it\nDutch and\nThen we end up doing it anyway and we end up missing out on you know ten Twenty years of ...\nOn the upside of it OK in\nThere I mean we have out here and can't do schools are older than me I mean we could put this money to good use and all these people are saying you know people are going to drive with it they are doing it now\nAnd yeah you know that's the only under a minute of it but it ... that's ... you know what\nDavid if they are driving with it why aren't we hearing more about an intoxicated marijuana driver I ... I Can't recall can you anybody that was charged for marijuana use in an accident\nI I'm going to be completely honest with you I've never smoked marijuana in my life but I've had friends that have done it I've gotten into a car with a guy that was just smoked marijuana you drove better than he drove when he was sober [laughter] I don't know why\nIt just happened that way though he was doing the speed limit he was you know it doesn't have the same effect as I'll call it I don't think that you know that's a big deal but she got like that last guys people at these misdemeanor\nDrug charges on their record that can't get jobs because they come up on a background check and ... and employers won't even look at him because\nYou know if you could treat it like you do here I mean I'd probably be down with it you know in other words\nIf you could have a beer like the last caller says he has a beer before I'm dead last night and then he can go to work without being drug tested beer [noise] um I think that'd probably be the way to do so we now you got a little youngster in a car huh\nYeah her generation will definitely legalize it ... I don't think there's any doubt about that\nI'm going to let you take her I'd appreciate your check check anyone's man that you liked by somebody WKBD it now you're going to get another half an hour this if you want it or not you know the\nWay to find out who am I don't knock it do you tried it will not in my brain\nAnd I'll never smoke we were really\n[laughter]\nI learned the hard line in a small town\nFired up a bad mood and he passed him around\nIn the last word boom before they meet him\n[laughter] I'll never smoke we were when they found the mold we with women and minorities\nWill continue this is a few minutes ten oh six back here Filipinos up we'll talk it out for half an hour\nTime is ten o'clock Sean ... brothers can be deterring fine hard was deemed\nRadio five seven\nI'm hearing from an evacuation orders are in effect now for parts of Florida's Gulf Coast with hurricane Michael powering up ABC's peak combs is in Panama City beach\nMy phone number real quick seven to nine nine nine seven seven seven to nine nine nine seven seven and a when I'm seeking to understand Joe says that before he goes to bed at night either has a glass of wine a high ball or a beer and he's done that for years\nNow if in fact you were to go out and let's say you were doing that at a restaurant and you're going to have that same beer and you're going to have that marijuana hit is that the same you're going to get back and you're going to drive an attack or\nHour later how does that affect you I bring this up too because the correlation between this is the\nEditorial in the port urine times is also an article by the way it's reprinted the Tribune's where I got it um pure research now says that sixty two percent of us are now in the favor of legalization sixty two percent about that\nSo if you were in the minority and they say the people out there that are in the minority there are now calling you the silent generation of other words it's not bad enough that they call you old they are now calling you the silent generation so people that are Seventy plus that silent generation out there\nYou're the people that are against it All right those are filling up we'll start in ... to Beulah on five Seventy W gave me an All right ... your experience and what do you what have you learned\n[noise] well I'm going for our life so I Know a lot but I never tried it but I Know a large business to me what you learn when you when you start going through\nAll the [noise] the rules and regulations it is it that basically it's it's controlled by far my all the diseases\nThat no pharmaceutical cure that they're you're allowed to use marijuana for\nFirst thing you look at is there's no there's no cure for aids really Crohn's disease or any kind of chronic ... and ... ... and stuff they'll be a a seizures Alzheimer's\nSo gentlemen to see this back to you know there's a lot of diseases or there's no answer to them\nAnd that's what they allow to be treated for but these are these are great if you get the right strain\nLike if you have low THC or G. H. ca ... uh then you can treat migraines with a beautifully instead of taking a you know the the high powered drugs that they contain opiates mhm\nSo anybody that has migraines you you just get a low T H see it in a sucker for a meal ticket a little bit you wait you know ten Fifteen minutes or something like that see how it affects you the key in this whole thing is dosage of medical marijuana\nVaping vaping and and and hard candies that you could you know you can just click and put back is the way to go for this type of thing\nBut you know people don't understand marijuana marijuana has no psychoactive properties at all until you heated up past like two hundred and twenty degrees than the T. A. C. A. the acid part of the marijuana drops out\nAnd it becomes THC\nYou can eat this stuff all day long and you'll never get high until you do have box elated once you ... then you get you get the psychoactive properties\nMy wait a minute when what does that mean the the de corps what I'd never heard that word\n... when you bring your marijuana past the temperature of two hundred and twenty degrees for X amount of time the a drops out the acid in the marijuana drops out and and becomes now psychoactive\nYeah but now wait a minute we've had people that have said that they have a a least people's cookies brownies and stuff like that oh no way\nYou when you cook a brownie you bring it up as doing all the great\nOK okay so now when you release threatened you've really says okay\nYou released it and and this is the key to the whole thing I mean it's it's a time will change it to but\nYou know home growing is probably the best thing for people to do that that have a you know they have the capability to do it you can grow it in ten and growing at home and go three or four plants but nothing\nThis is a money grab after you find out what's really going on it cost just three thousand square feet of cost you probably between a half a million and a million dollars to set up your your your ah your grow facility\nMhm it is not ... it's ... and and I believe me I talked to all these people all around the country Colorado whoever and and it's the same thing prices are dropping like crazy in these places they used to be like four hundred dollars other eighty bucks a pile of eighty bucks an hour or\nSo and so you're doing is also that the testing labs I'm Sorry taco you\nKnow that's a good testing labs are cheating see anything lower than twenty percent ... your stuff is not going to sell to the processors for for making ... and stuff like that okay\nYou're talking about you're talking about the toxicity of it or if it's less than twenty percent or affective you mean\nYeah the THC hey you know if if it's less than twenty percent you're crop is is not going to be as good as it was so\nWhat am I on somebody ... let me ask you a couple of questions here because I didn't go too much in depth of this but um if you're just out in growing marijuana is that going to satisfy the recreational user if Ohio would simply say you know what you folks out there are treated like you're making beer if you want to go out and grow a plant\nIs that going to be good enough for some for most people\nYes you can ... a six plants will give you about two and a half pounds\nOkay okay that's enough for a whole year or more that's\nEnough for a whole year few dry it and you treat it properly and and you know air it out and you know getting mold or anything and also\nYou know the growing it is a little bit of an art but if you have a tent you keep your spider mites and keeping diseases and keep your temperature control it probably costs that set up probably costs you about seven hundred dollars but the fans and the lights and everything\nBut you make a point that the the states are looking to make money off of this though\n[laughter] you know you know I'm I like the apple does really quick we wouldn't make four hundred and sixty two thousand dollars every four weeks\n[laughter] if you go to license\nIf you've got to license that's why and by the way every one of the license almost every one of them they're owned by outside concerns\nBecause in order to do this you have to have so much experience in this program it's unbelievable I mean you have to have twenty four seven surveillance P. C. D. cameras I\nThink you would not believe key cards for every room for the vegetation and the bloom and then the drying rooms and and the cloning rooms\nBut the one that you started off with it and you're an interesting guy but you're saying that this does have an effect for non curable diseases are diseases that you simply have to maintain them and you're saying that if in fact you're trying to make somebody feel better when they have ... disease or the migraine headaches this is a good effective treatment\nWell absolutely it's especially migraine headaches it it it it takes the strain away the stress\nAway from the migraine hey relieves the addict kicked down the pain and then it it it allows the migraine headaches than than either not go there more to diminished\nOr dramatically too quick ... did you get your license or are you still buying for one here no we\nCouldn't we couldn't get it I mean it was just too that they have a ... a a rating program and we didn't have the out of state help these people have\nYou know do you have any opinion on the first question I asked if in fact you set up and somebody took a strong screen of marijuana in a beer and drove within the hour we'll do you do you have any research on that on how they would be affected\n[noise] no and and you shouldn't a mix two of them together that I Know I mean one one one kind of accelerates the other one yeah and you you either going to take a you know either going to vape and stay at home ...\n... one of the worst things there is but it it it probably is a gel narco hall two hundred proof is probably the cure for cancer because alcohol kills cancer one hundred percent\nIn in in in liver and everything else you just have to have it in the ... and they're just starting that they just figured it out that you put methods cellulose in there and it\nAnd it binds the alcohol into a gel and you shoot it into the cancer and it kills it one hundred percent a problem is Dan it costs five dollars\nAnd it's just not worth it or not just\nNot worth it I ... down in Cleveland Clinic there using alcohol a blazing down there but he was in a liquefied which means it migrate to the other cellular structures around there and\nKills them the healthy cells Michael ... well that's not\nWhat the heck do you do or you just a researcher are you a doctor or what do you what\nI Do I read a tremendous amount of medical journals and yes I'm kind of that but ... my my my job is is is you know to stay healthy do do you do to increase the knowledge for other people but there are so many things out there\nThat are that are jokes but I Know one thing that always comes down to now it's it's diet and exercise is nutrition and exercise is the only thing that's going to keep your bought alive and your dad and I and and that's really it when it comes out to your food will give you everything you need\nIf you have a little bit of problems marijuana is just a plant it's harmless plant until you just smoke it done it beamed\nAnd bought the CDs are very helpful by all the research I've done the CDs are very helpful for information information and what is what kills a human being just like a doctor that go inflammation is the key\nIf you keep that down and your body very seldom you ever get sick\nAnd how how how that they don't you read the ...\nAnd it's it's really a set up for the pharmaceutical industry\nYou know you got to have my calling you and your interesting guy thank you very much Richard says that he has an analogy between the weed and the beer in the driving Richard Doug go ahead and expound on that\nVery nice All right and you know you have a show room where you can come and sit down with the folks that look it's on the southern boulevard pat give us

Pennsylvania Tom go ahead please you've got a minute and a half [noise] yeah I uh I smoke pot for a long time\nDrank smoked pot or I Do I ever got was when I was doing both of them together and uh the problem with marijuana it affects everybody differently and uh\nI mean I've smoked pot why couldn't even for your whole my feet touch the petals or my car\nOkay that's a myth that due to smoking\nPot not drinking anyway but when you drink with pot it takes the edge off the pot but it also makes you a lot higher you know and and you know\nDefinitely not in control your ... or reading or you know able to drive\nYou know not that you have to be the final arbiter on this subject but if you're saying that you have smoked marijuana and then you got into a car and you couldn't feel your feet you obviously couldn't be very good at driving\nI was pretty good dry dry for what reason but the uh\nThe problem is that every grade marijuana and I was should I remember that marijuana I smoked and cat when I was what really can't recall the Panama and it was the strongest marijuana I've ever smoked\nAnd I could not feel the animals in the car and a person writing with me senator you are right kept asking me you're okay I I Can't even\nI feel my feet touching the battles a\nStick shift at that time like VW and you know it strongly dangerous\nYeah All right thanks for your testimony and of course it doesn't have to be the final word on it but it's the final word on a more this morning 'cause I'm moving on to another topic\nHere and then the topic of a hurricane bearing down on us and people are talking about climate change will tackle that topic in a moment Nikki Haley has resigned also president of the end [noise]\n\nRadio five Seventy W. K. be an age ten thirty\n[noise]\nMorning here's what's happening in the valley young dumb police and fire recalled out this morning to the three hundred block of Avondale avenue\nBecause of her record as both shots fired and someone trying to send a house on fire and where did people do live in the house all\nThe case of arson overnight and Simon boardman late last night boardman police and

over on the east side of Youngstown one of the drivers now facing all vi charges\nAnd twenty year old ... brown also was charged with driving without a valid license\nAustin police have used the anti overdose drug knocks on a lot of times now they can actually say they use it to save a dog's life workers at a vet clinic had given a dog in opioid as an anesthetic for surgery the dog and a bad reaction so often Tom police were called and they gave the dog a dose of ... the dog is doing just fine\nFrom the power Chevrolet Buick GMC of Calcutta, Ohio newsroom I'm Tom for\nThree three three one side and we would make\n\nWill get remarks from the president here on Nikki Haley's resignation that'll be coming out shortly but meanwhile we have our men for all seasons on the line here bills emperor on five Seventy W key beyond your morning bill and ask them on it we'll see if we can turn on a dime here and talk about UN ambassador Nikki Haley\nThe resignation of a person pretty familiar with Donald Trump\nSaid that this was coming down and uh she had a a a pretty good run here of two years you think is just the news just enough as it gets what's what's going on\nOr I'm not sure I mean this to me is a shocker uh because uh ... it is strange timing for this just a little bit before\nThe mid term election uh and the ... and at a time when it was just a short time ago that Nikki Haley or wrote a rebuttal to that are anonymous op ed in the New York times where she\nWas squarely behind the Trump Administration\nAnd sounded like she was going to be a long time or are there ah with with the Trump Administration so this is really a strange timing to me and it came out of nowhere supposedly other reports are that are she told her staff about it just this morning so nobody knew about it and this came out of the blue\nThen we're going to go to the BBC Radio stand by you got it oh he'll send by over we're not going to see it All right let me know heck no go ahead bill so\nYeah yeah so to me it's a shocker and she is someone who has been for the most part a a right with the Trump Administration and their policy spheres deferred on a few things with them but\nIt's not a situation where there were clashes like there were maybe with Rex Tillerson or\nSome other cabinet members who had run ins with the president and just didn't get along with them\nA ... it seemed like they weren't for the most part on the same page and Nikki Haley as you and and bass and it was kind of removed from the day in day out a drama that might take place in the oval office because he was in New York based in New York and I'm not at the White House every day so\nShe may have had the best of both worlds there being part of the administration but not having to deal with the every day drama or of being in the west wing every day so rather interesting to me Dan and I I'm I Can't wait to hear what they have to say this morning\nNoon will have a coming up we'll when it happens but bill um I don't know how much time you have you have a couple of minutes you're yeah sure um I just wanted to see one of the things that seems to be kind of the\nThe way things work now is that you're in there for a short time and you're out and you move on because the jobs are so demanding like you said with her she almost seems like a mini me with Donald Trump because she would go out and give them hell Harry right at the un sure into she would really\nEcho whatever Donald Trump said I Know what you're saying that something happened\nYeah uh this is what we don't know a ... and the fact that uh she is going to be holding a joint news conference with the president this morning it leads you to believe that they are ... she is partying on good terms\nUh ... when she was named UN ambassador it was thought that maybe she had some aspirations for higher office now but still the time if that's the case that timing would be very strange here or that she would resign right now a ... you know the other part of their says that\nAh you know Nikki Haley and initially uh was thought there was speculation that maybe she was the one that wrote the anonymous op ed that appeared in New York Times until she came out with a rebuttal for it so I I you know this to me is very this is the head spin or this is very confusing\nAs I look at Dickie Haley too you know sometimes I think I don't know if we had the confidence that she could lead a the UN the United states' position on the un when she had been a governor you kind of looked and said well you know we're we're just coming from but she turned out to be pretty capable hasn't gee\nI thought so I you know I I I like you said she did a great job of getting across the Trump Administration policy in the UN and and for the most part was right behind it now she on her own has kinda lashed out at other countries on human rights abuses something that President Trump has been unwilling to do\nThat she has done that as well now\nUh you would think that this is someone who was a governor who are a lot of times a a governor might seek higher office now she has foreign policy experience uh where where do we go from here\nThe only other thing is that uh if there had been some speculation as well in the past that she may end up being secretary of state in this administration but that's not now open with with my palm pales solidly there and he has a favorite of President Trump a again a lot of questions remain to be answered\nRight now she is actually the daughter of immigrants right from India and um she basically had risen to this position here I'm Out of out of a stage remembered that the one thing that she did she had a battle against the Confederate flag remembering twenty Fifteen oh yeah that's right yeah\nAnd then she was the governor when they had the massacre at the black church in Charleston yes so she has had a lot of history with domestic issues that's why it was so surprised when she was so capable of what she has done here at the un in fact uh when she spoke at the un\nShe really would lambaste Peter that we're always doing everything that the United states was for\nAbsolutely uh she didn't hold back in any of her comments at the un\nAnd and I thought she did a very good job as the ambassador uh to the un from the United states and and and I did two things number one got out of the criticisms of other countries and also followed policies of the Trump Administration so\nType very aware and we'll just leave it at that will leave it at that and see where we go here from there but it has been a monumental day here because you've got the president everybody is standing by with bated breath to find out why Nikki Haley is resigning\nA you know someone that has really been someone that has really carry the water for Donald Trump and bays basically when she goes to the un she doesn't take any prisoners and she lets go my first thought was okay maybe Nikki Haley has had it two years of this stuff in your out there every day you're working long hours and\nYou want to get back to your family maybe that is it's no more complex complex than that\nIn that she has said you know what enough I'm going to get out of this and but maybe there is some kind of a ruffling of the feathers between she and president Donald Trump but um you know what I'd go back and we say we look into everything\nBut is it possible that you've just got\nEnough you you just can't take it in ... in fact I sometimes wonder how people continue to do do this work Nikki Haley resigning from this position is probably one that maybe she wants to go back and get back to her family\nThey say that the U.S president Donald Trump is expected Nikki excepted Nikki Haley's resignation as you ambassador to the United nations and the timing of her departure is a pretty much unclear right now a Trump said on Twitter that he would make a big announcement\nWith his friend ambassador Haley in the oval office at ten thirty she got to get another um if you're going to get another job\nA Haley was appointed to the un post November twenty sixteen and before she was named by Trump to the un post she was the governor of South Carolina and Nikki Haley uh Indian ancestry first woman to hold the post of the un\nAnd she was kind of a rookie to international politics that's why I was wondering about Nikki Haley as a as a uh but as I watched her more and more I realize Nikki Haley she knew what she was doing she went in and she told the un hey\nThis whole thing of us sitting around here and having a stiff upper lip while you get back and criticize everything we do it's not going to go us paying the free for all of the nation's that's not going to work any longer we're going to expect you to pony up we're not going to be uncle sugar anymore\nUm but if you go back to South Carolina governor\nI'm trying to remember wasn't she pretty much of a critic of Donald Trump\nI think so during the campaign if I remember right\nA lot of people thought that you know because she had talked about Donald Trump that kind of disqualified her as becoming the UN ambassador any role in the administration\nAs I said earlier she um grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants\nAnd she alluded to Trump and denouncing the siren call of the angry is voices who disrespected America's immigrants and Trump tweeted that the people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley but isn't it amazing that um you can go back and you can forget all of these kinds of things\nAnd it's just one of those things as you go back and well here we go\nNikki Haley is now the UN ambassador she's seemingly done a pretty good job\nA senior State Department official said a Haley told her staff this morning a source familiar with the matter said Haley's resignation has caught the national security adviser John Bolton and secretary of state Mike palm pale by surprise that's never good is it\nAnd teasing the announcement in the oval office Trump called Haley my friend big announcement coming so we'll see how this all goes down\nAll the former South Carolina Governor was tapped as ambassador to the un following Trump's election despite the fact that she did support if I recall Marco Rubio right\nAnd I'm\nMarco Rubio and she's also was supporting and later backing Ted Cruz ask if she would take the job back then Hayley um said well she was in tree but she had some conditions\nAre first she told Trump She wanted to be a member of the cabinet and the national Security Council and of course those were privileges were that were enjoyed by\nHer predecessors in the Obama administration and perhaps most importantly she wanted the latitude to be herself\nAnd she says hey I'm a policy person I Want to be part of that decision making process\nAnd Donald Trump said none\nI don't want to be a wallflower or talking head I Want to be able to speak my mind Trump's has done and then he ... the next thing though she is the ambassador to the un and seemingly kind of a rock in that administration\nUm she says I didn't think they were going to take me up on everything I asked for\nBut they did and I'm\nSure her more than a year and a half on the job is she a route is long except for\nWell I I don't know who would be in there longer there are many of them have left at this point obviously the vice president has left Kellyanne Conway still there\nBut my thought on the entire thing is that you know you're in there for a while and it's pretty much seven days a week twenty four hours a day and you are at the behest of whoever\nIs running this department and what are you going to do you're basically going to jump up and they say how high and ah you jump that high that is really what goes on\nThe hill is saying this morning that the Mickey Haley was happy being this um\nHayley the former governor of South Carolina joined the administration and twenty Seventeen four days after Trump officially took office\n\nSo that's where we are right now and as you say would you know we're sitting here at the at the behest of the Donald Trump schedule at least is usually not as late\nAs a President Clinton used to be remember Hayley the former South Carolina Governor joined the administration and twenty Seventeen just four days afterwards and now apparently she\nIs leaving All right before we go any further let me talk about our friends are young stand computer there six hundred young some polling road next rips see them in the paper last night and I think so

yeah you know what wait for the next dumb thing he says or something like this but\nThe thing about it is that Nikki Haley we just took this from an hour ago the where oh my God this is right out of
