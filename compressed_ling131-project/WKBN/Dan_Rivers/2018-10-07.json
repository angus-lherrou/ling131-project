{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Just tell you a story about a young boy that we started sending in Guatemala and when he was a almost four years old his name as men well and every year that we've gone back to Guatemala and he he by the way is profoundly profoundly impaired\nBut he has learned to speak in his ... his speech is really good it's very very clear but he's had hearing aids his whole life since he was four\nAnd a fast forward every year we would go down to do our missions um he would say can I help you can I volunteer\nAnd he learned how to uh put new tubes in them and fix them repair them he even knows how to clean ears you know there's no licensing laws there like there are here um so we supply them with a lot of different things that that he needs\nAnd the committee for the deaf and blind and Guatemala hired him they hired him to be a technician\nSo here's someone that we gave a hand up to that was probably back in the year two thousand maybe maybe two thousand and one\nAnd now here he is with a job\nBecause he learned a skill he learned to speak having a hearing aid that that early on\nWho is now working for the committee for the deaf and blind dissipate position and he is thrilled he sends me pictures on Facebook at him and his uniform and he'll tell me where he's at\nAnd he's so excited that he gets to travel around the country and they just they just piling a van and go to the next hospital and they they do what's called the after care so any of the people that we've seen that have broken down hearing aids or need them texture ears cleaned he's one of the team members that helps take care of them so they can continue hearing well again\nRight he's he does basically the local maintenance when you guys aren't around right which is a good thing I mean right you know he he's he's feeling a gigantic void there but that's a that's why I say don't throw out any of these hearing aids people eager to understand that they can be reprogrammed\nOf for people in other countries that are are are dirt poor and the heart doctor show figuring out how to say well you know you don't qualify for this program but what can I Do to try to help you because you're just a few dollars over six this particular problem\nAnd that's just what they do a ... that's just what she does with this local mission so what I'm asking you to do is in essence spread the word if you're hearing it and once again if you know somebody that has\nAnd any type of hearing impairments that his financially strapped this'll be the program for them and doc I'm going to tell you I think in our community\nThere you know obviously we got plenty of people that are doing just fine but I think we get a large segment of our population that is genuinely struggling to get by each day and so they ... as they got older maybe they retired maybe they you know I Would hear about people that's ... that's my own\nA company that we have with it would help that are that you get five or six hundred dollars on your Social Security a month once right and you know that doesn't go very far to buy once you buy your groceries and that kind of stuff and there's a lot more of those people out there than\nThan you think is what I'm trying to say\nRight and you know the people that we've been interviewing are people that were hurt on the job years ago\nUm there was no workman's comp or couldn't collect workman's comp and we're very badly injured couldn't work anymore\nThey're just really sad stories um you've heard me before tell the stories of grandparents and great grandparents that are now raising their grandchildren and they're great grandchildren because of\nDrug and alcohol problems of the parents of these young children and these are people who were you know living paycheck to paycheck or a Social Security check to Social Security check\nAnd who now have more mouths to feed and they need their hearing it it's for survival it's hearing the child are they well are they crime down the hall are these sic\n'em and they're struggling\nSo there there are a lot of people out there that we're just not aware of right and give me that number one more time please alright so again you can call any of the Senate fearing care offices and they'll direct you but the number is three three zero\nSeven seven nine eight zero nine zero three three zero seven seven nine eight zero nine zero and we'll get your application started\nWe were talking about obviously the local mission is going on but it's just a reminder folks I mean she's often said on the programs that we've done in the past the best thing to do is to protect your hearing I mean a large part of why people lose hearing is because they're\nExposed to loud noise over a long period of time you often make the comparison it's like walking to your mailbox on this same piece of grass constantly and eventually the grass wears away and that one particular area so if you have a same\nLoud type noise that you hear a day after day after day like that that's where you need to have the hearing protection that you're talking about to prevent losing this stuff in the first place stock is what you like to say to preventative is the best measure on things along those lines\nAlso if you're a diabetic you can affect your hearing as well I mean a lot of people don't know the diabetes affects not only their vision but they're hearing if you're on a certain chemo drugs that could affect your\nHearing as well you're a big believer and getting baseline hearing tests I Want people to understand so that we have something to compare it to if you just started to go on chemotherapy should ever be flying hearing test\nIf you're a diabetic you should have a baseline hearing test\nA you should try to prevent losing your hearing you know certain avenues with it that we talked about so there are many things that are that you can do to\nA kind of look out for yourself that I've learned from talking with Dr ... out on one other thing I Want to mention whenever you go wherever you might be a what a cause for hearing\nA assistance you definitely want an audiologist you want to make sure that they can accept Medicare is that correct doc I mean that's the standards yeah that's all right so you want to make sure that they can accept Medicare that their audiologist\nA and that and let you know that they are people that have met the criteria are heavy experienced a and frankly all of those things stack up to the Centers for hearing care that's why I always say that I can solve all of those complicated things for you by simply visiting\nA visiting the folks that I mentioned\n... do people get hearing aids you know like you when you have classes sometimes you're ... you have to go get a you know a year later two years later and you notice your vision is getting worse or whatever this is the same thing happened with folks with hearing aids or or to the one once you program you have to come in for a yearly\nReevaluate it sure does it stay pretty consistent with how you programmed him initially\n[noise] well the hearing aids definitely stay program however we are programmed and in the first place but the problem becomes if they're not taking care of them\nThe hearing aids can break down if they're plugging up with a wax I had a I had a patient today his hearing aids were just so clogged with wax and he said you know they're not working and I said are you cleaning them every day and he said\nNo no no the docket doc here's what he said oh of course I took 'em off [laughter] I think\nHe knew better than to say that ah so that's one thing that can happen is people forget you know you're busy and you don't realize that\nYou know take a speaker that you have at home a very high quality Hi fi speaker and throw mud on it that's what ear wax does to a speaker on a hearing aid well how is that speaker going to sound the next patient that comes in and said Mr so and so we haven't seen you in a long time oh I'm just here for cleaning check but\nI don't know if this right ones working I said okay well we're going to clean them up and find out and he's only had him about six months\nAnd you can't understand why I mean it would be an easy thing to forget so I mean don't you know it's almost a good thing because\nBecome so accustomed to this solving or fixing your problem but when you're it becomes such a part of your life you just happen to shower forget about it right then I Would imagine\nIt's a fairly common thing you are the ones that you can do that with aren't there the inner ear ones that you said you could do that with [noise]\nThere are they are an implantable device so they are something completely different so yes they are hearing aid yes they are tremendously expensive unfortunately but it's it's a convenient product so you buy a yearly subscription\nSo how do you get a hold of Dr Sheryl ... from the Centers for hearing care they're bunch offices around I can tell you the one in Salem is right across from the Dairy Queen and one of the other locations\nAnd York Avenue which is right behind Dillard liberty where across the street from Walmart behind McDonalds and how long were right behind the post office and Colombian and we're on the east park and the Colombian and medical center that somebody said on hospitals and up and pepper piper right off lander circle\nRecall the board in an office for the one closest to you audiologist people with a white glove treatments it's the Centers for hearing care

sworn in as Supreme Court justice last night at followed a showdown on the Senate floor with protesters shouting from the gallery as vice president Mike Pence the final voting process sergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery\nAnd documenting is why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are\nDeficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from sun\nWhat makes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet they can actually feel the difference\nSecond I use the right type of vitamin D in my formula and third I worked with an advanced team of scientists and they're using this technology to put it in this vast dissolving melt for immediate absorption\nAnd quick results that you can feel\nNow is your fast melt vitamin D three formula manufactured here in the U.S Dr ...\nAbsolutely my formulas manufactured right here in the usa critics in fact\nWe have a facility that is a C. G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices and this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the FDA came in and did an infection and they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how you're ... three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWhile diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does is it takes that problem and it seems to fix it now\nThey've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this insulin signature by sixty percent\nAnd just to give it a comparison the most popular diabetic drive you improve the Thirteen percent\nWow now let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast melt these three formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals that your immune cells produce to fight off bacteria and viruses let's here's someone that was tapped to both having any type of called fluke I Would start right now taking one of my vitamin D three miles every day\nAnd one of the nice things about this is that the size of your immune system being better\nYou'll find your energy better you'll find less pain less arthritic type pain more mobility flexibility better muscle strength and if you're someone who is concerned about falling you don't have better balance and a better sense of walking which is so important is that\nSo and and how do you take a doctor biggest\nYou can take it in the morning you could take it at night you don't need water and you put in your mouth and you know maybe call to thirtieth gone\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of result to be seen\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might the tree has actually traveling and I ran out of it so what happened to me that you know I'm basically pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this this is weird but then I realized that I'd run out of\n... formula and I went off of it for several weeks and I'm the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it\nThat's how you know somebody's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best tests that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nHugo I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it next time you give up the number to have people orders is go ahead and order it I Know you mentioned that the risks free offer and go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then you're still doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to

what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements\nJoining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and Dr biggest what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying criticism multifaceted problem where one we're\nNot getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because in medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the phone we get enough being outside and in our middle and end the story right and for the first twenty\nSome years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred studies\nThat show that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on my item in the war from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of pot is right there and I went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and out all night it was a link going back to the vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... D three formula help with that yeah\nIt's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a clown the thing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack of flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that sets this set in the end that's associated with a lack of there's vitamin D three

our\nCurrent issue Dave Schmidt will tell us about marriage and family life in the dice of Youngstown\nMy name's Dave Schmidt I'm the director of the office of pro life marriage and family life the Catholic dioceses Youngstown when it comes to the pro life part of my job description I take my marching orders from the past ... plan for pro life activities issued by the U.S conference of Catholic bishops\nAs you might expect this past year plan primarily addresses threats to human life such as abortion and euthanasia and assisted suicide\nBut it does so in the context of recognizing as a threat to human life among which is the death penalty the issue of the death penalty was given renewed attention this past August when cardinal Lewis the sorry a pre effect of the Vatican's congregation for the doctrine of the fate\nIssued a letter to the bishops of the world announcing that Pope Francis had approved a change to the section of the ... the Catholic Church dealing with the death penalty\nHere is the new wording of that section of the ... and I quote\nRecourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority following a fair trial was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and unacceptable I'll be at extreme means of safeguarding the common good\nToday however there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes in addition a new understanding has emerged as the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state\nLastly more effective systems of detention have been developed which ensured that do protection of citizens but at the same time do not definitively deprived the guilty of the possibility of redemption\nConsequently the church teaches in the light of the gospel that the death penalty is an ad missile because it is an attack on the viability and dignity of the person and she works with determination for its abolition worldwide unquote\nThis change in wording is intended to reflect the teaching of recent popes for instance in Nineteen Ninety eight Pope John Paul the second said\nA sign of hope is increasing recognition that the dignity of the human person must never be taken away even in the case of someone who has done great evil\nModern society has that means of protecting itself without definitively denying criminals the chance of reform likewise Pope Benedict the sixteenth challenged the attention of society's leaders did they need to make every effort to eliminate the death penalty\nAnd Pope Francis has reaffirmed that today capital punishment is unacceptable however serious that condemns crimes may have that\nThis teaching may prove to be particularly challenge to many in the United states has the U.S bishops observed the United states is the only western industrialized nation today that utilize this capital punishment\nBut the question to ask ourselves says why do we think we need the death penalty\nAfter all if an offender has been arrested tried and found guilty and has already been rendered harmless and no longer a threat to society by virtue of incarceration\nWhy do we deem it necessary to take the additional step of taking the life of the perpetrator\nAnd his Catholic Christians how does this square with the words of Jesus and the sermon on them out when he says you have heard it said you should love your neighbor and hate your enemy but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be children of your heavenly father\nPlus there's the additional concern of the death penalty being applied in accurately and unfairly\nHas Pope Francis has observed the death penalty is to be rejected due to the defect is selectivity of the criminal justice system and in the face of the possibility of judicial air\nFor instance in the United states a disproportionate percentage of minority men are sentenced to death\nAnd one of the parishes and our diocese has a parishioner who spent nearly Thirty years on death row until DNA evidence proved that he could not have done the crime is charged\nInvites you to learn more about the teaching of the Catholic Church on the death penalty specifically I invite you to attend a program entitled Catholic teaching and the scandal of capital punishment a real life example\nThis program will take place on Sunday October twenty eight that twelve thirty PM at St Michael perishing Canfield\nFor more information on this program contact the diocese of Youngstown at three three zero seven

lower it as much as sixty Seventy eighty points or in a week and amazingly I've seen some people's cholesterol come down eight points in the first week\nWhich is just amazing to me but it speaks highly of the types of foods we're supposed to eat and the power to heal that our body has if we just follow those simple rules so ah anyway the number\nHere at the studio when you want to call in in the second half of the show is three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven that's seven to nine nine nine seven seven\nAnd we're going to hope somebody up or two people first two callers

lucky enough and you want one you can call my office and will set you up with one or not free though I Can't give them away as much as I Would like to sew but back on back to my thoughts are [noise] in general on health so what kind of health is it that we all desire\nWell how about that kind of health that we don't ever have to worry or think about\nYou know the kinds of health that we depend on to be there when we need it most vibrant health is waiting for us when we wake up each morning\nThe kind of exceptional health that you feel deep down inside every day not simply an absence of symptoms because man there's a lot of sick people out there\nBelieve it or not some people or their body is too sick and congested to even get sick and someday I'll go into that a little bit but that is a fact and\nIf you want that kind of health that you can actually feel deep inside and so even if you're in your sixties and seventies and eighties you know you're still able to keep up with your kids and grandkids to a degree now this isn't a some magical miracle thing but if you want to be able to keep up with your grandkids\nThat's rare kinds of health indeed and that's the kind of health that I'm here to tell you about today\nI have felt this kind of health\nAnd to be honest with you I can honestly say I do enjoy that health now now is it a straight line you reach your destination destination of health and you never feel any symptoms at all no that's not the case because that's not what real health is\nBut it's more than an absolute ... symptoms and it is a vibrancy that you can feel inside and uh I Hope that one day you can experience that and if you follow my lead and you listen to meet Sunday I'll take you that direction\nI'll show you how to do it it's taken me years to find my journey to this level of health really has been haphazard at best\nAnd ah I've read hundreds of books hundreds of research articles drug and supplement propaganda goal or waited my way through the garbage put out by those looking to simply profit from your sickness and don't really care what the results are as long as they're making sales\nAnd I can now say that I Know build a healthy body and uh I'm here to teach you that\nIt's a simple concept but achieving it\nAnd really honestly base yeah sometimes it can be really challenging\nAnd the biggest obstacle I found really as our own reluctance\nTo give up the petty meaningless little habits that we have every day you know the habits of eating destructive foods everyday and many of those we were growing up you know our our parents may be taught us how to you know what kinds of foods that they liked and so those trickled on down to us\nBut the fact of the matter is if we're willing to be bold and step out and make a change and reach you know try to\nJust incorporate more of these plant based foods into our diet with the the thought that eventually you get on that what I like to call the straight and narrow paths that health and or\nWhat and I love this quote and I know I've said it before but it deserves repeating over and over one of the most profound quote survivor heard is from the Bible and that is from Matthew chapter seven first fourteen but small as the gate\nAnd narrow the road that leads to life in only a few find it and why is it that only a few find it because only a few are willing to do what it takes to get to that level of health it's\nNot easy and you know it it it takes an effort it takes a concerted effort effort and there will be many many opportunities to fall off of that path and do things that you shouldn't do that will interrupt that process of being healthy and so this closer east data that path\nThat healthier you'll be in man I learned that all the time you know I I think you know I may not be the smartest guy on earth but when I learned something I really understand that I make sure that I get to the point where I understand it\nAnd still there are times when all fall off that path but\nThat's just human nature and luckily there's forgiveness build in there and our body actually will forgive us for those little mishaps as long as we get back to the path as quickly as we can so\nThat that quote but small as the gate and narrow the path that leads to life in only a few find it you know that that was written for spiritual purposes I Believe but it could easily have been written about health\nIs it fits perfectly in so listen up if you really want to learn to be healthy you need to immerse yourself in what I share with you we leak each week\nYou know I see this with patients all the time in life has a way of taking you off path off target basically you know our minister church talked about this a few weeks ago\nYou know falling away from your target and not keeping that in in your focus and so with my patients my nutrition patience I Try to get them to make their health their center of focus the thing that they focus on everything else in life comes in and around it\nSo when you get to that and you and you follow that path long enough you get to a point where it becomes second nature and you don't even have to think about it you do that every day and then\nThings can start to take center stage more but\nThat on that will never go away your focus on health you'll always have it because basically it's part of your fiber part of your being at that point it's part of your natural diet just like many of the foods are now that are not so healthy or part of your natural diet and that's why they're so hard to give up\nBut the effort to change that is absolutely worth it\nSo to get you to really focus on this one of the things that I'm doing is expanding ... you know what I'm doing here on the radio this is my message I come to you once a week it's a long time one week to the next and it's easy to fall off course\nAnd I used to do a newsletter on line and uh I I I think I had about four hundred followers on that and does a nice group of people and you know I just really wasn't very good at staying up with it\nBut I found a way now to make that much easier I so busy during the week and I'm not complaining I'm I honestly feel blessed for all the different things I have going on in my life that really make it rich but\nUm I now I really think I can keep up with a once a week thing so if you go to my Web site at Dr David ...

I thought so I went and got a test I went to a hand doctor and then I went and got is that an Angie test right right okay so they came up with um I have the right hand I don't have nerve damage so I'm not to the point where\nI'm waking up in dire pain or dropping things that my hands aren't you know they they get they get nomination they get a tan gray sometimes I wear a brace that he came up with the fact that I got a touch of arthritis maybe ten denied it and some carpal tunnel going okay I've got the rain not\nSyndrome going on to and the cold if I go in a grocery store and it gets really cold my hand my fingertips kept my bluish right and I mean that guy is away\nAnd my fingers are swelling which is really bugging me that really I I and I really do I ask them what you get operated on it if it was your hand the right hand and he said now until it got to the point where it's dropping things an aimless really that\nGood doctor I Love guy editor conservative and and you'll see that more of these days they're getting more and more conservative on surgery so\nSo I I that made me trust him you know so my question is now um I Know there's exercises to do for it and stuff and I just want to know how can I what what plan of action should I Do I should write I can do without lying down right\nOkay so so the rain all this thing is circulatory and that has to do with your blood this costs city and to get your blood thinner naturally you need to go more toward a plant based diet and that will help overtime\nOr as far as the carpal tunnel goes or whatever tend tonight is I mean I see patients these symptoms all the time there are things at work pretty well one is having a chiropractor adjust your wrist will help and I have some patients that alone helps\nUh I Do ah the adjustment on the wrist and then I normally do what they call underwater ultrasound so we'll do all over the area to help get the inflammation under control\nBut here's things you can do at home one is I have my patient squeeze a a rubber ball at home and try to try to oppose your thumb and little finger because that helps to actually increased the arch in your wrist and it'll decrease the pressure on the nerves in there\nAnd so that squeezing action and it just squeezing is strengthening the muscles in your hand actually helps too because that builds tone and those muscles and helps to improve the way the joints kinda fits together and move and the stability of those joints in with your work that's that's going to be important\nHere is another thing that I like at home you know sit in a chair and put your risk the palm Saudi your wrist on an ice pack\nA with a thin towel over the ice told me that yeah and do that for about Fifteen minutes at a time trying to do it twice in the evening let it warm up for an hour in between two Fifteen minutes of the time\nThe one other thing that helps at home is to use the risk supports they keep their wrists straight when you sleep\nI Do that okay because a lot of people tend to call their risk when they sleep in ... the nerve in the blood vessel because the nerve and blood vessel come together as he was actually a couple of blood vessels and nerves\nCome together through the risk and that potential for getting that inflammation under control will be better I always tell my patients like this\nIf you were a roofer and you did it the old fashioned way ... hammer nails into shingles everyday and inevitably you're going to smack your thumb one or two times a day at least because you're gonna miss the nail eventually I've done I Know so\nSo if you are if you just stop hitting here's some for a while it'll get better and it has the same thing with your risk you know if you can do the things that take the stress off that and reduce the pain eventually we're going to improve so good and\nWhat I wanted to ask and he told me I might want to thank for the right not Cinderella that's taking a baby aspirin\nIn the morning to you know this is why this is is it a medical doctor asserted hand\nOkay ice probably a surgeon so he understands that uh that decreases the stickiness of the platelets in the red blood cells which helps improve circulation I'm Glad you said that because\nHere's the other thing about that it that may reduce the stickiness but there are other factors in your blood deter contributed contributing to it being thicker than it should be and slowing the flow goes all come from our diet\nAnd potentially for you breathing the hairspray may be an effect ... if you smoke that's huge you got to quit smoking\n... okay and I wear a mask I don't spray that much and I only work a couple of days now so I I wear a mask when I write\nOkay you're on the right track so the rain all its give it time and work with it and over time you you probably noticed a difference with", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Rivers", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "07"}
