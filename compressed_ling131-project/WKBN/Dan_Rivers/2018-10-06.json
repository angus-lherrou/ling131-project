{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Discovered a of a place that I don't think was on your radar certainly wasn't on mine that turned out to be the successful on his part\nYeah that um you know at the hunter that kind of\nThe way it goes antelope valley where you find them but ah yeah it it's so easy to scout because as you mentioned when you're out there it's\nWide open spaces they can kind of stopping glass and see if if you're seeing antelope and after killer area so um [noise] that general area where we ended up with your blind had been\nKind of a backup thought for me but I hadn't got it at the degree that you and I did and you're absolutely right once they went to where I had originally set up your blind there weren't any fresh track that we had to we had to get their game plan\nYeah and you are not a above on her at all you view of harvest your your share of of antelope but because I wanted to try it first with across the bow\nI'm your hands are a little bit tied in terms of specific advice because again you know you're a local resident and you you hunt with a rifle and I was sort of are pushing the envelope a little bit by wanting to try to get into ...\nYeah we both learned a lot with the trip [laughter] first shared it was that it was a lot of fun for me to learn a little bit more about blind hunting for antelope I'm focusing in on getting closer and that was watering Hong\n... and learning to look for some of the things you needed I needed to know about\n... what what was interesting for me is how I was able to apply might whitetail hunting um experience\nDo antelope because as it turned out we set up on a on a natural funnel area where the antelope to get from one big area to another area to feed had to follow between the water hole\nWith a cotton wood and a blow off on the other side so that it didn't necessarily bring them into bow range but it certainly brought them within range of your mother's thirty six if I can say so yeah absolutely\nYeah when I was packing for the trip\nI'm a ... really to weapons is what I what I the capacity of I had to to fly with because I did fly out for the strip and rented a car in Denver and um had to choose between a thirty six and a a in a shotgun and my my ... my my ten point and picked across the bow and shock on\nAnd when it came time when we realized that uh the envelope it was the last days of the boat season or they just weren't going to come within within a within bow range that we decided to uh to go with the uh thirty six and I'm In case there were you you can use my mom's which I just thought was\nThat was kind of cool and I go there get itself yeah yeah yeah yeah Craig special it was a hand me down and\nShe no longer uses and and for me anyway family in such a big part of hunting that's where so many of us learn it from and so being able to share that kind of legacy and is that we felt\nIt was it was from the site as well\n[noise] well for listeners who want to set this up there are ways to uh to increase your odds of getting chosen you can buy a preference points are at about thirty dollars each um for your area that you want to hunt up to uh some of them you can buy two preference point some of them three for thirty bucks apiece and\nWhere if you buy two or three you're really up your odds of getting a chosen and being able to actually go out in an envelope and your preferred area\nAnd really that's a that's a great resource especially when you're when you're planning a trip around it for me I don't drive like oh well it would be something else and opening day but for you you're you know for somebody traveling here you're planting a lot around that\nI'm kind of risk of whether or not you're even going to have a Lakers Phil so\n[noise] um the whining game and fish department offers give preference points and so once you've identified your area I\nCan take a look and you can even he your likelihood of drying without a preference point in that particular area on your likelihood of drawing with one preference point for an extra thirty back with kids with three and then you can it can really look at ... at the chances of a\nReally increasing your odds of drying for a fairly nominal extra extent\nYeah I was fortunate I you know this was a budget trip for me so I could only afford I went through with the one preference point had five to ten percent chance of getting chosen and was fortunate enough to get chosen on that but if you've got a little bit bigger budgets and I have certainly you can\nYou can buy more speaking a budget I Can't I Can't let you go before we sure where that head is right now\nI Know this is the this isn't really pretty cool thing they're in a a high school class and ... billion Wyoming at Wind River middle school and high school\nOther than them and it is a business and it caught by um Mr gods now they're gods now and go with kids take\nHead from hunters and turn them into European now for fifty to Seventy five dollars depending on the\nOn the seas um seven your case the antelope was fifty bucks and you'll get it back in about six weeks and they'll get 'em funds to continue running their business and scholarships for some of those kids at the end of the school year\nOr fifty dollars you couldn't be better spent I mean I was worried about [noise]\nUh you know we donated the meat okay to do to to to charities okay to various charities there\nAnd but the head it's like you know I Want something to remember this by but I Can't afford you know of a full you know amount of a of a head and you said got got you covered with this school program just bugs and bones and the kids learn to rear these bugs these beetles and maintain them and populations big enough and all too\nTo take him a head and it's not only antelope in and out kids and deer heads for Marin in Wyoming those kids except except mount\nProjects from all over the U.S\nA pretty cool it's a neat operation to when I dropped or\nYour trophy are um it was fun to see how these kids just running the whole show you know there was one teacher and they're making sure everything was on track but they they had it under control I only ever interacted with high school students day I'm sent me through the process took off with the head and\nAnd they'll call me when it's done in look at it back to the right Stacy thank you again on which can you share the website for the wind river of visitors council and the game department there that listeners need to go to if they want to follow in my wake\nAbsolutely Wyoming game and fish department is W. E. S. T. dot W. I. O. N. G. O. V. and no wonder visitors council is Wind River dot org\nCasey thank you very much I Hope you are you get to a interact with some of my listeners in the years to come folks who are not excited about getting out and trying to hunt up their own antelope thank you very much thank you\nSpring that device that I use like let's say in the gun safe to keep the condensation moisture from inside there is a work in a boat like that too or animal or to it's similar\nTo it all a lot of times they have what they call moisture bags or it's a product that absorbs and holds moisture than that moisture drops in that bag and then you can just throw the bag away come spring\nBut if you have the ability to to plug something in that that concerns people have obviously as you're spending a lot of ah resources you know running that the ... fire or what have you or what if something would a short out or catch fire\nYou're better off not plugging anything in ... ah don't ask you\nWhat is the first thing than a I'm a let's say I'm the type a boat or that I transport my boat back and forth I don't have mine in the water sitting there it's not a Berliner west branch sitting at the dark you know uh it's one that I transport\nI normally keep it covered ah outside bomb would or some of the basics it I should be looking at it this time of year before it gets cold\nOh you're going to want to do trailer maintenance to ... you know you said you go forced to the lake so you're probably putting your trailer in the water more than the average motor ... so we'll bearings are going to need inspected make sure there's no water and there are no water in the lights\nYou know the trailers that or to frame that are painted their not painted on the inside you're going to want to make sure that you're checking in inspecting things like that breaks you know if you qualify or need to have brakes on your a vehicle\nMight trailers Twenty years old and the ... I Do you call them bunkers write the book comes up all the bunks learning what um\nHow do I fix something like that\nYeah you need to get the vote off of the trailer um you know we've had people just kind of lift them up a little bit well jak fails or something you're you're not want to have your fingers in there that's raping and create problems that are yeah those have been made out of ... you know what in the past and ah\nThere's other products that are available it just depends on what you want to spend but\nThat is one of the areas is really a overlooked because you don't really see them when the boats on it the ... uh that's what support your boat\nSo we gotta make sure let's check our wheels are tires Martin lights the trailer itself the bumps or the hitch yeah make sure that he was in good operating condition\nThat pretty much dead that pretty much kind of ... take a look at the trailers and that's probably one of the harder things to do because then you've got to Jack it up with the boat and that if you're going to do any repairs or if you can look to boat somewhere for a day you could make those repairs and it wouldn't be too much problem [noise]\nOkay so we take care of the trailer what's the next item ... that's the most concern\nI Would say the engine or the propulsion system mhm whether to an outlawed where there's an eye oh jet drive\nA those are going to need certain maintenance is you know there's two stroke product for stroke product so each manufactures going to have a specific direction um or maintenance that it would need you know for stroke obviously is going to have engine oil in a crank case a\nTo stroke product is going to have you know oil and an oil injection system or if it's an older product prior to oil injection is going to be a pre mixed product\nOr the motors to de de signed that I can do some of this myself or do they take more a special equipment to drain oil and put new oil in that type of thing you\nKnow it it depends on I mean we're human beings are human beings with with the right training knowledge or you know you can do it also it does take some specific tool sometimes because some of the engines you don't drain the oil out the bottom of a a crank case or an oil pan\nIs extracted out the dipstick too so you can pump sometimes\nUm you know you need the ability to start it and run it to warm it up so that the oil is going to flow out are easily\nSo it can be done by an individual [noise]\nDo the owner's manuals pretty much cover that type of um service\nIn the past they didn't do a very good job of it because they were really a vague because they didn't want the owners are doing certain things they were trying to set it up for dealers but the manufacturers now are really trying to educate the consumer so that they\nA do it right if they do a do it themselves and it helps them understand what needs to be done and also some of the manufacturers are using Q.
