border\nBut that will be the focus of what we're doing today but um there's some other things you start giving I'm not not somebody going to be stuck on one topic all day but I was just thinking to myself in\nIs there a fallacy in my thinking here you know I I look at what they were doing in Poland list I'd having your rally at the school\nAnd they wanted to give out information the schoolteachers\nOver there are now embroiled in a contract where they have a federal mediator trying to figure out how they're going to settle this and you have the president the school board is saying you know what it's in the hands of a federal mediator\nWe are looking at a deficit as we and they should be looking down the road and they are we're looking at a deficit as we go but here's the thing about it\nWhat do you do\nWhen you have a shrinking school system if you want to be selfish about this and if you look at the numbers most schools here in northeast Ohio are on a downward trajectory\nThat's just a fact of life I which was different I Wish we had a lot of people moving into the area in saying this is a great place to live but it's just not the case\nThe average age of our area continues to increase there's no magic bullet to get people to move in and the numbers that we need to have school systems that are thriving most of them were built for many more students\nAnd what it comes down to if you just want to go back\nSay okay I get it you want more money that means that we are going to have to lay off the numbers of people to reach the money that we can give individuals that means less employed but and you know what maybe it should be right off the bat if you think about\nIf you're a school system is all of a downward trajectory\nYeah well to bring in this year because we've had so much experience with all the blue sky it's not happening it's not happening now we're on a pretty good role here in this country but it's not necessarily translating to northeast Ohio it's somewhat translating to western Pennsylvania with Pittsburgh where there's a lot of activity but it hasn't filtered over here\nSome other activity what the hospital systems that they have in Cleveland but\nIt hasn't really gotten here we just closed a hospital anyway getting this if you only get more of a listener raw and he'll tell you exactly what he thinks in the afternoon about all of that and he's been carving on this for a long time he's completely taxed out oh I Know we could probably all give a little bit more\nBut uh you know I'm a mind if I were to give them to give to my family and I'm going to give to my church and I'm going to do those kinds of things I would've given the rescue mission places where I think there's what's working and then you've got this caravan\nSo people think that we should have this caravan come into the United states and there are people out there in fact I talked to a few of them they say well you know these Hispanic people or the hardest working people in the world\nWell you know what\nHow about a swift kick for the people over here in the United states who have decided that they can beat the system\nThat's where you get more people back in the workforce\nBut people over here that are coming to the United states I won't get I'll give you this most of them are good people but Donald Trump is not wrong what he says who do you know that has vetted the people that are in that\nTheir population is going to have sex offenders gonna have drug dealers or they're going to have gang members should we stand by while them I don't think there's anybody in the numbers that they're going to need that are going to say yeah bringing that caravan and if the Democrats are saying that it's going to be a losing topic for them\n[noise] people are going to say yeah that's just what I Need to bring in more pressure to my school system where we're going to distribute maybe ten thousand kids across the United states and the school district in that school district is going to take it and you're going to be teaching in a language that you're not familiar with show you need to hire another teacher we need to tire interpreter\nYeah we got a republic we've ... we hold onto it we're going to have to show some tough love and you know what I don't think that\nThat's a bad thing because what we do we show a little bit of tough love but what we do is we go out and we have missionaries but go to that part of the world and we have people that are willing to go and help people live in that part of the

completely and totally guaranteed where the cost of living increases 'til the day they die\nIt's can you say Greece I mean it's just absolutely outrageous\nYeah I don't know Don did you hear me talking yesterday I ran into a family of seven mom and dad five kids Eighteen hundred dollars a month for Obamacare So I thought that was bad lady calls and she said um\nMy husband had to retire early and we had to pay the cobra and uh the Obamacare ended up being twenty two hundred dollars a year so I mean when you're talking about this and you hear teachers saying well we're contributing ten cent ten percent or salaries ... say God Bless you you know that's a that's a bargain isn't it\nYeah absolutely and on top of that the government employee regardless of how confident are how ineffective they are you can't get rid of them you can't fire them\nWell uh you know what I don't know what kind of work you do but\nI I can tell you in the private sector people have downsized because of the digital because of computers we don't travel anymore do does your company travel any more you know you you just it's just unheard of any more people have cut expenses to the bone done anything else\nOr you are and you're talking about downsizing it's not it's it's everywhere there used to be three men on a garbage truck\nDo you remember those days you know the guy driving in a robotic arm\nYeah or the guy's driving into going out and dumping it himself\nYeah there's one guy yeah so\nThat technology you know they talked about shipping jobs overseas the technology is what's taking away jobs and people demand skilled wages for unskilled labor or you don't have to worry about the minimum wage if you get a skilled do some training and get some education make yourself employable\nWell here's another thing too if you go back and you look at those in the teachers have never fully answered this if in fact you're teaching a hundred and eighty days a year\nAnd a that's a pretty good job and most people in the private sector are working two hundred and sixty days a year with a month off for vacation people are still sixty days ahead in the private sector of what they're doing\nIn the end up in the in the school systems and those people are getting a comparable if not higher salary\nYou know what no wonder people are either jealous or they're saying there is no more room at the end\nRight\nRight and as far as property taxes paying for schools I'm not going to blame that on the legislature Supreme Ohio Supreme Court ruled on in the wrong decision\nAnd they they put absolutely no enforcement they're part of that decision should have been you've got a year and then you can't collect property taxes to pay for schools that's the only way you get the legislature a move is if you put a time limit and a penalty on\n[noise] that's true I mean you know you're right there was no teeth and that at all or the end that thing has languished for ten plus years\nOh yeah longer than a motor that I'm close closer to twenty\nTwenty years and uh you know we thought well gee and and that used to be the big topic of the Dan Ryan program we don't want to be dependent on the on property taxes any longer we still are\nReally are you still think you've done but thank you very much\nAre you know what maybe maybe maybe the answer is in the lottery or what do you think Jay ... go ahead and to just make the lottery or make some kind of a big lottery we can have plenty of money to pay the teachers what would you do if you had the lottery\nOr actually hiking when he said he was going to no one made a decision for the kid I buy it and it yeah you know one this third ticket I got a whole split with all the employees that ...\nDentist the dentist or you may

one\nI don't really think that you would have a simple life after this because you would have to deal with this money unless you've just took a share and gave all the rest of the way that\nI got on your lap plenty of chance that thing you know all that data\nBank eagle appreciate it yeah I mean just think about\nThis with money\nComes responsibility how many people to run into and they say well I've got to worry about this I own my my thought to them as soon as you know what is not a good problem to have the\nAlternative is that you don't have money [laughter] but like I'm pulling they really don't have money they're talking about the fact that they would have and and the teachers are shameless and saying\nBut other levy on put a levee on so you can pay the teachers we need an increase\nI Wish it was different but this is not a growth area you James in Warren and teachers pay James come on in\nTheir servers I ever I typically agree with you and I sort of agree with you right now but I have a little bit\nDifferent perspective I work with a lot of teachers in their retirement planning and ah I did to listen to a lot of their story see ... especially within our Youngstown city and some of the urban school districts in northeast Ohio\nI can tell you that they're not making money hand over fist and they're required to get a master's degree\nAnd while I understand the idea of paying more taxes no one wants right ... we we need to take care of these teachers we need to find a solution in Ohio the previous caller the previous\nCaller before the last guy had it right the Supreme Court in Ohio said state tax or a property taxes pay for schools you know that's a problem so I you know you know the teachers are teaching right now so they can't call in to defend themselves but when you hear their stories\nAnd what they have to deal with teachers get fired by the way\nAnd it's not as difficult to fire teachers you think I've seen it happen\nOver what from my perspective obviously I wasn't in the whole story you know but from my perspective shenanigans\nYou know I I mean I Would like to have a little more violence in that I haven't heard a story like\nI haven't heard that story about you know teachers being fired except where they are doing inappropriate things um you know uh don't you think it's fairly rare when we hear about a teacher being fired for anything other than a morality charge\nThat you look at it so but\nI mean my ... go ahead\nI mean that's that's that that just common sense I mean that you know if you have teachers that are ... ... students and especially the bulk of people who've been fired but I I think here's the thing about it is that in this goes for Youngstown State university teachers also you have to realize the area that you have chosen to work in\nAnd even for my profession you know this is not this bird this is not Columbus this is Youngstown gets a little different here and ... no matter how much you and I would like to change that fact uh I just did a little bit of research and they say the average salary in boardman here is thirty one thousand dollars a year\nNow that's an average salary is a lot of people making a lot more than that but if you have an average salary in pole and maybe you don't do deal with the people in Poland because they say the average salary over there or sixty thousand dollars doesn't that tell you that there's a lot of teachers that are making eighty\nOr I don't think that's true well I Know they're making so so I Know they're making Seventy five hiring\nA new teachers are retiring out to order teachers so they can drive down that makes sense but ... I don't think the average is going to be eighty thousand dollars\nThey don't know no not I'm not I'm not ... not Amory but the average is sixty but I'm saying when you have a sixty thousand dollar average you have to have some teachers that are making eighty and some that are making forty\nWell yeah and then they've been in the business for Thirty years twenty five thirty years yeah and they have a skill\nThey deserve that money by\nGoing back to the full firing issue you know being fired directly like your fired is the same thing in my opinion as a ... minute straighter\nLiterally causing the teacher ... because they want to get rid of them\nNow whether they feature deserves to be fired or not I don't know mhm but they that does happen and if you ask enough teachers that they will tell you that they'll have diminished greater has a beef with the teacher and they will make their life miserable and so they quit\nAnd and not just how it works but\nDon't you know you're talking about having a skill or the teacher with a master's degree and they don't deserve sixty eight grand you're very come on\nWell you know here's the thing about it there's no question that they do and you could get that in a let's say pepper pike you could get that in a somewhere just outside of ah Columbus or in Columbus but\nI don't know that you do that here because you have chosen to live here with the cost of living that is less so I think the salaries are commensurate with your community\nWell I agree with you but you keep you have to keep in mind that that number is based on twenty twenty five thirty years of teaching\nFor you or an entry door all from window world ... ... and ... to be ... be Well Fred ... and I have a great day we'll see you see is a down the road okay Bye bye seven two six zero two hundred window world [noise]\nAll right folks here zippers October twenty third partly cloudy and fifty three tomorrow rain or wet snow forty seven [noise]\nAll brought to you by storm gene twenty seven and courting cigar box enjoyed [noise] alright are format is such that we take the Baltimore coals right after the news and that we have Dave and Bob and Jay and became all\nComing up and there's a place for you if you'd like to join his on five Seventy W.

motel six sides yeah I don't know if I Would get it done\nThen what what are you thinking what are you thinking what crazy suggestion that you have made one superintendent between several school systems talk about divided loyalties\nYou know you're a private industry example you're one entity it does not do the same for multiple communities who have specific interest in their school system\nSee now here's that's that's a great point that's a great point should we have specific interests in our communities what is the difference what is the goal of a school system in\nAnd if the goal is to graduate young scholars who we're going to go on to be contributors in their communities\nIn their neighborhoods in the state of Ohio to the country would that be the goal of every school system\nRight and what else would there be I\nYou can have break you can break down but we we don't really have that many magnet schools where you go there to become a math major science major or pre med mostly high schools\nAnd I think they're far too easy to tell you the truth how many seniors to UC then they'll say well I've got all my credits in them kind of hosting this year you know for some students high school is just a breeze\nNot so much for me because I have a lot of extra curricular activities so I mean I was shooting pool and things like that learning to be a hood [laughter]\n[laughter] but anyway is yeah you're right I I wasted my youth I wasted my youth on cars and\nThings like that but\nYou know the thing about it is why wouldn't you consolidate some of this stuff if your goal is to produce people that can go on to higher education or just start their life why would there be that much difference\nI think what you're really referring to is you've gotten down to community pride isn't that\nIn\nYou know it's it's it's really cool I mean to say that you can feel cardinal in Europe polling bulldog and you've got a big rivalry game coming up and maybe the last one\nThat is a community but I don't think you'd have to lose that\nYou're talking about superintendent but supervisors the entire county and then he has a lot of other people he I shouldn't say that she has a lot of other people under them that makes us happened what's wrong with that but I don't think it has to be that divided\nWhat else was people supporter what are they saying out here today to touch on Mario Mario says Dan I Am not voting on any levy\nOr for any Democrats either this thing has mentally exhausted ... everybody works hard they need an increasing their pay however can we afford it [noise] it's when it comes down to and I I don't really even think it's as you know what\nI Know teachers you know teachers and I was just thinking about\nThe uh the first teacher that I had in broadcasting thinking about um the other day and I haven't talked to him for years and wondering what he's doing\nBut you look at people to nurture you they are held in a place in society but a little bit of that changed when they started demonstrating and walking the picket lines of TV cameras photographed them\nYou look at him differently don't you [noise] same thing when you look at the the picket lines that uh what you consider to be an altruistic community like north side hospital all those years that we endured pickup lines\n\nPeople to care for us marching in the street\nYou have a different opinion is it just seems like that's the lowest form of our society are going on here where you where you put people on a pedestal probably what we need to do is probably just kind of take that off the table\nAnd make education a private industry just like every other one that seems to work the best that seems to work the best\nDan I'm with Donald Trump on this mob intrusion welcomed by the Democrats in the hopes\nVotes for safe keeping up their jobs\nYou know ...\n... if that's the case how can anybody in the valley\nThat has a shred of sense vote for the Democrats how can anybody do that I just don't think it is not possible it's not possible\nHe Dan here's something you can do up to ... I was carping about eyesight this morning then you can use the camera\nOn the phone to zoom in on the sim card so you can read it\nWhy did a short break down this morning and ... o'clock hour and I say I work two hundred and sixty days a year minus the twenty days vacation I get so I work two hundred and forty\nI think when people do and and the teachers are still working a hundred and eighty days plus ... and they're making their average their average salary in Poland is sixty thousand the average salary here in boardman just some around thirty one thousand dollars well\nDoes that include benefits because you know the benefit package for a public sector employees in Germany about a third more\nOh yeah and\nWell or not we're taking a thirty thousand dollars a year a mount and it it comes up ten\nTen thousand for the extra days and another ten dollars for the benefits they're just starting wage fifty thousand no\nI think they're compensated well enough\nUm as far as the education is concerned I've said just for well over a decade now we need to look at basic core education courses\nPublicly funded those have separate electives out separate extra curricular electives I think should be handled by a truck ... charter school system\nAnd set up by an account fund for individual\nAnd they can choose you know if if you wanted to learn Mandarin Chinese and you can find a um a a place around here and men are and try Chinese you can spend your money on that you'd have a set amount of money\nUm but you couldn't get everything that you want it so you'd have to make choices as a student now if you wanted more\nUh than than you know the ... the basic and and more than what the account where the law for in terms of extra curricular then then you'd have a like a like there's rather than than you would have to go ahead and ah ah you know get a job in the summertime you know you may work those jobs that Americans don't want to work\nUh then the other thing is the first extra clearly ah curricular courses are concerned I'm\n... activities\nI don't think schools should be funding sports I good physical education class\nBut baseball football you know those things should be handled like little league Babe Ruth pop Warner a you know if if people are interested then they're you know have a company's step up and and fun as you might have a little bit of money I guess from this account that could go to that but not very much the whole idea of having million dollar stadiums\nWhen when you know some schools don't have a a you know they they weren't million dollar stadium so then the next year they won their computers would be a\nReal well it's kind of all kinds of property taxes though too because the way we have it set up if you if you live in the higher in districts here your house is worth more than ... people liked the idea of people come to the school we have our own little uh area are fiefdom that people will say and we're proud of it\nWhat but here's the other part of that how many people how many teachers or employees actually live in the district which they're being paid secondly how many students once they graduate stays graduate stay in the area and I stay in that particular school district or or nearby district chances are it's very very few\nYeah no I mean I can tell you with Youngstown State to David Sweet said years ago that ... percent of Youngstown State graduates leave this area\nDan I sat down and figure out I graduated my class with a hundred and Seventy two I ran into the day I graduated and it's fifty years now or just even just in passing about twenty three twenty four percent ... that hunger oh yeah yeah\nI mean you know that are as I saw it not not now and again you know I've I've lived in Brookfield township I've lived in Sharon I Lived in a Harvard\nYard we're running out of time what you find a point to my\nMy point here is that uh from the standpoint of\nA immigration is concerned

socialistic country it absolutely will not work because people will become lazy and they will not help self interest and the people down in the places I'm Talking about they don't have that self interest\nYou know they don't have it because they don't see the fruits of their labor all they see is just more and more poverty why do you see so much poverty in that country and you don't see as much you're in the United states except\nFor the border states such as California and Arizona and Texas and Florida where you see people that have migrated into those areas those areas are starting to

our calls from an education but a junior isn't a young sounding Libya's in Portland who do I go to first well you know in all fairness Richard has been on the longest he's out there and stony point Richard thank you for all the information you send me I don't get to read at all but to appreciate the ever\nI'm thinking I say this morning with a drug free port there's the picture for the folks that one of those Tommy Hilfiger sweat shirt on I was thinking gee I Can't afford one of those\nMost of those things are knocked off though I mean those are all fake the John thanks for the Chinese they steal our name brands and they make them for about half the price of Tommy Hilfiger goes\nWell the comment I wanted to have an education if my granddaughter just graduated from the engineering course that they give the navy and Great Lakes are very they're going more and more toward a artificial intelligence for specific engineering project\nAnd they've they've got their education time and a half and the graduates come out a lot better than some of the journey man that have been doing the job for ten\nYears and um it with a knife through DARPA are organized station that it's called the cure this program ... and what what they\nDo have a um a supercomputer artificial intelligence\nInteracting with a student and very shortly knows what they do know and what they don't know and then work sonnet or in a very specific way instead of moving the stove or the information is moved to the student rather than transferring people all over this place for that place\nRight now and then you know it's just like everybody else so I mean you know if you can do things at home you're probably going to be better off a ... that's definitely where it's going to go but what are we doing the here and now because I Do understand that most of education is going to be done in your own home\nAnd just going to be done by um tell her tell her I'm tell a parting or whatever your call you\nKnow but what what do you do what do you do in the here and now do we continue to spend money on brick and mortar I think that that's a terrible investment right now for schools\nWell part of the problem is if you can follow they'd over real large area like a I had a granddaughter that with writing or an hour or two and an hour from school and that's funny or most precious commodity and they are in the community if the child we got two hours on a bus\nAnd and and it's probably average and a seven or eight miles an hour a diesel buff\nBut information is a hundred and sixty million a mile from\n... billion richer by Richard you take the Steve Jobs of the world God rest his soul and you take a a your favorite ... mosque\nThey have the answers the answer is not in government because the government is cumbersome and slow\nAnd they're presumed ... they're preserving the brick and mortar jobs they're going to be dinosaurs because you're not going to be I'm directing huge schools any longer because the kids are going to be doing it at home but I thank you for your call and anybody that\nIt's to sell you on a brand new school run like the wind here is um here's Lydia she is in a court when we don't get too many calls from Portland Lydia welcome to the show\nGreat show thank you know what that caller is\nMentioning is called competency based education that that promote education through computers and that and you're absolutely very very correct on that\nAnd I'm the only way we can get rid of or or get to that and they sell it that is to get rid of our achievement face a programs which includes court\nUm core curriculum and the general education program\nBoth of which off base everything on that wonderful bell curve\nWhich the bell curve this not measure the span of intellect in the classroom it sets the outcome for every test and math teacher uses white kids never get any better it's because anything a teacher uses a teaching math it cost to\nThe same results all the time that's how the testing companies make all their money they exploit your children with these tests\nAnd and I follow that method but why I call them the ticket\nIs I just it was so glad you brought up this whole business of our rights and the procedures that the ... an initiative for public referendum ... y ou teaching this\nUp process you know we're all taught from the time we were young and you are young about the legislative process of making a bill right that political science\nMajors aren't taught this in college in in our kids are not taught this in college in some of them will grow up to be these uh defeated are adults who just still we don't have a right we can't change anything because it's all up to two parties and their opinion\nYeah and do you think about the people out here we've pitted people against each other they're these teachers that were there last night and their families they're all good people that want the same thing that we do they want a good education they want a good ... committed to live in\nThe forget to the teachers are not blue collar workers they are white collar workers in there with the doctors and the attorneys who get paid two hundred dollars an hour versus sixteen dollars an hour and they have to continue the educational programs which the wonderful state of Ohio\nNot only requires them to get license years now and they continue their education forever\nThey they have put a termination deadline or for their their own degrees that they have and and have to actually go back to school for more education\nOr you've confuse me a little bit I don't even know where you're coming from on this litter you put out a lot of information about\nWhat do you have a masters then it's over seven years you have to go back and get a whole masters all over again before you can go on to your doctor\nAnd if and this is the other thing that state did\nIt once you get your masters created this deal a few years back the back door the teachers that all got those high credentials that allowed the state to hire lesser qualified teachers in place of those that that went on to life singer which had to get their licensure or they leave their credentials altogether\nSo that made the first batch of teachers they got their license unemployable so I mean while that politicians are out there telling you we need to raise the quality of our teachers they were back\nDuring all these teachers to hire lesser qualified people you know so\nYou know somebody we can relate to though is that you have teachers here that are now fighting for a one percent raise it doesn't seem like very much and then on the other side you have people\nThat say you know what I really don't want to pay any more taxes I agree\nWith them but you know the thing is is what we really need to do and like you said and you point out\nIs we have to change the program not the teachers and not anything else that the program is with the feeding your kids from the get go
