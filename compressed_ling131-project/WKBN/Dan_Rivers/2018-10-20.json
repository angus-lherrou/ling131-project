going to get these grants to do because to ration work on the ground\nSo all the the these funded by some people go to our Friday nights ... is the key the core element to us being able to have the

and talk about what you've done\nGain ideas from other hunters uh you know and of course what ducks unlimited has to offer and you know like you got a good meal out of a too so it's it's a great time it's a good time\nAnd I'm sure that that helps to promote the wetlands and provide you with the\nThe funds to do that how do you find out about wetlands\nThey need to have something done to him do

Cleveland I got on board here at at at AT T U so we are a science based organization and that means that we use science to tell us what to do our work\nWe partner with um a national and state wide in an international organizations to really help us\nDetermine what's what's the best place to do our work you know with our resources\nThat we have the science team both here and the great lakes region and across the U.S Mexico and Canada or that we used to to really hot out where where do you ... co\nWorker they breathe in the in the in the springtime worthy venture down south\nWhere do they fly through other way to and from just breeding grounds\nAware of the spots with these talks go and then where are we in most in need of putting habitat on the ground is an evolving science says something that we update constantly and be really use those types of maps those types of uh of analysis those types of of\nA science based research um to to see okay where on the ground should we do this worked you know which one of our partners fail fish and Wildlife Service or the Ohio division of wildlife now where do they have properties that we can do work on where there is some private lanes workers or is there a farmer who is\nRetiring and getting out of the business I was looking to sell his or her farm you know the opportunities right we will definitely by that farm\nAnd a resort back to about ... they handed over to chew on land conservancy or the state or the federal government for for management um you know working with private landowners is pretty important part of what we do so it's really the ... the one good answer German but\nWhere do we you know ... how do we determine that were to do the work ... that's part of part of a part of a on international a kit conservation plan but we have long since gone by here to you\n... do you have any idea how many acres of land use recouped\nHis a pretty sizable number of Mike so members of actual the actual knew it Chris on the ground and ... of North America a we have concern over fourteen million acres of habitat that does not include even\nThe work that we've gone back to and done so let's say for example there's there is a partner that would just give her a sample about who has a hundred acre farm but we're able to to buy it a fair market value and trip back into a wetland\nYou know if we ... visit that weapon began Twenty years later to help you to have them hats that that property again we don't count that so it's it's only new acres was fourteen million new acres\nDoesn't even include their work to go back to do to restore we've already done or someone else already done so it's a huge impact um we've done work in\nAll fifty states and we do work in Mexico and Canada because\nDucts don't no borders but you don't understand that they're much Chicago or Canada or Ohio now they if they care about finding the best ... habitat that they can be it'd be work how these states and uh we're pretty big impact on all these areas\nNow we're in a certain a fly way right the Ohio is\n... and\nYet you get you get the sheep blood but go ahead\nAnd I I guess here's what I'm going to lead to win a fly way\nWhat is the migration let's pick a ... what's the migration of the duck over a period of the year you know let's start out in January were they act in January\nSet on January to so it was both a multitude of ducks bases that were very fortunate to have a share in North America it really depends on the duck right now\nOver ... generally what we can say is um you know ducks will winter down in southern warmer habitats they go down there and they spend their winters either in Mexico the southern us or some mid latitude states and\nThey then come up to the north to to breed 'em and and and the spring\nSo the spring when they migrate to the north\nThey go into a number\nOf different spots but again it it depends on um the ducks um you know for let's say for example the the the\nBrother ... ... scale is one that we're seeing a lot more around the great lakes up lately been till winters anywhere from from the from the um large to cut us off\nDakota all went to Alaska that Laura Day I'm Sorry that's where that's where they breathe in the springtime but then they would they winter anywhere from Oklahoma down to Central America show these birds go across the whole continent which is which has a pretty amazing bird ...

to to generally categorized to Maine migration route for produce ducks and geese\nThey blend together they don't the depends on the weather depends on where they can find the best habitat they they kind of um you know blend those those gorgeous\nBut for the most part you gets real did you get ... fly along the Atlantic coast I'll sit down to the Mississippi Valley as well so you see a whole bunch of different types of species throughout the year\nAnd we pay attention to the fall migration that's been hunting is but the spring migration is really a pretty incredible time to go out there and actually observe birds as they make their way back north from food wintering grounds up up north though that ... year to get up there and do ... and and and greed\nAnd it's really neat way to get out the ... the springtime and the kind of get your fix about a duck some men and and the marsh habitat actually do some bird watching and actually ... the same time to send same boat lens as they were way back to Canada and in Michigan and you know the the the northern states do to their breeding\nDo any of 'em really use Ohio much for breeding I you know I've seen mallard or you know certain I don't know all the names of the the species that we have come in through but I Know mallard or one that I've seen many a times we'd see Ducklings a\nYou know or do they start hearing move their way up as a breed\nYeah no that definitely is a there definitely is um upbringing that happens airing those ballots are definitely one of those ones that that that to breed in Ohio and and what we're seeing more and I'm like which is pretty interesting as climate change happens\nWhere our biologist shore planning out these contributions projects or as as climate change happiness and it gets warmer
