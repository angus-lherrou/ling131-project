{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "That is right and if your listeners ever want to do a little research and find out you know where the wealthiest per capita city in America is where where they produce not saying it's Washington DC it's all the fat cats lobbyists and attorneys\nAnd and the folks that are down there working these deals\nThat basically screw main street and help Wall Street you know you want to take a Republican would be talking like this what you are 'cause I'm all in favor of capitalism but I'm not in favor of crony capitalism and that's what Nancy Pelosi and the whole Democrat weighing down there they have sold America\nOut they Johnson is our guest for Sony vale tile and of course I made a county party Republican chairman keeping in mind that I don't think there was a lot of support from Democrats or Republicans or the power structure in general\nFor Trump when he started to take on these trade agreements did you sense any overwhelming support from the politically people at all for him to take this on and he did it anyway\nYou know really almost nobody supported them down there they were all concerned about you know I understand the terrorists can be a two way street them you know China's starts putting tariffs on on products that they're shipping here and\nSo it can be a double edged sword in the early stages but but that's part of what it takes to get people to a table sometimes\nBut you know where he's tried Trump is using that to get a deal and that's where he's starting\nThat's where I think he started with the steel industry because that's a vital industry or even in terms of national security that we want to wipe out the steel industry in this country and then five ten years later have nothing here no sense of a super structure of the steel industry I'd be a very bad a\nOf action I think for the country\nRight he was worried about steel and aluminum and he uses terrorists ultimately a cynic oceanic two buddies concern now when you look see China as far as manipulating currency as far as dumping on our country as far as the patent infringement\nNo one was taking this stuff on prior to try now is focuses on China would you agree day that China needs us more than we need them because they need our marketplace now I think Trump is finally starting to say America stop acting like pat sees weren't driving the driver seat don't makes lousy deal such throw us\nSo it's a it's a ... right I think China's going to recognize that that that it's better to get a deal where everybody can do something have something in the ... work here and now that's going to happen it's going to happen it'll take a take a little bit more time but uh the only way they're going to come to the tables are quick\nOr some too and that's these these terrorists are going to do it\nAll right so I mean a lot of it seems to me Obama was\nWilling to write off manufacturing like it's a thing as a past Trump isn't willing to write that off he thinks it should return to our country and that's what he's working on and when you look as a businessman and as a citizen of the country as to where we are economically now\nAs a result of cutting regulations on what you're talking about cutting regulations and cutting taxes are in addition to\nAll the other stuff that Trump's son where the economy starts is soaring now\nWhile I don't think there's any question about it we we've got the ... with the tax cuts\nA billions hundreds of billions of dollars are going to go back into the private sector the economy that is why GDP is is we're more than double what it was under Obama we have a record low unemployment one of the part of the problem today is folks around with a hard time hiring people having a hard time first time\nWe're putting a we've got a big billboard out in front of our factory ... number one about half of the people to the young people can't pass a drug test\nSo that's that's a problem but nevertheless record unemployment or that we're seeing a\n... a record employment you mean we're seeing but don't you also think that can open the door to learn a lot more people to come into our country illegally I mean it was one of the arguments and he says we're going to build a wall that there's going to be a door in it because we are going to need some people that come in here\nAbsolutely I think will always be welcome to to having integration but it's got to be control to be controlled and\nAnd uh you know we probably got\nThey say there's eleven or twelve million uh undocumented citizens are probably closer to double that amount in this country and then a lot of them are doing work that frankly Americans both do we have\nWe have a big plant in Salem the the the meat packing plant mhm and ah I Know the folks that operate that facility and I know the owner the company\nAnd uh they're decent people they're good businessmen\nThere there's people that they have a heck of a hard time finding staff that will work in that kind of an environment that's not right on it in place because it's air conditioned and it's it's it's really\nUnskilled labor rights but they were able to find people that have a work ethic show up do a good job in our thankful to have a job how did we all know hundred\nEmployees there in a big percentage of them are Guatemalans and in our community leaders are good people in the community I see him around town and they've got young families their right mind citizens right should welcome the\nRights and in many cases as I understand it most of them are here legally incidentally so you know you can't make assumptions on a on all of this kind of stuff you want to say\nOn that plan so called with with ice came in and and I think they they took like a hundred or a hundred and fifty of them and all those people that that they talk there were I think like ten or twelve or Fifteen that we were undocumented\nRight the rest of them had a right to be here\nAnd said to go to work and it seems like many of the people who come here have the work ethic any American Dream like our our ancestors had when they came here I don't know why future generations just got so lazy you were making a point prior to my break here\nWhere we were ... we are talking about something that's troubling me a lot I'm fearful that this country\nHas a growing percentage of people that are becoming socialist didn't believe in socialism not what motivates us capitalism the answer can't be punished that guy takes from him these two productive it give it to this guy sitting on the porch talk about that\nWell I think especially young people um our colleges and universities that they are filled with left wing liberal professors\nThat want to teach one side of the equation and and they're being brainwashed these young people were being brainwashed into thinking that capitalism is unfair that it discriminates that only the rich get rich and everyone else's pork um that's nonsense\nAnd uh it's it's really a goes hand in glove with of thoughts about legalizing drugs today we're showing without Ohio issue one\nWhich were decriminalize some of the most addictive and dangerous drugs that are Bergman every community in in Ohio and in the country\nThey will take functional and call her friends and all which is ten times as we all know one of those ... basically a misdemeanor to be a disaster them even the smallest amount\nI mean I think you'd be out of your mind to vote for issue one\nWell screw you and your Cordray supports this uh you know I I Can't imagine that are in trouble with the Democrats it seems like they all have to stick together on every issue\nYou won't see him break when Exxon it both Sheri nice guy I Know he's a veteran of you've got a lot of good qualities but the problem with cherries is liberal is a way to do it every other Democrat leadership tells me\nHe's not a Jim Traficant guy on the other hand you got to here's a young business guy yeah whose family had been in business for a hundred years in this county in this valley I'd say I want to be on it but I look at myself as a citizen of the greater rally right and here's one here's a a decent guy\nWho came down and ran for the school board and probably Tony family down there it was very modestly for for ... means and there's been a Jimmy leader he helped turn around that school where they were in basically in bankruptcy and now the school back up on the street\nAnd this young and really get it and it's going to be valley\nRight he did an incredible job at school board in la tonia and he would be a ... breath of fresh air I think in in in that particular race you know I was\nGoing to Columbus to Republican folks I'm telling you he is a pro rally guy who's loyal to the valley in a show on that would represent every working family and this entire\nRegion is Danny Davis Mike ... says listen he might not be polish like other politicians that they talked about so great after a meeting maybe I'll take the on polish guy for a change that I'd love to\nTime in seven oak long shot by American source for fine art their brothers so now this news\nRadio five seven W jumps out [noise]\n[noise]\nMichelle Brandt and President Trump in an interview that Saudi Arabia will face severe consequences\nThat evidence shows the country is responsible for the alleged murder of Washington Post journalist Jim ... he was laughing entering the Saudi constantly in Turkey October second Turkish authorities said he had evidence he was tortured and killed inside the consulate\nHow you got to where you are today or why what what's driving by you and if you could share their story I'm sure well it it\nIt was birth that a lot of personal pain mhm and pain that my husband had years ago he had a severe osteoarthritis throughout his body at the same time I had five of my house yah\nRight so I was really on a quest to find something all natural to help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time\n... ... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that emu oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain\nI took a new oil and glucose ... mhm I use ... which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay realm Elaine that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic solver\nThat is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor\nIt's Greece list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain and death and irritate your skin\nGoes in Fifteen minutes later you have really\nSo that's why I'm here to share what I Know and show that I had\nRight because it was and I have this year by the way of folks glucose mean cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has pumped top on it\nTo ... to ... he'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay of pain of the nation that sanitary contamination so you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body then you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also rebuilding re read the rebuilding\nPart so how does that work once you apply that cream to that area that you're going to target ... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThat body heal itself provided you get it the raw materials that needs I'm giving you watch you made for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that's he'll okay\nAnd this is safe enough and then you have to worry about\nI have to worry about a thing if you're taking a drug for pain it won't conflict with that at all none of these in going is going to do that okay\nSo what what is then a a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you're going to notice that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminated okay and then over time you're going to rebuild and repair your joints with that inflammation being taken down that's going to restore flexibility and mobility and sleep I mean if you can sleep again\nThat's where our bodies get all of our recoup protests regenerative ability to heal\nAnd then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again traveling exercising so you can lose weight runny socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all of these are the things you your can't do or it's very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life for trying to live\nWell you can't you're right you're right live a normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taken care of and you can yeah\nAnd you've got people out there that are that are already getting great result\nTry and brought some more emails and letters

overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas and able to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nIt's a miracle and the two that truly does take away the pain it works is nothing else I'd ever tried it worked quickly and eliminated all of the pain\nSo to me now these are these\nYou do these kinds of responses unusual\nNow really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart good to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails or these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people had to use my great results\nThat's great [laughter] I don't want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there's a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred two one two four\nSeven eight seven as we've been talking about here Dr Janet's formula is

seven eight seven [noise]\nSo what do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that\nPerhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there are so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there but looking at it from a natural standpoint\nAnd Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue to have the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this is this is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this is good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme in is how minimal it is it's going to get you with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer take your pain from my pen to a five and ... on the line with continue to use ... mind telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well doctors in it\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried All right things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't\nWork first of all for ... for ... for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the airline industry here taking into early to three months people give up\nPeople in pain they won't release saying why now right and that I had developed this train again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's

executive director of the original agency form of honing Colombian to in trouble counties or Catholic charities welcome Nancy\nThank you for having me today\nI Know that our subject today is going to focus on domestic violence and before we get into our brief discussion on that tell us exactly what is domestic violence and what are some of those statistics that affect us here in the valley\nOkay so that's the violence can be any act of physical violence or\nAttempted physical violence against either family or a household member you don't necessarily have to be related but if you're in a household member of your calls ... usually between intimate partners is the prevalence and that can be everything from kicking pushing slapping\nRestraining someone pointing a weapon at than\nJust even threatening than the person doesn't necessarily have to have physical injuries or even ... seek medical attention but it can still be domestic violence it can also take into account things like threatening somebody\nIt's about power and control domestic violence is always something about controlling someone so even things like economic deprivation\nOr emotional abuse just intimidation up somebody anything that kind of holds that power or control over them\nAnd it sounds like it's kind of pervasive is our our world really when you think about it but let's focus on how pervasive it is it here in our local area\nIt is pervasive some of the national stats that I read where that twenty people per minute in the United states experience\nSome kind of physical violence that adds up Thomas ten million people a year in Columbia county in our area\nWe take over seven hundred crisis calls a year for domestic violence and we fear that that's probably under reported that people still we still try to get the message out so that people know to call for help we have a shelter that don't talk about and then at that we showed her over Seventy people a year but\nWe also help with almost two hundred and fifty to three hundred protection orders that people can get a year\nSo it's a very pervasive some steps that said that one in three women and one in four men have experienced that violence can't happen also to men we always many times it it appears that it's women that men also can be victims of domestic violence as well\nAnd told us about this specific program that's going on in one of the counties\nOkay our agency which you mentioned coverage and the hunting trauma Columbia county in Columbia county we operate Christina half Christine houses domestic violence shelter it's in an undisclosed location we can shelter women and children in that shelter\nAnd usually try to keep them up to thirty days and then develop some kind of plan for them either a relocation a new you know moving somewhere we've helped people relocate some times out of the area\nWe try to develop a safety plan with them if they do choose to go back to their home\nTo some kind of safety plan we also have a case manager that will help them with other issues we have a victim advocate who will go to court with them and help them with protection orders to sitting in court with them to be a support help them through the process and and work closely with the prosecutor's office\nWe also have an outreach education specialist who will come out\nShe goes out to schools groups churches anywhere to talk about everything from domestic violence to safe dating just those kinds of topics that relate to that so we have an education specialist and we work closely and the other counties with the other shelters specifically in hunting in Trumbull\nBecause every county does have some type of shelter Catholic charities happens to run the one that covers Colombian economy\nYou see this problem getting worse or are we trying to respond to it to make it less than\nWhat you hope that it lessens it seems like there's peaks and valleys some times throughout the year they always talk about around Superbowl time that there's a spike sometimes in the summertime it's hard to say it seems like it's more pervasive but you wonder if it's because people are more aware of it\nThere is a lot more attention that's given to the problem so people are trying to bring it out much more but the statistics are staggering\nIf someone wants some help who did they contact how do they reach out and where do they go\nIn Columbia county we have a hotline it is three three zero for two zero zero zero three six if you live in other counties you can call to one\nOne most counties are covered by two one one which is an information network there is also hired method violent hotline which is eight hundred nine three for nine eight four zero so there are those different avenues to call\nWill news void is we certainly appreciate your time on our show today but especially heightening the awareness of this big issue of domestic violence\nAnd we certainly encourage folks with us if they are aware of anything like that police contact Catholic charities or contact who won one to get more information so you could be helped him they can be helped thank you thank you for white skin I for the gym

Caribbean has just been wonderful and helping me get to the show started\nSo uh we're going to lean on them and keep moving forward here\nSo everybody who's willing to make the effort can be noticeably healthier beginning today\nThe greatest thing about my view of health which is correct by the way I don't want to sound arrogant but I Do know this stuff and I know what makes us healthy in the great thing about it is it truly cost you nothing to achieve the best health you've ever known in your entire life\nAnd no it's not a magical cream that you rub on or a magical vitamin that you take that I'm saying is going to make you healthy you know what I'm telling you is if I sat with you\nTo face I Would tell you in all honesty this is what will make you healthy\nIt's free but it's not easy it takes effort and if you're willing to do it the long term in the long term the results are there every time every time that's how we're designed\nWe are designed in accordance with the laws of nature and the laws of physics on this earth that dictate everything every function on the earth\nAnd when you work with in those laws\nThen good things happen because everything works more efficiently and smoke a flows more freely and so for us I can tell you assuredly it's really only the foods you eat in a tiny bit of exercise that make the difference\nYou know if you want to do more exercise that's fantastic if you want to be athletic I Love it do it but feed your body right because if you're athletic and you don't feed your body right there's going to be a price to be paid somewhere down the line it's not simply a matter of just burning off what you eat it's not that simple\nSo if you want to be athletic I encourage you to feed yourself healthy as well and you will achieve better athleticism and you will have fewer breakdowns along the way I often see these NFL players and baseball major league baseball players and things\nAnd these guys have injuries that they really probably don't have to have it has a lot to do with the issue elasticity in your body muscle and tendon elasticity and the way you eat determines how good those cells function and how well they hold together in extreme athletic competitions\nAnd I think about these guys and I think how many of them if they adopted a better diet would excel without injuries\nAnd I I think I don't know this but in the future I'm going to talk of I just want to find out more a Tom Brady is a great example of that you know whatever you think of him he's a incredible quarterback incredible athlete guys like forty years old and he's still functioning at the really highest level that you can\nSo if you feed your body right great things happen and that goes for you and me to the uh retired mill workers a retired construction worker retired secretary truck driver I don't care what you did for a living if\nYou and I don't care how old you are the body is forgiving and it can always use\nBetter health we could all use better health whatever our level of health I feel that mine is it starting to peak I'm getting to a point where I Know day in day out that my health has improved dramatically over the years I really want to share that with you\nSo if you listen to me and we'll go through this year a little bit and you'll get some tidbits every Sunday I Wish I could deliver the whole thing in one why do actually\nEat more fruits of eat all fruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds and berries and things as I Do with only a occasional excursions into food you shouldn't eat\nAnd you will thrive that's all the risk to it a little bit of exercise helps for you and I that means you know walking every day or every other day at least every day is really best\nYou need a little bit of exercise to stoke the fire\nAnd I walk really anywhere between two and three miles a day had a kind of a rapid pace not real fast but that's kind of what I think it takes to stoke the fire and keep my body burning at a higher level\nSo if you're willing to make the effort [noise] I freely teach you everything you need to know each Sunday so let's get started here I'm going to try to buzz through a few things yesterday it's amazing to me or how everything I Do I seemed to see some kind of relationship to people's health [laughter]\nSo ah yesterday I was flushing out my water heater if you can imagine that and uh in preparation for winter my a water heater not only heats our ... our water and dish water and washing machine water but also heats our house I've I've set up a radiant heat system when I built our house\nAnd um it works actually quite well but it does help to keep the water heater working efficiently\nAnd yet it's not this isn't hasn't turned into a house care show but there is a relationship between how your water heater works in its efficiency and you give them a body and that's what I Hope to get to hear in a roundabout way if you're willing to be patient\nSo if you're not aware of it or we have quite a few minerals in our water especially in this area but really all the way through the east coast down through the Appalachians high mineral content in the water and uh probably has to do with the limestone in the ground but\nWhat happens in your water heater is as that water is heated the ... the minerals that are in a diluted in the water and actually dissolved in the water precipitate out as a cheated and they'll settled to the bottom ... bottom of your water tank your water heater\nAnd what that does is several different things one is when it accumulates on their it decreases the area of the water has to be in contact with the\nMetal where the heating takes place [noise] [noise] an excuse me and uh so that decreases the efficiency of your water heater so with less surface area to contact the water it it takes longer to heat\nAnd other things happened too as well like your your faucets and you're a showerhead they get kind of a minerals build up on it and all and by the way easy thing to do with that is to take a shower had offered the faucet screens and soaked goes in white vinegar and it dissolves off quite well\nBut the water heater itself has commonalities with the human body in that it's an energy conversion system and so are we believe it or not you know we eat food and the higher quality food we have the more efficient that conversion is into heat in energy to do work\nThat's all all energy conversion systems do they consume energy and they produce either heat or work or both and the human body is really good at that and uh it's a kind of a complex thing unless you look at each little chemical reaction each one's really simple but taken together\nAll the reactions work to really mobilize mobilize an animate this incredible thing we called the human body\nSo just like a water heater that can lose its efficiency when the quality of the water is poor or if it's a gas water heater the quality the gas is poor\nAnd then as it burns you get carbon build up and\nYou know the head of the ah the ah heat exchange or in their stores to carbon up and things like that then that decreases efficiency in your body when you eat things that we are really not designed to eat meats and cheeses and sugars and things like that we actually build up residue in the blood\nAnd in some organs like the liver and the gall bladder and things and we used in the liver with um one of the fastest growing diseases in the country right now which is non alcoholic fatty liver disease\nAnd if you drink alcohol that problem is compounded\nBut delivers the filter of your blood and as that starts to build up some of these toxic waste products in it the liver becomes less efficient at doing his job and that he has a trickle down effect on the rest of your health\nYour blood is not Clinton's as well and sometimes we ended up with a lot more triglycerides may be floating around our body were a lot more cholesterol floating around our body because the liver couldn't do his job as efficiently\nThat truly is why we see the uh diseases of aging as we call them and they have a tiny but to do with aging but they have a lot more to do with the way we feed our body over the years\nWhen we feed it efficiently it it can consistently perform efficiently over the years with few breakdowns few illnesses things like that\nIf you work at feeding the body efficiently you can maintain a higher level of efficiency\nAnd here's the really exciting thing folks\nIf you're like me and you spent most of your life doing things wrong and you polluted your body and your body is broken down at times which mine has and I've told you in the past about my sixteen episodes of kidney stones or Seventeen or every two years I Would ever kidney stone that was a result of feeding my body poorly\nAnd whether you're fifty sixty Seventy eighty\nYou know that times going to come and it it's pretty powerful stuff to have that comfort knowing that God is air and I can't wait to ask God some questions are kind of technical stuff but a little we'll be back in a short time thank you for listening\n[noise]\nFrom

you want to call\nThe number seven to nine nine nine seven seven seven to nine nine nine seven seven if you have a question please keep it tight and concise and the way we can move on maybe get a couple of more calls and right now I'm going to talk to Aaron from Youngstown\nHello Aaron ... there are\nQuestions you mix religion and science and I know the early scientists used Christian they manage my question for you is\nOne is a lock them up and maybe some of the ... thing and the other one is I was listening to a part gas in some of the new trainers and some of the new fitness\nAnd they are talking more about moderation in training\nLike you know the old days you know you work out as an talking more than the parents you just breaking your body and that's a\nGood points thanks Aaron all all hit both of those now thank you so uh yeah let's talk about fasting real quick I haven't gotten into fasting I'd do fast myself\nAnd uh it's a risk of making all think I'm Crazy I have fasted a couple of times for Twenty one days on just water\nAnd uh it's actually a very healthful thing but it's also something very powerful and needs to be understood I've read extensively on and I did many short fast before I did along fast and I can tell you that it is are breaking down process in the body\nAnd uh it should be respected as such and it's not for the light hearted\nYou I think everybody should fast I typically fast one to two days a week now um and I find it to be very healthful\nYou can do many of the same things simply by adhering to a good diet a very good diet in your body can perform very well that way and fasting may not be necessary but it can be a powerful thing and I encourage you though if you think about fasting read extensively on it and understand that\nBecause especially if you have a disease and advanced disease uh you better understand it free get into it because that is possible with anything you do in you could take a vitamin and kick off the more you don't know how things will react in your body we kind of know across the board how most things react\nBut there's no guarantees hey folks life is dangerous you know in general and when you put pills into your body I I Know many people that have developed pretty significant and severe symptoms from medications and I have seen people react to vitamin D supplements\nAnd so you know the less variable you put into that whole picture of the better off you are but be cautious\nThe thing about the trainers in moderation in training I Believe is probably very accurate\nI see these young people that I watch the television program once about a a kid that was going to play college football and this kid wanted to put weight on fast he was drinking a court of all of oil a day in order to put on weight my God\nWho ever came up with that advice you know it's no wonder we see these young athletes dying on the football field or on the basketball court or on the soccer field your body can only be pushed so far and then it's going to push back or it's going to quit\nAnd so you really need to work within\nThe limitations that were given in that training thing the moderation training I think makes so much since then when we see athletes get hurt because there are over trained they're like race horses that have been tweaked to the to the nth degree door they perform at their highest ability\nBut they break down very easily too and so we have to be cautious about that you know speaking of that I read an article\nThe other day about a neurologist that thinks he can solve the football players getting concussions\nAh with the new type of equipment or something\nHey there is no no helmet that is going to save your brain if you understand the anatomy of this goal in the brain and how it's based in a fluid and yet it has allowed the brain can sloshing around in the head I don't care what kind of helmet you put on it\nIf you impacts so many you know going full speed and you do that over and over and over there is going to be drained Bain Ida excuse me brain damage and that's just a fact of the laws of nature that that's never going to change you can't fix that and then you put on top of that many\nThese are highly trained athletes that use steroids and might be into recreational drugs and things like that and they eat a diet very rich in animal fat which slows your micro circulation down in diminishes the healing ability of the brain when it is\nInjured then we have a kind of a noxious mix there and you put a knee injury on top of that and you have trouble so I that's my opinion\nBut I think we need to uh you know that whole moderation thing I think is a great thing I see a lot of athletes I ever young athletes I've had young athlete says patients who have
