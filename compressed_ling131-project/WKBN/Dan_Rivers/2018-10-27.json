{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "[noise] the fact that the steel had are found that shallow means that may be planer boards or my come into play\nAh yes I Do use playing their boards you only sometimes if I'm trolling the break laws I Do they use them only on the outside away from the wall\nOr one of the key thing for me is trolling tied to the wall because the steel head we use the wall is an ambush point for the day fishing push 'em to the wall so you want to get close to the wall mhm\nNow that would make me think you would want to run a planner board on the wall side so that the boat is out and not spoken the fish and you can work that bow to keep that planner board parallel with a with a ...\nAh I have done that\nBut I found it like if say there's two people with me I could put out for a ... get him to lines in between the vote in the wall\nAnd maybe get the one of the other ones off the other side that you got three pretty close to the wall and if you want to run a board and see if they're out away from the wall you could run away but if you use a forward to going to start pushing you away from the wall a little bit\nBut you know some types of the wall is the other day and every day it's you know you work on things until you figure it out\nYeah right job if you're alone angler if you're just fishing by yourself you could [noise] okay when you're fishing by yourself do you use it gives you only get did you write used player boards on each or do you do you draw on straight off flat line\nA flat line and like I said sometimes I'll\nIf things are getting a little tough and I'm not catching as many as I think I should be catching some\nI may throw board out and see if the if the boat is spooky women and that has happened to have put them out and I have caught on the plane or boards you know\nMhm or just different things that I've tried\nSo what'd you ... you know what's a good day for you been in the past week or so what's you know what kind of numbers we're looking at\nWe've been averaging anywhere from Fifteen to twenty a day\nOr in the in the net or on on the floor\nIn the net wow what kind of side\nUh this year seems to be down a little bit we seem to be more in the four and five um\nRange and you do get some sevens in age but uh you know in the past you know your average may have been six to eight this year seems to be down a little bit of a lot of four and five\n[noise] All right and you you practice ... you let the steel he'd go\nYeah strictly catch and release\nAll right do you guide 'em up other people\nNo I Do but I Do have a a a lot of friends and stuff and I do work with them and they worked with me you know a couple of is\nThat we do kind of network and there's actually two other guys going to be out here with me today and in that way a as we're trolling if we're catching fish on certain things we communicate with each other what's working what's not working\n[noise] All right and what's been working ...\nA little why lately ah you orange in the ... orange and gold a\nSharp truce in greens have been working very well\nUm what's down cranked huh and these are crank ... correct a\nAnd using stick base like\nThe other day we came or we started out in the morning the first\nTwo hours in the morning I was using bay rats joined ... and some others dictates and they were working excellent all sudden about two hours into the day they shut off and I started going the stones and we went right back to catching fish or go\nBack and change that fast [noise] well ... what changed I mean were you able to perceive anything in terms of sunlight or or wind or a current or anything that made him turn off on the cranked and onto the spoons\nOr the one thing is is the son did come out after about two hours All right you started out the mall and cloudy and\nThen when the sun popped out things kind of seem to change and then when I made changes it worked out for the best\nWe are talking to Jon breed led by the way he uh he frequency or the concrete correct yes okay um but the tactics that you're talking about a can be used wherever the primary six tributaries in northeast are that are are stocked with steel that feed into Lake Erie\nYes I I have gone over to the grand river I have fish to ask you if you look and everything that I Do work in both of them are Evers\nYeah a buddy of mine Doug Stewart he's a frequent guest on the show he's been over at the grand in uh been doing quite well and steel that as well as small mouth bass he sent me some photos of some really large momma God there are thrown in the same thing doing that trolling frankly it's but you can also um go up river and cast of these fish correct\nYes uh I have a friend who loves to or if we're catching them pretty good in an area he will actually stop and he'll start cast neither spoons or spinners and he's pretty good at it\nOkay do you ever is anybody ever fly fishing for these things up they're awful boats\nYes they are there is a ... a friend of mine who does guide\nAnd he goes come up and they do use streamers a white one they use a shark truce ones and they will use firearms or they were just hear the other day and they were doing pretty good on him\nOr they actually casting or they trolling with lies their capital with them\nThat'd be fun as heck how about the um uh you know ... ... for the short bound anguish for the for the folks who don't have boats or just don't want to deal with it um is there a good reason for success\n[noise] uh yeah there is the ... you have the ah west wall\nThey can go out on the west wall or they can actually ah in the harbor area there's a wall there they can fish from or upstream there is a um the launch ramped it's on the river you can cash from that area up there\n[noise] okay [noise] um and when the weather allows you can get out beyond the brick wall and and still find fish\nYeah I mean I Would prefer to be out on the wall or you you do a lot better out there\nBut uh the weather lately has not cooperated with uh the last two weeks or I don't know if I've been out there yet in the last two weeks\nAnd then I thought what kind of lines and what kind of speed are we talking in a drawing for these fish um\nI'd say right now when the water's kind of warmer to point one on your GPS\nWorks pretty good mhm how to point one to two point five somewhere in there and then there's the water cools down and get to the lower fifties or in the forties or whatever it may slow down to one point eight\nOkay and I think you how you sort of have a trick two inches of water clarity did you use\nOne of the things especially in the lake if you can't see the ... you have very good day\n[laughter] okay so when you're when you're on board motors is tilted all the way down and you just look over the transom and if you can see your propeller um ... the clarity is conducive to catching fish\nYes are still have they'll come anywhere from ten\nFeet down to come up to hit a spoon but if if it's somebody they can't see them you know unless you get it right past their nose and not going to the\nUs yeah All right are there are ways to avoid that in other words can ... you know at the laundry hamper maybe and maybe to turban to catch fish do you just go up river downriver or go find clear water if it's if it's not clear there it's pretty much not clear wherever you want to fish\nAre there are times were uh and that's one nice thing about it you know the smaller boat you do have options\nYou know if you can't fish to like because it is money then you can't come into the the slippery if the slippery is not a good\nWhen you can always have the river so there are multiple options especially with the smaller boat\nUm where folks are are you having something that otherwise and you know ten Fifteen Years ago\nThey wouldn't have even known somebody walked across the property so the amount of calls is probably I Would say higher continues to get higher because the reality is we're getting more and more properties in the county\nAnd you know we're getting more and more technology in the fields you know a lot of these trail cameras now are very very well camouflage they can be mounted at much higher angles a better since Tuesday so we're getting a lot more information a lot more data in and so that's I Would say\nOn paper or the complaints it went up but it you know I think sometimes is a little bit misleading 'cause in reality we have a somewhat fewer people in the field to\nYeah that is a situation and I I Know when we were talking a little bit prior to that um uh the number of hunters and an outdoorsman and women are is on the decline in its its sorry to see that that happening um do you have anything in particular you would attribute that to\n[noise] well I mean you know I I think ah when you start looking at let's say for example the model that that our agency is looked at um we're somewhere in the ballpark of the license sales we saw in Nineteen twenty eight um which is you know anybody looks at that bell curve are like wow that's that's\nReally you know a hard thing to look at you know during the population in the state of wires continue to\nTo search job board we you know we have\nAbout eleven million people in the state of Ohio in less than two million by hunting license or fishing licence or anything like that so\nBut that that the take away their that I think it's really important for a lot of folks to to take a look at is you have to note\nThat a lot of our our sportsmen are from the baby boomer generation and so those folks are aging out there they're into the reduced license cost so that's a factor but many of them also in that age now where they they're they're experiencing mobility concerns meaning they're they're hitting long term care or\nYou know they're they have heart disease or have a lot of those are\nThings that come with age that are limiting and that is really beginning to show up and I think that's going to even show up even more um as that generation continues to to slide across the the age graph so\nI'm as as far as the overall you know piece of the puzzle I Would say it's going to look worse in another ten years probably exponentially so we're getting old\nA ... baby boomers you know ... and it's ... you are you hit the nail on the head you know ah me I'm ... I'm sixty seven\nAnd ... you know at the ... the joints don't move as easy as they used to get up in the morning you know and and all the years that I've been wrenching out there in the cold in the hands get at the hands don't move as good as they used to you know and so you're right it it's not as easy to get out there and do what we do\n'em all the years that I I used to enjoy getting out there hunting and fishing and that sometimes get in that boat at isn't as easy as as you see so you are correct in that\nBut what happened to the next generation you know I mean I\nI I took my boys out in in we've we shot that\nUh we used to really enjoy thrown the old clay pigeons and shoot you know we did some hunting and fishing but you're you're right in the fact that they really didn't fall up they don't fish and like I Do uh like I did and uh it sorry to see that happen but yeah you're right about the baby boomers [laughter]\nWell I think uh some of that has to do with with the ideology of how we're raised I mean it was the space of\nA year generation is kids you know you grew up working outside and uh you know my generation ... the majority of them you know they grew up playing outside\nAnd now today's generation is they just don't go outside because they have all the technology in the world and and you know you you you drive down the street and now you you really like a lot of um you know the urban areas that I work uh when I Do follow up investigations and stuff\nUsed to be you know Twenty years ago you see kids all over in the street doing stuff you know they have a basketball's a hoop out the edge of the road and it'd be playing in the street or whatever you say that are anywhere you know and so you know those are just reflections of the time and you know and that's going to continue to play out so to have to\nYou know I hate to say except it man and kind of try to manage for it as a way to say it\nBut as what I see it difficult about that is based upon what I Know about\nOur hunting and fishing in the area is so much of that is promoted and supported by the the hunting license and the fishing licence and with the decline in that ah you know that's going to decline in what\nYour department can do for us well yes I mean here's here's that there's two fold things here that they're having 'em one you know obviously license sales does have correlation there agency\nMade a move this year where there was the right move or not you know I'm not gonna you know debate that speculate that I mean it's not what my role is was inform educate and obviously enforce the law but\nThey made an effort to try to get some more revenue captured and uh they offered multi year licenses lifetime licenses or variety of things there which is again it's a great a promotion too many people like the convenience of being able to buy for several years and not have to worry about buying again you know your license run out and all that stuff\nBut the bigger problem is is we have a centrally an infusion of cash now you did not translate to a a long term solution and so as this baby boomer um spectrum moves across\nThere really only promoting the you know prolonging the inevitable and it's going to be in my opinion that much more of a substantial drop off when it drops here so they you know I think there's going to have to be some hard decisions made about a a lot of the things within\nA what we call the north America model wildlife conservation just you know where we're sportsmen I've paid our way they they were the ones that make all this happened and I think that's a key component to the you know what we've gotten more we've gotten because\nYou know when you pay for something you appreciate it more than something that you're given married and uh that's one of the values that that many of our conservation is done very very well with our with our model you pay to play centrally in because you pay to play you you have a you know you have a voice in what happens I'm\nIn I think that that model has worked very well but now we're to that point where\nUh you know the players or the participants have have suddenly lost you\nLost their numbers he now we have to figure out\nHow do we get a from where we're at now to twenty fifty because you know on the plane we're going right now I'm we're going to have some serious concerns and problems here over the next ten to Fifteen Years near and it's not just the the revenue side it's the\nAh social awareness about uh the value of hunting you know a lot of our constituents when I go out and I'll be talking to someone who's\nA talking about you know hunting or whatever and I said do you do you recognize you ever browse line and they look at me and they have no idea what I'm Talking to you know obviously those are important things you know to understand that we have to do a better job of educating people\nUm you know a common thing I get is you know or have somebody who's moved to the country recently and they'll call and complain and say you know there's guys poaching back barrier shots all the time it's crazy you know what what do we what are you doing I'll go out and work it and I'll find out it's just somebody that's target shooting\nYeah do you know people moved to the country and they don't ah understand her say that it's okay to shoot a gun in the country it does not mean because some of the shooting a gun that they're doing something illegal the I'm In that again is is you know a lot of the challenge we have is people\nPeople who lived in an urban area they lived in a housing development or whatever they finally by a piece of property out in the country\nOr for their slice of heaven away from everybody and they expect a do you have total quiet in you know a lot of people who you know by laying in the country to do different thing being in a you know we have to learn to respect that the house so\nMany times I see in some of our publications or outdoor publication Joe they're offering land purchase for hunting and a lot more clubs a lot more individuals have have gotten together so that they can secure some of this property to hunt\nAnd you know I mean that's something that we need to do as as sportsmen we need to protect our our area so we can enjoy the sports the legally enjoyed the sports that we do and you are correct in in you know people moving out to the country where my shop is at north Lima you know two three houses away\nYou know it's the it's like a lot of uh you know areas where there's there's joint usage activity mhm um and I've seen this and look for example the some of the wildlife area that's on the bottom end or public hunting areas on the bottom into like Milton they have the bike path in their\n... and so a lot of folks are in their moving around there's human scent being moved around in there and ah it's actually kind of almost worked in the favor the hunters because the deer and\nNot as alarmed by the human scent and then makes a lotta sense sometimes we got to work together to outweigh absolutely [laughter] uh let's take a short break I'm only valley sports and and the great outdoors sponsored
