tomorrow afternoon humid with a high up around Seventy nine degrees and uh\nUh Travis does or does the weather mean anything do you do you do being worried about the weather\nYou know just just a little bit of practice throughout the week is as we go along you have to worry about it a little bit but not too much going into the game plan so\nYeah it was nice to meet you um I guess you're from

that's kind of what brought me Youngstown great program and everything and that's that's what got me up here so\nYeah well I guess that's where it hurts so much is that we we all feel we have a great program and we we just had a tough season so far heavily\nWe were you know we really have had some struggled but you know I I think our guys are working hard to try and turn it around and and I think hopefully we'll we'll see that pay off your\n... if you if you do you think are talent is comparable to the league I mean do do we have as good players as North Dakota and South Dakota South Dakota state et cetera I mean do we have to tell it here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then kick off is tomorrow night at six o'clock should not be a weather factor up there I'll detail that forecast in just a couple of seconds here all news radio five Seventy WKBD at ... big along here this morning it's friday morning it's chilly though forty eight degrees right now [noise]\nThe news do you want to know [noise]\nThat ... is that after I hit him with Tony staffing and kill the\nStay in the know five Seventy WKBD in\nHere is the forecast grow up to you by ... cigar box in Gerard [noise] cloudy cooler with a high today of sixty eight mile loaded da dum la da dum de partly sunny in eighty one other copious ratio or\nIf anybody's going to motivate you it's it's going to wind up being a built in jak I think\nOh my God yeah it it it's uh it's amazing uh on how they continue to have good teams there do they just basically um did they have something in the water they say in New England\nThey say it's the system that ah the way ... runs things you can put anybody in what was that a few years ago when Brady missed most of the season and they brought in and and tried 'em\nAnd I tried to back up and I can't think of the guy's name off the top of my head because he played for the Vikings awhile but here's the here's the thing when the guy was in New England he did great and then he went back I think he went to Kansas City first and many tanked\nAnd then he came to Minnesota any tank so he's taking average players and getting them into a system and motivating to play above their abilities\nSo what do you do with the judge or did you come in here and he has a history of drug abuse and uh you know not showing up for meetings and not not following and then you go into the ... system and all of a sudden you become a a guy that's productive on the field yeah unbelievable what are you what the bill Belcher I can do\nBut it it drives me crazy I'm so sick of the patriots and I'm so sick Brady and I'm so I as you get a big game coming up is in the Philadelphia play in Minnesota this upcoming here I think it's a Sunday afternoon I Believe you know I'm looking forward to seeing and that I'm looking forward\nTo seeing 'em a cartoon ... to see how we always recovered and ... you know he he's almost like a big ban is hard to hard guy to knock down\nI I've got a banner day coming up this Sunday because not only that I got the Vikings and the eagles is the late game\nBut ah earlier in the afternoon\nI'm Liverpool is going to host Manchester City so I'm going to get the double up so it's going to be one right after the other I'm going to be a happy boy on Sunday you'd be sitting there with your experts there was one which one is from Great Britain to right yes exactly but there'll be six of us for the liberal game but then the place builds up for the Vikings game because we all go to oh you're okay you're in very good\nUm this is interesting because we're going to have the uh the first game of the playoffs on this afternoon here or one thirty seven\nOr not everybody's going to love that because you're only going to hear an hour and a half of rush but we're going to have the Indians or one thirty seven is they take on the Astros and the biking we did get the gym Rosen how ... how this was all going to go down\nAnd we're going to be playing some day games here on the Monday game that's the only game is guaranteed because I mean the right that's ... or the Astros could sweep and you have three three to five yeah but that Monday games will be a one o seven game but why do seven pre game one thirty seven first pitch yeah\nI bet they're supposed to do listen to this folks this is a listen to this this is in Nineteen Twenty one were able to pull off this audio here\nOf the world series was broadcast for the first time on the radio between the New York giants and the New York Yankees and I'm a clip from the newsreels that we're able to glean from Nineteen Twenty one on this day of playoffs\nLike Yankee Stadium the sixty thousand fans in the family and the American league and the New York giants won [laughter]\nHow are you talk like that you know is it that people just didn't know how to react to radio and talk normally I've seen it does seem a rat that announcer wait one more time to just listen to what you would have to do here although I think you might be able to do this voice here\nHere in New York Yankee Stadium where at New York Yankee Stadium all you gotta just be palaces fans what sixty thousand bans and beginning in the NBA between the Yankees they hitting champions of the American league and the New York giants and the New York giants National League\nPennant winners all you got to do ... you can do that yeah that that's not my favorite you know I prefer the the ... version of that you know hey they're swinging guys and get people that do crash bad then light Joe's hari Krishna all your groovy freaks\nAnd then we spent the next forty years trying to work that out of every announcer in the world that fought that that's the way you're supposed to talk\nIf we tried to do the whole show Todd ... announcer if we tried to do the whole show like that how long do you think before we would have peasants with pitchforks and torches surrounding the building where there's this guy named cousin Brewster you work in\nWABC back in the Nineteen sixties and seventies and actually he's still doing a retro show right now and that he may he he made a living out of doing that hey this guy in Galveston cousin mostly you know um and then we tried initially you know what people don't actually talk that way\nUp I'd it's kinda funny I I'm a student all these voices here is another one we gleaned this is from Nineteen forty seven a Viking see if you remember this Nineteen forty seven this was the first time that a president actually spoke on TV\n[laughter] does he ever existing\nIts commitments in several\nIn the case of grace turkey is to have the United\nStates messed supply for\nThat\nAnd do what he was referring to um he ask Americans to stop eating meat on Tuesdays and chicken on Thursdays\n[laughter] meatless Tuesdays yes yes yes Harry Truman went on national television folks and ask Americans to stop eating meat on Tuesdays and chicken on Thursdays in an effort to stockpile food for starving people in Europe\nNot ... the first thing that I Would think about is the ... is is this just a way to rally people together\nIn a war effort here being that we're at the end of the war no here um this is Nineteen forty seven\nAnd a lot of this was inspired wall so you have to realize that there were still a lot of starving people so I think a large part of a humanitarian but\nHe's referring to Greece in there and a lot of people don't realize that there was a civil war that went on in Greece it started\nBefore World War two was even over and lasted into the late forties and we actually had to deploy some American troops I think they sense of Marines over there to help the British get it contained so there's your spread of communism the Truman was worried about you know\nJust should've had here who ah twenty Eighteen and your picture Donald Trump or going on national television I Want you to stop going to Taco Bell on Thursdays and give up [laughter]\nI Want you to stop going is don't eat any meat on Fridays we're going to go the Catholic way can you imagine and they are blessed are the uptake of this\nWell not because I think all the years that are on board with him would probably do it [laughter] yes we would yes we would act more tacos for me ... that's why I was kind of hope but he wouldn't win because uh I was promised a taco truck on every corner if he got beat and I love tacos\nThere's something about how the food trucks around here you wouldn't think that there's that many young stone but um they're able to bring these taco\nOr bring these trucks together at various things and people will need all these trucks so you got like ten trucks that they can rally real quick my good friend Dan has a food truck oh does he really it's called the sandwich there must be more out there then we actually thought about ... it's ... it's really going there's some really good ones around the area to you know why I Love it\nAll right it is the five Seventy W give you an Denver's

let's go to Glen our first call to the gate here on oh by the way I just just one little programming note uh everybody the calls today is going to get a citizenship question because I bike yeah I just found out that just a third or the I'm a I'm going to prove that um our audience is really smarter\nOne third of Americans can pass the U.S citizenship tests so we'll start with Glenn here Glenn uh my first question for you\nWho is in charge of the executive branch\nDonald Trump\nThere you go the press a dark so see I'm proven already my audiences are smart and so the next next fall to give the next question what's on your mind what chapter write\nWell actually a Donald Trump and a Nobel object when I told by my topic yeah kind of charcoal which I Would argue that there's quite a a similarity between those two gentleman\nUm or they give you a survey to hundred people if they like Bill Bela ... you know what they're feeling was on bill bell attract you could either say a lot of them\nDon't really care paid him there would be nobody in the I don't care group you either love him or hate him yeah same with Trump he gets um you know Bela truck picks up Josh Gordon and uh put plugs them into the system\nYou know Donald Trump go through a lot of people in those ... shouldn't but he he plugs man it's going to be my way or the highway\nA and I get I'll tell you what I Am not a Bill Belichick thin but if I had a thousand dollars to bat or I Would put and I could pick any team I Would put my money on his team because he is a proven winter and I just think that those two guys uh\nYou know you at first glance you think about\nWhat do you think what one of these do but you know where they're not\nThey were there are people out to they say the Trump really is a kind of like you know a tireless worker\nAre probably a big tail and and they say the bill ... check you know same thing you spend so much time in New England that they make sure that everything is going over but I don't know if that works for everybody because there's a lot of coaches out there that try to work hard but they don't get it done somehow Bill Belichick um has that innate quality that he demands that from people\nRight right and I'm being a coach myself I realize that but uh and there's there that's not to say that's the only way to be successful I mean take Jim travel Limbaugh night you know got is different night and day but both very successful very successful\nCoaches coming from different styles but while you know and I have somebody that you're a successful yeah but you know there is successful\nI Would think you would want to ride them for all their work but I Wish that the people would realize that on on the president\nYeah it would let me ask you you know I've heard and I'm a fan of bows and um you know he continues essays building up a different culture at Youngstown State you don't have to identify who you are but you said you're a coach ... how important is that that you build a culture in the people know what you expect does that translate into winning as far as your as your history as a coach\nI think it does yes and uh and winning and winning and success aren't necessarily center names\nUm but I think that I think that that culture has an effect on on both of them you know it still comes down to woody Hayes and you've got to have the horses but um but I think that's I think culture and tradition and and that is um is very very ... paramount factor on that\nYet and you see that and build ... ... by the way you see you see someone you emulate as a coach\nOr a ... ah well they say I'm not really a a fan of goes but uh I I think that uh you know you have to have your your your core beliefs and and if if if you don't believe that they're going to be that\nThose things aren't going to be successful then certainly your your players and you're a fan base aren't aren't going to believe it you know your wishy washy and um you know you certainly can't that's certainly not a magic do you can use about the president\nSo you know and then then you translate this the Trump to and you go back and you see a his success so far at least with the economy and of course is not all his but I just got a note this morning that the unemployment rate has fallen below four percent now\nSo yeah they said three seven on your hunger nine o'clock news here and\nYou know um [noise] who would who would think that that could be a you know could be possible yeah if you look you know there are a lot of those you know we've got a\nVery Frank with the Indians you know he's come in and installed the system and lots of successful systems but you're you're crazy when you have something that's work and that you want to you know you want to change that you know let's let's fire the successful person then let's go back in the pool and see what we might come up with\nMe I mean I think that's what I've always thought about too you know even with the radio broadcasting or anything you try to find some kind of a system to take the variables out of things so you can repeat it so you can get on to do any better things you know you you try to try to set up some system and now you after you've got that basic set up then you you don't have to go back and remake it every day\nExactly exactly you know there\nAre a coach good to have you are you are you still active\nYes I Am All right\nWell good luck to you if you're playing tonight and I thank you very much for calling\nThank you very much pressure\nThank you very much air raid our next next question here for our citizenship test today I just came across this and I just made an executive decision I'm going to prove that to our audience really\nThey are smarter than the average merely

school not allowing to leave the house\nThe Bette Midler saying this in her privileged life here in the United states she then had to go back and says well I gather\nOffended many by my tweet women are the et cetera is a quote from your co owner Nineteen Seventy two\nBut Bette Midler set it and here's Bette Midler a life of privilege nothing like that going on in the United states say for this

K. being right now we're going to tick or we're going to move over to pick nation and Steve boots and a Steve always brings us some good information we five of the NFL coming up and\nHere he is the man and the Steve tell people a little bit about what you do first of all\nThat we do the hardest thing in the world we make gamblers come losers in the winter it's not an easy job we work at it every single week it's not foolproof but at the end of the day we do the best that we can\nSo you've got to pick nation and do you get some free things which I'm getting right now but you can also sign up and get some ... other things that you charge people for\nAbsolutely we have three picks me of a tax the video we do we do a lot of video or video centric I'm at the same time we give out all the free picks for all the ... and then we give out those special winters to one game on a Sunday that is what we call our best bet and those we charge for\nA ride you're gonna find him a pick nation dot com pick nation dot com All right let's start with our favorite team here at the Cleveland Browns in Baltimore Ravens\nRight well the browns they should've beat the raiders last week we all know that they let that game slip away but gamblers out there I wouldn't underestimate the dog pound this week I'm going to go with the browns plus two points I don't know that they win but I Do believe that they get the cover at home\nDoing it and so what do you got three ...\nThree Baltimore's three total forty five and a half\nForty five and a half and uh you know just for our listeners at a vacation how is the line made\nQuite a lot of people ask that question it's a great question they think there's somebody in the back office with some type of computer system making the line it's just not the case I remember that these football\nI come out that Sunday prior so Sunday after the games are over the new lines come out and then there with low limits in Vegas that what we call\nThat into shape so like a market like any free market the gamblers making those lines not the odds makers the odds makers cut out of line it's a field and then the gamblers will bet that line into shape and that's why we see that line moves sometimes two to four points by the time starting that comes along when they're taking their\nBig action and all that line is supposed to do it's not supposed to accurately make the final score one out of every twenty times it does it does it does come out that way that everyone goes oh my God this book makers or is it but they don't talk about the other Nineteen games where they were way off\nAll of that line supposed to do is create a market where the\nCustomers the gamblers aren't sure which team to bet on it it guarantees two sided action and that protects the book makers so that's what a line it in that line is\nMade so when you look at the London you can pretty much be assured that there are people to watch this very carefully that are making that line and typically they have enough knowledge to be right or they wouldn't be in business\nInitially initially that lie is put out by the experts but the line becomes what it is by the gamblers betting\nAt all week and sharpening it up a lot of people are laying the three they're going to move to three and a half have a lot of people are laying the three and a half they're going to move to Florida and now that all the lines are connected via computer systems and all the places are hooked into each other\nThey know what's being that it every single station at every single sports book in town in Vegas and that's how they move the line and by the time Sunday comes around the experts may have had it at three and a half but it's moved to six and a half\nBecause that's what the better I think the line should be and what the better I think the line should be more important than what the line should really be because that's what's going to cause better step that both sides of the gay\nAll right if you like football if you like doing this stuff going to pick nation dot com technician de dum Steve booed and runs this and he's on our line right now you have lots of free things on there you can also pay for it and he explained the pricing before it's not outrageous or anything like that let's go to our second favorite team depending on where you live Atlanta and Pittsburgh\nRight so I mean it has gone over and all three of their last games last week when they play it all over the poster total Pittsburgh has gone over in three of their first four games so far to that than Eighteen now neither one of these teams know how to win we've seen that already but\nBoth can score and score in droves this one here isn't over for me to over fifty eight point\nPittsburgh's a three and a half point favorite have you put a gun to my head\nI Would bet Pittsburgh in this game but I just don't trust this team I mean I think a lot of gamblers look at the Pittsburgh name makes a big marquee name it's a brand and they're betting on the on the old Pittsburgh and not realizing that this is the new Pittsburgh and they're just not as good as it used to be\nThe solid that this game is over you\nKnow right and what's your thoughts of any on lumpy on bell returning to the Steelers this season\nI think he is running the risk of being blacklisted by every single team in the league at ... type of scenario you need to get his butt back in there\nBy any means necessary and prove that he's not a cancer because once you get labeled as that no owner is going to want to roll the dice on him they've already proven they're willing to look the other way even with tremendous talent\nNervous and how he could he could blow his career if he's not one\nHundred percent we've seen it happen it will happen again he should get it on his age and I'm telling them get in there make your apologies make me a cool click it and there'd be a good boy and a great because we need to put this thing behind us\nLet's go to southwest Ohio now Cincinnati and Miami\nSo and this is an interesting game because you know Miami started off the season great and uh and they ...\nAnd their first three games albeit again very slow teams tennis the ah the jets which are horrible you know and then Oakland when it come all the way across town to beat them\nThat last week we saw them get punched in the face by New England and it
