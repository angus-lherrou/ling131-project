thing\nYeah you've got it so I'm I'm listening to the uh the game on Saturday and um you repeatedly said we're just getting to the quarterback is is that a a deficit that we're gonna have a hard time making up this year for the ...\nI I think one of only rushing for people and they're you know the other teams are putting in a tight end or a full back were given change three or four seconds five seconds to uh\nFor the quarter back to make decisions and really beat us up past was I mean we went from being I think the number one pass the French and all of us yes last year to not be a very good right now yeah\nI think I think the past Russia's part of it but I think because you have so many young guys in a secondary um that that he's trying to put more people back and not take chances with books or something like that but uh so far\nThat's not working this year yeah and ... yesterday quoted you said that killed us all year I'm missing assignments blah blah fence defensively and often simply do you see that too\nI Do Dan and I and I think especially you know I I think we have some reason to be optimistic offensively I I I saw some good things I saw the fence building over the last four weeks still making steak still\nKeep times during the first half or we had a chance to be closer and the game and not be down by a couple of touchdowns they're still mistakes being made in the kicking game and often simply\nBut defensively with all of the new defensive backs that we have back there athletically they're great athletically there and right you know the right position but mentally I think because we have so many new guys back there\nTo me there's just too much thinking going on back there they're not allowing themselves to be athletes because they're saying okay if this goes in motion what am I there's too much thinking going on\nFor there to be so many open wide receiver I mean there there it was so crazy there were Fifteen of often some place where there was nobody within Fifteen yards are receiver and I just can't continue\nYeah I mean you're you're missing that far they're going to like the ... kids for ah the thing was seems to be solidifying the job day by day Disney\nYeah real deal I mean especially you know when when we got down by ... touchdowns place in the game I mean he uh you know we're looking for leaders Dan I mean in any team like that if we're going to turn this thing around you need leaders I think we really found on Saturday I mean van Gogh orders stepped up in a major way\nYou know broke the record for ... for completion Z and attempts at why issue\nAnd the head over four hundred yards and\nWas part of a game I think the game was close to four hours I mean it was crazy but\nHe uh he really stepped up and uh for somebody that was at Notre Dame for four years didn't play much since high school there was a huge question mark going into the season but not anymore we're we're not going to lose games because of Montgomery event border\nYeah you know some things on the casual fan your bank and you're saying the way he was putting that ball up in the third or the second half most of the second half\nOf why couldn't we do more of that it just seems like he was driving back and just throwing it and he was really lame those uh those defensive ends up I mean he he he really turned the game around the penguins because it was pretty ugly in the second half\nYeah he he really did and and if you take a look at it having a chance to talk to the coaching staff after the game even some of the mistakes that look like we're his and the first half\nWere actually you know a routes that we're not run right so ... you know with that I I think it it was better than advertised uh and uh that's not going to be one of the issues my issue offensively is that the end this started then at the beginning of the game that were running that\nKind of not an empty set but one back set with no titans\n'em and allowing Montgomery to make decisions on offensively whether the passer run and when we are running\nAlthough we have good schemes and things were being out numbered six seven in the box versus are five blockers and it's not the same Youngstown State running game and we saw it a little bit against south pole when we put those that tight and package and I I think we could be a good running team but uh\nYou you know there were too many times at western Illinois where it was second in twelve or Thirteen because we lost two or three yards on a running play that we have to turn around\nAnd yeah you got to southern Illinois coming up on Saturday um four o'clock kick homecoming um what's the challenge was southern Illinois\nWell southern Illinois a kind of has a season going like why issue a offensively not challenge that all their scoring\nMajor points but like why issue they've been giving up more than their uh their scoring so it it's it's going to be kind of plant a mirror image they're kind of a in the Missouri Valley conference where we're at kind of challenging themselves to to move themselves at least up to the middle of the pack\nSo it's a it's it's got to be a good challenge I thought western was going to be a good challenge but certainly neither team is we're in North Dakota state is or South Dakota states I felt going into western and southern Illinois that it was a good building game\nThat if we can win this game and get better and better by the time we got the south Dakota you know you could have a chance to have that confidence but uh\nYou know southern Illinois is a you know you know like us you know you're you're kind of have a cage the animal ah you know wanting to break out for the season not having much success so far\nRight well let's hope we can turn around and uh you would be remiss if we didn't talk about the ... kid from a Penn State I mean what what an exciting player he has to watch even though it was at\nA loss to Ohio State on Saturday Night\nYeah ... definitely want to see if not the top quarter back in the country and you know obviously Ohio State on the other side of that then might not be my favorite team in the world you have to tip their hat that they're kind of like the forty niners of Joe Montana era that they've been good for so long it they just\nFind a way to get it done I mean like when you were watching Joe Montana it's like you whether you were down by two touchdowns are two points that just seems at Ohio State has that kind of sick sense that we're we're ... we're going to find a way to do this and they continue to do it again a darn good team\nI mean yeah yeah that that that was a that was an exciting game and a is almost a shame if someone had to lose that because at the ... the Ohio State Ohio State change things in the second half of their credit do for a while yes they did\nThey ever good coaching staff and you know when you when you see things turn around and the second half its not by accident it's get those coaches getting together at half time and and figuring it out and coming out with just a little bit of a different game plan which are which they did\nYou know I'm watching the pro receivers yesterday and the raiders Brown's game in a\nAmazing catch is in a short and very very very small space that double quarterbacks are able to put that ball these guys are just amazing receivers are they not\nYeah it's crazy it's the same thing in the Steeler game it just it just amazes me some time that you would never ever if you're a quarterback for me based on what you saw you would never throw the ball you know they're looking at windows that are literally like\nTwo feet by two feet throwing the forty sound the field I mean it's crazy yeah just the athleticism that's a that's in pro football right now\nDo you keep in touch with the radio ranch I said oh\nI Know from our standpoint since Mark Davis took over he's a good friend of mine I'll never let him have much to do while we were out there but uh he has done a great job having alumni weekends and keeping in touch so\nVia the Internet and via and all kinds of things being sent to me yes the big greater weekend happens to

it's a it's going to be interesting but\nIt's hard to believe is when you see those a rapid rate or fans yesterday an all dressed up and they're going to take that franchise away from them it's just I Know I Know that economics probably dictated and they can't get a stadium that they need but I'm just to take it away from those raider fan yeah tell me how he\nFeels because of southwest being having a hub at the Oakland airport there that a lot of them will fly but when you see the stadium it's it's the thing I told them is you're not going to have a home field advantage in it I mean you saw the home field advantage yesterday yeah I mean it over time that you you know where the browns did not want what ends on they didn't want to go into\nYeah did you did you play on the the baseball when you were there in\nUh we played like it the er at at other fields that have I mean most of the fields back in the eighties were like that they were kind of common fields my rookie year we got drafted by the raiders state in Alameda but we flew to the LA Coliseum for our home game so I never got to play in that stadium\nIt almost seems like you're playing like they used to describe young sales day

welcome\nBut having them do a thorough investigation I actually think would be a blessing in disguise it will be a good thing\nMichael Bowers one of those from NBC Radio news Michael good morning\nWell good morning to you and happy October first\nSyria's October first and um we have a big week ahead of us here the FBI busy investigating so they have they gotten right into it already and started to immediately\nWe do know that they're at least it's been gone and we know for instance they have not interviewed judge Kavanaugh nor have they interviewed Dr Ford but they have indeed interviewed Deborah Ramirez uh she was the accuser number two that says the judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her or we also know that at least\nAt this point Julie sweating like the third woman to come forward has not been contacted by the FBI we know that because for a loyal Michael ...\nWho loves the camera and loves a good story is saying that he can't get the FBI to call him back on any level so we do know that at least the the\nThe stair starting points for this investigation have big and we also know that because in DC and this is an absolute shock or nobody Dan or they're pointing fingers at each other which ones right which one's wrong here you know they're saying that President Trump while saying that the FBI will have\nFree rein in this probe and then Saturday you've got to New York times article comes out saying that the White House asked the FBI to question only four witnesses\nThen that causes Dianne Feinstein to to write to the White House\nIn demand that they provide the Senate Judiciary committee a copy of the written directive that they've sent to the FBI\nWhich then causes the White House to go whoa hold on a second we haven't directed the FBI and anything that's all come from you guys in the Senate so that back and forth blaming game still underway here at the very start of this investigation\nWill Dianne Feinstein certainly has some questions to answer to doesn't she made about not bringing misinformation forward she kind of barrier to and that is a lawyer and one on one you know you cannot Gary evidence\nYeah and with that so we know that like for instance senator cotton is calling for an investigation not just on you know whether or not this was held back but then also did the leak of this information\nComing from Diane Feinstein office as well so that's also a big problem that needs to be looked at in and investigate it and thoroughly as much detail as possible and then there's questions in regards to uh whether or not there was confirmation from Diane Feinstein\nTo Dr ... lawyers on whether or not that can be a private meeting between the Senate Judiciary committee and Dr Ford or if it was only the option of making this public one happened so all of these kinds of things still\nIn limbo if you will while we're waiting for the ... the FBI investigation to go under but I don't know how much of that is going to come into play here it would seem to me is quietly and as they should the FBI will can contain their investigation to themselves and then come up with information come friday\nTo turn into the Senate Judiciary committee on some level\nOkay um does there have to be you would almost thinks oh a liar in this or multiple liars because when you saw judge Kavanaugh's testimony most people would say that as as a sincere as a you have ever seen\nHe apparently has produced calendars and then you have Dr Ford who people are saying was a good with us also this or have to be ... we have to point out somebody somebody's lying\nWell I think that's what the investigation was going to try to unfold here we know that Senator Flake said in the past twenty four hours or at least what we've seen on television in the past twenty four hours\nThat um when it's all said and done he believes that if for some reason Kavanaugh is found to lie then that will take his nomination off the table so in some level whether it has to do with the alcohol that he drank if there was ever a blackout element\nOr whatever any element that would consider to be a lie that was found out that that would take his nomination off the table similarly I imagine any sort of lie that was found to come forward from Dr Blass before it would also indicate a credibility question and us you would not be able to move forward with anything other than a vote\nNope you come back and just just focus on that and you're still going to get the people out there that are going to say I hate Donald Trump I hate what he is

Security system all of those and continuing you know the healthcare debate or opioid addiction I if you know the a prescription drug abuse or both financially and medically\nA so there are there ... there are a lot of domestic issues that seem to have gone by the way way side while we're caught in these controversies over whether a Supreme Court justice or did something as a high school student or not or whether North Korea is actually\nGoing away with a missile that way they the way we want them to you know I primarily ... a lot of time on those\nThings when it seems like some domestic issues are are just disappearing in front of\nOur I mean you'd probably see this too because you can look down your street and look and see how many people are involved in the news is you are you'll find very few very few that know what's going on they they can't relate to this Kavanaugh deal they can't relate to this constant bickering into all of this stuff\nGive us something that we can that will unite us in one of the things that unite us would be lower the taxes get written it let's have a better lifestyle for Americans here I think a lot of people even believe that our Defense Department is so bloated because it's a sacred cow people go back and say well you know\n... we've got to have tanks and then yeah somebody's why [laughter] know are we going to go fight the Iraqis again probably not\nBut you know just in case we do we're spending so much money and you know we just don't get to the things that really resonate with the American public otherwise people would vote bill\nOr ... you know and it's a I think back to a ... and President Trump of course an increased our military budget by a substantial amount and we now spend or [laughter] way more than anybody else in the world I think the figure is our military spending equals probably the next six countries combined on the list\nOr so or military spending is way way higher than anybody else or in the world and I think back to a joint Eisenhower who was a military general\nA guy involved in World War two and his policy which was a little controversial at the time because at that time we were in the ... beginning of the original Cold War with the Soviet Union\nA but it was controversial at the time when he said one bomber equals ten schools yeah a ... you know that type of relationship and\nAnd sooner or later it all comes around again but perhaps we do need more focus on this rather than a and political infighting that we're seeing a lot of focus on and or you're right a day and when you say that\nYou look at some of these issues going on now whether it be North Korea whether it be Syria whether it be the Supreme Court or whether it be infighting among Democrats and Republicans\nWhen at the end of it does this affect our everyday lives average person on the street here and the answer is now\nNow that they're going about their business and you must get bummed about your business you're up talking to a million radio stations today and do it by one okay [laughter] try to do that yeah thanks bill okay\nBuilds up for NBC Radio news ... news radio five Seventy W Caribbean and it is the damn rivers programs you know what I I don't mean to treat it so cavalierly folks\nAnd you know I'm just coming off of um the Akron children's hospital radios on and I just look at how people came together to raise nearly four hundred thousand dollars I think the total was three hundred and Ninety three thousand dollars and we raised 'em\nOver two million in ten years and people realize what a great job that we have been able to do for the kids here\nMany of whom who would not have lived if in fact we hadn't had hospitals like this\n[noise] and on the other hand ... and we're doing that\nMost people are doing that fifty cents a day they're racing this money providing for other kids and kids that they don't have because they're already grown\nBut we have this situation in Washington D. C. of capital but even one here locally which makes people grow weary of their government\nThe first thing you did yesterday morning after you got up you may have looked on the right hand section of the indicator and you saw David school next words where he says Christopher Sam or own a moaning county court judicial candidates refuses to acknowledge he was at a twenty four team meeting at which his\nFather the former mayor Charles them or own said anything as a league is legal if no one knows about it I've been around for a long time\nAnd I'll tell you what the easy part for most commentators and most people would observe the news is to say\nHere's the Democrats again years the Democrats again\nWell yeah\nBut I don't think most people believe that they just believe that this is the fault of a lot of people that are greedy and you folks don't relate to it I'll bet you\nAside from the very knowledgeable people that listen to the radio station there's just so many people out there and they've just completely turned this off completely they have no idea what is going on and how it affects them\nPeople realize well we've got a new hotel that's a good thing we got a new comedy club downtown we have a new tavern where they're calling it October fest\nBut the rest of this minutiae I Can't get to it because you know what I got to get kids to school somebody just hack my bank account\nI got a low tire on and on and on you hear people talking about the kinds of things that affects their lives and people look over here and they go well here we have people\nThat are in a meeting and people can't relate to it they basically say are you kidding me that's Youngstown that's the only way it's a lot of places not just young down but\nIt certainly is a problem for our valley\n[noise] [noise] but that's probably why people can't relate to it but I think that this letter you agree with those I mean obviously this is a very populous topic and I'm not going to get any pushback on this which I don't expect I might get a few eyes but some of the things that they're talking about\nIn this this group that is calling for a war on waste\nAnd they give the examples of

WPN dot com [noise]\nAll right let's let's said well stocked list review this a little bit here where we are right\nNow Republicans and Democrats\nOn TV yesterday there kinda sparring over the scope of the FBI's weeklong investigation of the sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSome democratic lawmakers claimed the White House has restricted the FBI from interviewing certain witnesses now\nIf you go to page aid to of today's indicator you're going to see where Michael ... he has this star witness and he's going to bring her for the says she is above reproach\nShe has all kinds of government clearances male she also has the false vacation of\nHer credentials when applying for a job she also has a number of court cases so above reproach well sounds to me like she she human she may not be a star witness either but they're looking through all of this stuff and the\nConclusion that I drew and we didn't have a chance to talk last week because of our radio on which made nearly four hundred thousand dollars\nFor I guess that was a small um price to pay to be off of our topics for a couple of days because we're able to bring in almost four hundred thousand dollars which will benefit the children of our valley so congratulations to Akron children's hospital and for all of you who gave\nMoney [noise] but you know what's really stinking about our government folks and you have to go back and look at this I don't know Cavanaugh I suspect that Kavanaugh partied a little bit too much in college\nAnd that he may be guilty of something I don't think it's a full blown sexual assault and I use that in quotes\nThe thing about it is Dianne Feinstein is more guilty Dianne Feinstein\nCommitted the cardinal sin from what I have heard from good lawyers burying a burying evidence\nRemember what happened when that happened in Cape Fear with Robert De Niro don't bury evidence\nThese people get a jail out of jail card someplace but\nShe decided that she wasn't going to bring this forward until the last minute and I thought Lindsey Graham really let them have it when Lindsey Graham came back and said you know I've been working with these people and I called them my friends\nAnd this is as low as it gets by doing a last minute effort in order to deny the country\nOf justice capital and that's what they've done that is what they have basically done\nThe son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said that his father would not have been surprised by the part is in turmoil surrounding this nominee\nQuote on a general levy level he wouldn't be terribly surprised about the incident the intensity surrounding the Supreme Court nomination because so much of it comes down to roe versus Wade at least that's how the left is presenting it\nRoe versus Wade that's that's what they think that we're going to be able to take care of this [noise] and then went on a personal level\nIf that's what it's about\nThen are you out there saying that the millions of babies that had been murdered since roe v Wade went into effect is something that you're fighting for\nYour fighting for the right to have more babies killed coming out of the well\nI don't know how ... how how she put it how do you put it\nJust look at how many abortions there were a prior to ... wait and look at the millions of children who never went on to have a life because they were killed and when you get down to the gruesome to solve it\nLong term long term babies\nKilled and that's what we're fighting for\n\nNo I'm not going to be so bold as to argue that it should be done away with completely\nThere are cases where the mother's life is in danger but when you come back to where we are right now nobody talks about it just looks at numbers look at the

Brookfield Tom's to talk about Brett Kavanaugh they're more income\nMore than ... you know uh what Dianne Feinstein and Democrats did which were then try to keep the sky from being a on a Supreme Court\nI mean do you think about it first of all I don't think this she is going to be as important as everybody thinks it is a John Roberts maybe will be a swing vote\nAlso you know you run they say well ... ... a ... inch burn will probably be the next one to retire early you know nobody knows I mean any one of those those people on the bench and and that includes the conservatives\nCould and even the youngest conservative or it could end up uh you know dying in your true I having an accident what have you but what really bothers me Dan\nIs when you consider the way they lift the image of of Kavanaugh's being this or tried to portray him as being the ... a a rapist and and gang rapist and everything else [noise]\nNot not just go back a year and a half ago what over that yeah when uh we had the election and the Republican congressional representatives ... practice in baseball and and some disgruntled Bernie Sanders or a voter\nTook a gun and and I started to shoot at go back to Nineteen Seventy five Dan a wind\nUp drove Ford pardoned Richard Nixon and\nYou had a Sarah Jane more ... of a net squeaky from both shoot at or at least I think the ... gun jammed on running for one of them but they both tried to assassinate drove Ford\nNow you don't think that that you know there there was some woman or maybe some uh a man who might have been in the brother or a husband or of a woman or what have you that was raped that that may be emotionally disturbed and may try to you know I mean they put a target on on on cameras back\nBecause people are going to go back here and say whether he whether or not he's guilty or whether or not he becomes the\nUh the guy he has been put through a hell of a lot and I'm going to go back and you know this is probably something people are going to go well you don't know about sexual assault you think about this woman that she says that she thought that she was going to be raped what about the people that actually were\nI mean you think about this woman and I I understand it's in the eye of the\n... of the person that has attacked but he is going to go back and be put into the same category as someone who was a violets rapist and that they're just got to be some moderation near somewhere\nThat not only that but but you know you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty and you're supposed to it's the burden of the accuser to provide the proof this whole situation was just the opposite of\nLet me ask you something here but when you think about this\nDo you have a hard time perceiving lies for example when Kavanaugh made his defense and he cited\nHis calendars his upbringing how he was typically not around Columbia uh Maryland and the ... the woman that did the accusing she seemed to be very credible to\nSay all actors are they all lying have they missed remember\nI had an hour I I have no doubt that both for coach well\nBut when you have somebody who can't remember what had happened where it happened or the people she says that will vouch for her says it said no it didn't happen I mean you know where do you go from there\nWell here's the other thing too how do you square that is that um after all of these investigations were they sloppy investigations as he went to become a judge on the circuit court I mean you know he went through all these ... says ... investigations\nDan I think the Democrats were looking for somebody to stop this so that will go into the next uh uh after the midterms and uh you know in a in the ... uh next uh find sequence or first session of Congress\nJust push it down the road ... and\nHere's the thing number one I I don't know if they can be done\nBut I really would like to see if it could remember there was a woman on ... on Trump's short list her name was or any bird I think it was and a ... like within the first five or six well I really think that you know if Kavanaugh doesn't pass at the end of this week\nTrump or to put her up\nMitch McConnell ought to go straight for for a vote forget about taking it through that and you know getting the approval of a committee\nTicket right for for for a vote and and Trump ought to do the same doggone thing Dan that Obama did with Obamacare and that is throw money Iraq you know ... ... you remember the Louisiana Purchase and the ... or a or a a corn Oscar kickback\nKeep listening to you I had radio one mind Gail

All right our first caller was from Hubbard if we're going to go to Hubbard admitted or Folger\nSeven to nine nine nine seven seven and asking you to respond to what Lindsey Graham just said and of course it's a few days old but I just thought it\nWas fiery enough that you needed to hear that kind of emotion that's coming from Lindsey Graham in this process or first call these Hubbard good morning and welcome to the show\nGood morning Dan ah I just want to make a few points uh first of all I did see what Lindsey Graham was talking about but I I Want to a kind of a shock the memory of people in terms of what a Mitch McConnell said when Obama\nFirst won the presidency because he he said that he was dedicated to making sure that Obama only serve one term furthermore\nThe appointment that Obama may for the Supreme Court Mitch McConnell did everything and anything he could to keep that from happening so what I'm pointing out is I think I'm more of an independent thinker and voter\nAnd I think uh the the hypocrisy is just really a shame I mean it's a shame that uh you know that's not\nBeing here are referring child you're referring to the judge ship that never got up to bat for the president\nYes and they purposely the Republicans purposely did everything they could think of to make that an impossibility so what I'm getting at is you know when I was growing up uh my uh parents and my my my elders in my family always talked about the golden rule which you\nTreat everybody a like you want to be treated so if you're declaring war on a particular situation you can expect\nThe ... the chicks back I mean it's I'm surprised that people are so upset about it but like I said most people aren't thinking about hypocrisy that's going on okay furthermore\nKnow I'm I Hope that our country reaches a point where we can get past all this and really treat each other not like the example\nOh that President Trump has said right from the beginning in terms of uh you know the big thing now is the economy's doing great but what about the character and uh the the morals and everything else\nAh my daughter is passed she's uh she's grown now but as a as a child I Would hate to think that I Want would want her to kind of her life after what we see that's going on in politics at the top of the thing ... uh and it's just it's just a doggone shame I mean\nWell I Know that I look at this and you know being a conservative it'd be very ... yeah I I can ... I can understand why ... why are Mitch McConnell was so fervent in President Obama's saying\nThat he can succeed because it was taken in this context that he can't change this economy\nAs much as he would like to do it with the health care he wanted to oppose that Mitch McConnell philosophically of course the words were chosen raw Rush Limbaugh's words were chosen wrong but I think it was more of a philosophy that the ... of the Obamas that they didn't want to change and furthermore\nPresident Obama did get to Supreme Court picks confirmed did he not\nYes he did but also beyond all of that when Obama took office where was our economy what shape was it in\nWas in pretty tough shape that we were\nGoing to when we were going down the tubes and so a bomb and gathered intelligence from different groups and came up with something that would help save us and that that and see what I'm what the thing that really upsets me is when people talk about the economy during Obama's period they don't even think about how what he was handed\nAnd and for him to be able to make that kind of decision gather the mines together and get us through that period\nUp until he was out of office he doesn't get any credit for that everybody just talking about how well Trump's doing an eye for the sake of the country I Hope that the things that Trump is doing will work for the benefit of the country but I get sick and tired of people making the comparison to the bomb and did nothing and all of a sudden Trump is doing everything that's not true\nYou know but they're you know here's what I Would say um you know that economy is something that I think that they get way too much credit when is good good or bad don't you I mean the thing about it is that economies are not really controlled by the president but let me let me just focused since you have called\nOn what we have been able to do in the middle east since Donald Trump basically we're not hearing of ISIS would you give Donald Trump the fact that he has handled that well\nYeah I can I I mean you know I [laughter] I won't read the book and it's it's completely empty there are some positive\nBut ah what what really bothers me is uh the the the tone of the way things are done I mean if you want to if you want to um create friendships\nYou don't do it the way it's being done you're going to have you're going to have enemies\nA flyer I don't know though the result of the tactics that are more years you're\nThinking man and I have to say that putting it in the face of Kim Jong moon and putting it in the face of ISIS seem in Iran now seems to have gotten their attention\nYeah but I think I think the north Korean leader is playing Trump that's been\nGoing on like that for many will will say the proof will end up cutting according to my friends I'm gonna I'm gonna go on let someone else comment but at least we go we have we have some common ground well thank you thank you appreciate it All right All right Bye bye\nMy pleasure by Seventy double duty being with the ... program well Mike I'm are people bringing golden coin shop\nSurvey happened you know we've been doing pretty good we've got a lot of customers of it coming in with their gold jewelry broken stuff old stuff you know the things you don't wear any more sit in that box collecting dust they're worth a lot of money these days\nI tell you what the precious metal when you bring it down um you know if it's a reasonable amount of money you give them cash and sometimes you had to give them check if it's a lot but the thing about it is that they can turn that stuff that you really just kind of sitting around and as you as always said he appreciated so much from when you bought it\nSure you know their stuff here is just you know we don't we don't want to because it's true we want it because it's cold\nWe're not really after the old ring or the Seventy year old necklace or whatever it is all we're concerned about is the metal but it has made us so if it's broken a rich damage you don't have to get it fixed you don't have to clean it it doesn't matter what it looks like because we're going to have melted down by refined or anywhere but you know then we always talk about this on the other hand\nI have got a great of a story of oil and gold and silver stuck right now I Know a lot of investors are coming in because we've seen silver take a little bit of a dip\nIn this isn't buying period for silver investors I Know I'm sitting on about a thousand silver equals in stock right now and the two thousand eight teams are actually getting harder to come by their Christmas present a lot of people by him so I Want to get the word out there and say if you want to get your Eighteen eagles I Would suggest to do it now

... right\nRight yeah I've got a great editorial right now of gold coins I've got a lot of silver coins if you're interested in gold and silver stopping to visit me you know\nThe markets are changing constantly they go up one day they go down Tuesday but you know these markets are still strong it's a good investing strategy it you know if you've got some old gold jewelry and you want to turn that in and turn it into actual silver gold bullion where you've got the physical solid gold products or solar silver products in your hand come see me we could do that for you to\nWell done All right see seeing him is it a seven by fourteen hundred for directions or if you want to just chat you can also find him on young still unfolding road right next to Miller rod in gun and a night for a long time and a serving the public well Michael I got to run but thank you very much for the update and I hope people will bring in their gold and silver and by some of your product\n... thanks date I bought a full day thank you very much\nAll right it is within ...\nSeventy WCBS we should take a break and then reconvene with Mike and Patty and many others\nBy media does\nHave to weigh the pros and cons of opening closing down\nYour young ladies you may have gotten older era where together and they had a\n... there was a tour for a while it was actually feeling this was always in the middle\nAnd what was this was like I shouldn't be that shouldn't be after either you and they would they would bite in what's going to go first thing they could go home from areas that I'm not to that point I like clothes and I'm not in any hurry whose money the sky McCrary festival and I got together with him that day and then he becomes liberty\nMushrooms in any other young [noise]\nAnd he came on to the bus and he said yeah I talked to a lot longer but I\nKeep listening to my heart radio one more Brad Paisley and all your favorite I asked the bally's\nPlace to talk news radio five Seventy W Katie and\nSimons eleven o clock for painted are natural hard was go to bed brothers dot com use radio five seven\nYou Katie and\nSherrie Westin with a new deal to replace NAFTA in hand President Trump\nIs that just speak this hour from the White House Rose Garden the address coming after negotiators finished off the deal just before a deadline at midnight he's ABC senior White house correspondents who say they got the administration\nHe's done that\nBut they would not dare give Donald Trump any credit for that because Donald Trump\nIs the enemy\nAnd I I I'm not out here ... saying that you don't you know what do you have good solid disagreements like Lindsey Graham he comes out and says and he's putting these senators in their place I get that good discourse don't be afraid of your own tongue\nBut just as we give Obama no credit for the current economy which I don't believe either because these things are cyclical and you talk to anybody that their life is money\nThey don't worry about who's the president or what policies are coming out there they're worried about the world economy and how it affects them they make money on both sides so I'm not going to say that Obama had nothing to do with the current economy just that Trump gets the credit no\nBut give Trump some credit if if you're on the other side Donald Trump is saving jobs\nDonald Trump has the steel mills humming somebody pointed out the old days it yeah yeah the union halls and they're all Democrats signs in their Donald Trump is why you have more orders but they can't do that because somehow they can't support\nA Democrat or Republican I'll tell you something I did see the other day that this crazy I saw\nI saw the peace of mind and the Democrats lawn\nSomething's going there maybe Tim Ryan will come on our program I don't know I'd love to have him in Mr the peace will come in here and have a civil discussion so we know where they're coming from\n[noise] but again Congressman Ryan he's not going to do that he's not going to put himself out there he doesn't have to because he gets elected by fifty or sixty or maybe even Seventy percent of the electorate here\nHe doesn't have to\nBut are we being denied what his thoughts really are Donald Trump is going to take about this morning for his agreement with Canada and Mexico one NAFTA don't\nYou think that some Democrat along the line here should say Donald Trump has done a good job in redoing these agreements somebody wears the middle ground All right let's go listen to the ... the calls here and that will push the brake\nPushed the break as long as I can let's go first of all to Mike in in ah Austin delta Mike this is Dan ... good morning and welcome\nHey how you doing Dan Hi Mike hey I Want to talk about at Calvin are just for a little fat or you know this lengthy Graham's right or you know I was in my early twenties when Clarence Thomas thing happen really didn't pay much attention to it because I was younger but this\nThis is the most sickening thing I've ever seen probably in my entire life I mean I'm a Democrat I mean but this these Democrats\nAre my father's Democrat Party this is ridiculous I mean it out [noise]\n[noise] this woman I don't know who she is I don't know what happened I was in there but I hear Dianne Feinstein they got this cat and all he's already can back I mean I Would like to ask Diane Feinstein you know what if he's in his I mean what if the ... maybe he didn't do is there a possibility\nThey don't care if they destroy yeah I mean I read an article usa USA Today published I guess it's judge coaches the girls' basketball team they said basically he shouldn't be allowed to coach girls basketball team and reference that he may be a pedophile you know I mean talk about destroying somebody's life\nThat you know and I don't get that back and he said one of the things that he enjoys most in life is coaching and he may not be able to do that and and the thing is you\nKnow this woman I I just don't understand how do you prove your rent is\nHere's another thing too is a is there a degree of sexual behavior or deviant see you know you could come back here and there is so much sexuality in our world right now is there a difference I mean is there a difference between\nUm\nI'm a I mean I take that like I'm not a good thing that he was give me the heads up the trouble is going to make an announcement but I think maybe our conversations a little more important but um\nYou know you go back here and you go okay is it something that he did at a fraternity Barbie there's despicable was he involved in this party work this woman was\nI mean is there degrees of sexual behavior to where you're completely ostracized you are considered a sexual pervert I think that that's what they've done with this man I'm\nPutting is but the thing is stand these these left wing wackos these you know the ones that are a quarter and ah you know the senator and the elevator\nThe bully you into their line of thinking I turn on CNN and I said reports or rape or up to ... percent where these numbers I mean like if you don't agree with that and then you have women I mean you know it it's not safe to be a man in America handy for\nWhat I hear a lot of women that are saying the same thing Kellyanne Conway saying the same thing that she was a victim of sexual assault and nobody wanted to hear her side of the story because she was the wrong politics\nSo if you go on a date now should you take her to a lawyer haven't notarized agreement sign you know what I mean witness by somebody\nBut I I said I said this the other day in relation to another case if you're going to go out and you're going to kill someone and maybe go to this make out so I think you need to pull off the record or in your cell phone and asked the woman if it's okay if we go forward\nI mean that your life can be rolling oh you mean as an act as it doesn't matter if it's true I mean I waited with people who are lawyers member outlaw Fort Smith ... from Fort Smith stay I mean we were kids they'd probably be sexual predators today\nYou know the answer I must I must move but I thank

see that I was watching football yeah but you\nKnow here's the thing that I Would say is this Dr Ford will for whatever she came on and she seemed to a hundred percent sure the Brett Kavanaugh violated or that's what everybody saw so you could go back and you can talk about their character who they work for a fact of it is she made a pretty good a witness didn't you\nUm [noise] they didn't give him a chance to defend themself um should have had a defense for war or they're ... they're trying to say that ah that ah that was hearing but it was actually a trial\nYou know I I don't know I mean he had a chance in the afternoon and I thought that he did as well as he possibly\nCould have eaten ought to have a defense attorney but he looked like a main\nRoad Atari and like she had she turned around and these two guys and she asked me she had her ... concert want to turn it kept basket advice\nOr a brick Kavanaugh given\nYou said that thank you very much I got to move on but I thank you for your call you're making the boy that he didn't have a defense attorney there but he did as good as he possibly could the thing about it is that I didn't get to watch everything but I don't believe that she proved her case\nNow whether she proof or case to the American public that's another thing that is what are you thinking this morning is I moved through the calls\nHow warm for an
