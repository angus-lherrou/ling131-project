the area there right now these service members are beginning to gather at staging areas in South Texas\nAnd Arizona and California and then it'll be a given final determination where they will be deployed along the border area but\nDan by law they cannot have direct\nInteraction with immigrants because the U.S military can't directly in force us domestic law including immigration law without congressional approval or ... that has not happened of course so they can not have any direct interaction with the immigrants\nGot it so the policy come and taught us prefer that prohibits them from doing such how about uh the president can he deployed these troops without asking Congress or did he get some kind of her approval\nWell he can deploy them in a support role without asking Congress ah

I I think if John F. Kennedy were alive today it'd be a Republican because the Democratic\nParty has left the values that are made my mom a Democrat back that day and and now today she votes Republican you know should done that for last and Fifteen Years but because the Democrat Party has left her you\nKnow you gotta I'm sure you have your eye on a lot of races here in Ohio but the one particular interest to us we're going abroad yes a debate on Thursday night between Congressman Ryan and a newcomer Krista ... Chris has a a a well qualified candidates have had him on the program a number of times he knows the issues\nUm what do you know about that race and how do you feel about it right now is your a couple of a week out\n... those those districts so like that in the eleventh district in in Cleveland art art ... for Republicans because of the because the imbalance there in in the voter registration but but but but here's the thing that's important Chris Christie is a great candidate\nAnd uh you want to have good candidate because\nIn certain elections when when when your party does extremely well\nYou want to be able to take advantage of it if you remember back in Nineteen Ninety or during that wave election we had solid candidate\nFor the United States Senate in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and we were able to windows we not only won a Senate seat but we took back the house of representatives for the first time in decades it's so ... ... there are fighting hard\nHe he's an underdog no doubt about it but but having a good salad candidate there is key to I'm taking taking advantage of opportunities if they present them\nSorry we're talking to young Senator Bob ... you know you're always a young senator he's the co chair of the RMC and Bob most of the money that is being provided by the ... are you putting most of your money in the gubernatorial race here in Ohio\nWell what what we're doing is it all ground game and so what the orange she does is we have this tremendous data operation that we've and invested over a hundred million dollars and over the last ten Fifteen Years\nIn in that data available to any Republican candidate a that that wants to use it includes a phone app to knock doors to make phone calls and whatnot but the big invest but we have is our ground game uh our folks it made over four million\nVoter contacts either by door knocking and phone calls and so some of your listeners I'm sure have been\nA had had someone on our front porch on a Saturday afternoon a talking about a Republican ticket and and that benefits everybody Jimmer and ac running for the U.S Senate Mike DeWine a who's running for governor I was actually with Mike on the bus tour I think when he called in to your show last week so\nAh we ... we we've we're crushing it in terms of ground game and the Democrats have nothing they the DNC has put no money into Ohio or the state party has no organization\nThey they're they're not focused on turning out the vote in the in the mid term elections especially when they're close that that's the real key to victory is the ground game uh we\nWe ... we have the best mid term ground game that this party has ever seen in the state of Ohio and it's it's facing up against a a a non existent ground game from the Democrats\nIs that something that shows up in polling though because um there are no it it it does not know it it it\nIt's all a function of look up a poll it you know poke holes have all kinds of different strengths and weaknesses to them but what it gives you is kind of a snapshot that\nThe differences whether those people actually turn out and vote whether or not they show up on it\nYou know do you do you think that people do do you think people will um [noise] ... you know be wise enough to see that this issue one what it really is a change in the constitution of the of the state of Ohio\nBut they are going to know who will allow people to get out of jail that you probably shouldn't and they're going to grow really drug dealer in my opinion from the judges I've talked to they said it would\nAlmost render the courts the drug courts just useless and do you think the Ohioans will see that because we have with other constitutional amendments I Know when we tried to do the drug issue here in tie it to the Veterans Administration\nAnd the there's been there were some casino issues that went down that probably shouldn't have passed do you think that Ohioans will reject this also\nI Do I get in an op ed or a week that ah that called it the drug dealer amnesty act and it is because it lets people out early and it creates a magnet for drug dealers particularly for border\nAreas like a you know Youngstown southern Ohio and in in western Ohio ... in in the in the problem is as you said it changes the constitution\nSo if these folks that are sponsoring it a get it wrong it's nearly impossible to change look we we need to have some sentencing reform I Know the president's looking at that I Know leaders in Ohio Legislature are looking at that ... there's a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this issue one is the wrong way\nWho do you think in a can you identify people who have brought this to Ohio do you know who they are\nYeah well ah this was all funded by a George Soros and mark sucker bird uh they they each put millions of dollars be high getting this issue on the ballot and they're also underwriting or the TV advertisement campaign\nDone it so it really is true I mean that's where the paper trail leads to this Soros in soccer bird\nIt it's out of state we see this also with a lot of the Democratic candidates\nOn the statewide ballot or eighty five to a Seventy percent of their funding dependent upon which person you're talking about\nIt is getting their contributions from out of state and so you have to wonder what the motivation is more somebody that lives in California to want to vote for a while to fund a Democrat and campaign for secretary of state and Ohio\nYou know something that the molesters call about a lot and they say you know what when you go out there and make a claim about a candidate whether it's Jim ... who is on a a jet plane all the time and you don't really or if it's Michael ...\nHe's a ... putting a campaign literature out there who says and then that becomes a focal part of the campaign um\nIs there any rules and regulations about what you can say in a radio or television ad\nWell it it it's really a free speech issue or the way it's governed in Ohio is you have an Ohio elections commission that that will look at some of these issues and if something is particularly egregious a person can file a complaint with the Ohio elections\nCommission and it'll get educated out a doesn't happen often because you know that I mean political speech has a lot a lot of wiggle room and it I mean if you're trying to get an idea across in a thirty seconds you know spot or Fifteen second spot and you're trying to\nTrying to get that so so so a lot of times people will go with stronger language at it at times but I'm a but look at the American voters is is pretty smart I mean look at that that twenty sixteen race\nOr Hillary Clinton spent ten million dollars in the month of August against the Trump campaign that that spend the nickel on TV and the month of August and\nYou know she got she got smoked in Ohio eight and a half percent a victory for President Trump a so it isn't always about advertising it because I think the average voter particularly the average Ohio voter is much smarter than uh some of these folks give them credit for\n... I mean some of the candidates they tried to put their best foot forward and talk about their record but all too often it's about tearing down another candidate on both sides and uh I don't know I they they must feel that some of it sticks\nBut it it definitely works or if it if it didn't work a windows ...\nRight yeah very good right or the or the campaign here for governor of the state of Ohio I understand it's very close is that your conclusion also\nYeah the leads open St governor races tend to be close contests a\n... it it's no surprise there but I think what gives us the edges you know my wine is running on a a positive agenda for Ohio things that he wants to do for the state uh Ohioans are familiar with him because this record\nSo you have a business of employing people right here so if you're thinking about alarm we'll put you will search for Howland alarm ink Howland alarm ink and for those of you who don't have a computer three six nine twenty nine fifty six three six nine twenty nine fifty six\nWell Jesse I look forward to telling your story here and uh something is very important in this protecting the security of your family\nAbsolutely take you Dan\nNice to meet your day sorry about that is Jessie from Holland alarmed brand new client with us and we'll be telling their story over the next uh oh I don't know you're so three six nine twenty nine fifty six three six nine twenty nine fifty six I Will do open lines coming up in about five\nMinutes let's take a break so and as we promised the news in check and see how the sun still shutting [noise]\nAre you looking for a new career in the steel industry Hi this is Chris on without\nBrad the opportunity to learn and dance and provide for your family with a career about rock star [noise] go to Valerie Johnson online dot com to apply to become a part of a team that is almost twenty thousand strong tackling the world's most towns applications in oil and gas go to Valerie jobs online dot com\n[noise] this\nIs the Dan River show on news radio five Seventy W.

us here and thanks for joining us on and we only asked for four hours a day [laughter] that is a big portion of your day though for those of you to stay with us all the time uh we really appreciate that and that we try to give you a good honest product everyday that so\nThat gives you access to the airwaves or you know where else can you get that where else can you then probably the Internet but ah right here it's instantaneous man and you're on the air and you're talking to people out there and you're influencing people and we're having a big discussion on um how things should be\nBut I just wanted to ask you this is this fair\nWhen ... ... and are you tired of this are you tired of hearing the left complain about the things that Donald Trump says on tweets\nAnd people that wish they wouldn't ... and wish that he wouldn't be out front and talking about the press [noise] but ...\nIf you think about it if you think about it and and I think Fox does as good a fair job as they possibly can you're gonna laugh at that but here here's a here's my thought on this I don't\nThink that you have the rhetoric turned up to the point that you get on MSNBC CNN in some of these other places is it fair to say the late night comedians\nMost of their shows are dedicated to blasting Donald Trump whether it's funny or not now ... years where I kind of draw the um the parallel\nWhen Jay Leno was in town two weeks ago and I was at the a standby auditorium Jay came out and he used a couple of things\nDonald Trump and use a couple of things about Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and then he moved on to things that may happen in our everyday lives\nHe didn't focus on this do you get to the point where are you saying you know there's this new stuff coming on Donald Trump everyday or Nancy Pelosi or whomever is just not all that entertaining and this has become our entertainment\nIt's not like Jerry Seinfeld doing a show about nothing and they could have you're laughing about nothing\nBut ... is is this fair I mean you got the left are complaining about Donald Trump is Donald Trump and maybe my show the only people that really defend the right\nWell maybe Sean Hannity does a little bit maybe Rush Limbaugh doesn't run for but you know what I mean we certainly don't reach everybody\nLook about look at the cartoon but the Youngstown syndicator add in yesterday just go ahead and look at it and\nYou'll see the shots that are taking at Donald Trump and basically blaming him\nFor the tragedy that just occurred in Pittsburgh but\nI'll stick with late night comedy I didn't I didn't even preview these but I'll just take a chance I'll just take a chance here let me um let me just look here and um and look at late night last night now this is the day after the tragedy and I know that the Jimmy Fallon than than some of them treated at very nice\nBut\nIf you if you actually look at late night on a regular basis you're going to find out that they simply go back well here's a here's here you can count on you can count on Stephen Colbert right here here excuse me [laughter] Cheryl that exam which was good [noise] um\n... times like these are nation looks was president for comfort them guidance that's our first mistake\nThere you go you're talking about the precedent you're talking about the ... and I don't need to give it all to your right Stephen Colbert our first mistake looking at comfort in guidance from the president\nYou can't even give the people that are suffering in Pittsburgh that time [noise] so I go back and I am just asking you and you know what I certainly want to talk to people all the left\nYes absolutely those coins they're always the stuff that you see on late night TV on sale or you hear about the guy who found a coin and didn't even know he had it and what it was worth and you know that's what we're looking for looking for the customers that got some stuff to want to find out what it's worth bringing it let me take a look at it even if you choose to keep it high still will give you a phrase the free appraisal and I'm going to treat you guys\nSeven five five fourteen hundred for directions young stone polling road right next to build a rod and good thank you might\nHave a great day thank you All right\nBye Seventy WKBD in seven five five fourteen hundred for directions to the coin shop but it's easy to find most of you know where it's at [noise]\nFrom Sean team twenty seven partly cloudy fifty seven took me a little breezy today [noise] and then light rain tomorrow with a high up sixty two Thursday forty eight friday fifty six but again [noise] enjoy this day it's forty two right now we're supposed to push towards fifty seven degrees [noise]\nSo in any case our temperature is forty two and a\nThe thing that I was talking about here today you know people talk about Donald Trump's tweeting and all of that stuff and I know sometimes it makes us cringe but then you tend to look at what he's up against you know\nBumped teen networks come and get him on a regular basis plus you have the Democrats out there in the late night TV [noise] Here's Michael Michael do I have a point on all those what are you thinking\nI think that the crowd St Joseph Stalin would have loved to look at the dedication from this rap stream media or not they're not even you know what they are they're paid prostitutes for the Democratic party I've never seen anything like it in my life\nEvery time and I find a channel or how much they hate Trump and you know you can tell that happen because if you look there's a lot of Republican strategists down last against Trump they went over to MSNBC and CNN and I\nBet you a dollar on it they're getting paid to do that\nAnd I I like it I I think about this too I mean are these folks true believers are that they basically are kind of putting all their ships against the booming economy against\nTheir their pay prostitutes damn that's all they're doing\nAnd uh I\nBelieve that the media is\nThe biggest cause of all the victory all division within this country you know it's like this this guy that went up that shot up all those people and it's very easy to Trump so but the prices like see what Trump's worked sweets that\nThis is Trump you know what I mean it it it's ... they've gone over the edge and then if they don't get what they want this November I Can't wait to see that\nYeah oh I Can't wait for a very good ... kind of what I'm thinking appreciated Michael a let's go to Mike and now to Michael he is on the same topic in war and Michael\nWelcome to the show yeah thank you Dan ... with that last fellow us Michael ... was was was that on you know I I got to the point where I don't know why are we even even gives the media in this country and then some of these these so called late night talk show comedians\nThe time of day because it's got to be on you know\n... including the Democratic party\nIt it's not I I really this is what I Believe I Believe that it's it's it's not Donald Trump that they hate so much\nThey hate what he represents because when they talk about him and the things they say about him they say about people like me people in the mid west people that are you know they live on on the everywhere in the country because what\nSome of the things that they said about this man they've also including his his followers dose of follow him mhm you know like like we're talking sixty Seventy million people they actually degrade us they actually demean us and they they think that you know somehow because we don't agree with their ideology\nThat you know war stupid we're we're we're we're not even we're not worthy of being\nYou know human beings citizens of this country\nAnd so they feel that they have the right to go out there and they can say whatever they want about this man and in spite of the opposition look what he's done and he's he's a results\nOriented guy yeah and he's getting results in this country that and they can't stand that\nWell it doesn't it did it in the future if you go on your shoulders everything that they claim that doesn't work is working\nKnow you've got new to new groups heading toward mckell in Texas everybody hundred miles away now and a Donald Trump is responding by saying\nHey turn around you're not getting in a it takes a little bit of guts to put that out there for Americans and that you do on a personal level you say I'm very sorry for these people but you know what you cannot come into this country and Donald Trump is responding now who would you rather have is the president\nHillary Clinton rock Obama\nDonald Trump you know where Trump is going to stand on this\nExactly at it and the thing is the end and he's doing exactly what the president of any president United States should do his first job as president is to protect this country it's sovereignty and its borders\nAnd she and I think he's doing one heck of a job doing that because he's doing what we hired him to do it in a oh and and just real quick going back to what happened over the windows that terrible massacre and then that that that Jewish synagogue\nThe fact that the media and and people ... congressmen or senators and and and all these Hollywood types what would come out and say that this man is anti Semitic either most\nAdvocate for the for the nation of Israel that Jews are probably ever ever better I mean its own daughter extroverted to Judaism you know of course you know his his brother in law is a practicing you know\nWell and and the rest of the world in in Israel the you know they may name street suffered Donald Trump [laughter] you know they understand that he said that he was going to move the capital of Israel to Jerusalem he did a he's respected more around the world I Believe that he is here in the United states\nBut you know and then that even though that's a really good point you make because they come out and they tried to tell the American people that he's anti Semitic when I see that I get angry but then at the same I my wife by how either stupid or do they believe that we the American people are that we would\nBuy a line like that you know what do we know that it's completely the opposite you know then you\nWait till next week next Tuesday that's the way that they're they're really hedging our now ... I called the way I put it now it's going to be a blue ... it's a wall and it's just like election day in two thousand six team there's going to be a lot of Guam and shocked faces on weapon is\nThe easiest ones and an honor of ... uh Pittsburgh I went to two in Pittsburgh and those were some of the most difficult I was really surprised that the west Virginia one the bat wants them to be and it was downtown\nWest Virginia I mean not that they're not busy downtown but you know you have to use private parking there was no problem parking on the side so I got to have to pay for parking and I'm thinking boy what's going to be a real mess getting out of this but I wasn't\nI guess 'cause the the way the traffic flow it out of the the downtown just went fast but I did have problems getting out of Pittsburgh down on that last one just before the election\nWas on when you when you when you have your your print your tickets on line and we're going in and you're you're young you're standing around a part of their bathrooms typically available and are there is or refresh miniature what's what's it like inside those joints\nWhile usually when you get you know I've seen restrooms aren't crimes that Pittsburgh one you were I was in line for probably at least two hours on that one yeah but when you got when when you got close to the building there was restrooms they're lined up so they did that good\nBut I didn't need one I mean the trial the even though the line was four blocks long and West Virginia it moves so fast\nThat uh you know by the time he got in and you know you used the restrooms inside the thing they have that if there are they they have something like the ... valley sooner their forget what it's called now on mortgage I don't see any problems at the ... center Columbus at the airport that was another little bit of a ... a problem with parking\nAnd stuff because there was you know it wasn't like a bad do you know they parked you seem like\nI was parked in a lot it was Pittsburgh that I was parked there you know crazy they parked in in a lot but they were like office lots or something\nMust have been to what five or six of these things over your lifetime with Trump\nI think I've been to seven and I think if I go to claim that will be eight\nSo what I I go\nBecause it makes me feel really really good about my fellow Americans in my country\nIs that right I mean so in other words you go and you have a better feeling about what you're standing for right now and you've been a long time Donald Trump supporter you go out and you go to the RMC rallies and uh you you do science and all of that stuff but you're saying internally it validates what I'm doing\nYou have a new home is in your future Sam pezzullo homes or remodeling should be your first stop\nFirst of all they use three D. drafting and rendering so you're going to easily see what your home and looked like inside and out in fact\nYou can walk into the rooms virtually\nYou'll know the house before it's built that's all before they pound the personnel and is one of Youngstown most acclaimed respected construction companies you could always trust that Sam pursue low will deliver excellence they do custom homes they do remodeling design build and aging in place now given the particulars in a moment\nBut keep in mind ... homes and remodeling has assembled a very talented team of professionals and they're all committed\nTo satisfying you the client you'll start with a sales appointment and end with you're moving day now the particulars you'll find Sam pursue low homes or remodeling in Canfield for twenty seven south broadstreet the phone numbers five three three Twenty one thirty seven and check out their find website Sam pezzullo homes dot com [noise]\n\nOn radio five Seventy W.

veterans great place to go see the\nNext country we've got ten thirty four here on by Seventy WKBD in my phone's you're open to you and a lots of little things are on our mind here today um and we've got a call in maybe to find out about what the bishop had to say this morning so we'll try to bring that to you also\nAnd I teach this a little bit but um people are having babies but not the developed world about that Japan now has one in three people over sixty five that's that that he was old one in three people and\nSouth Koreans have actually stopped having babies craziest and why is that well it's not a scene out of um the film children of men or the global population loses the ability to procreate\nIt's not The Handmaid's tale where uh you know unlucky women are in slave for fertility it's just a country ... interested in having babies\n\nThey commissioned a study they say the country's birth rate is tipped as low as zero point nine six this year that's the index the right to keep their population stable just to point one they're below one\nIn the decades after the Korean War the south\nThey um they they went from a devastated nation to the eleventh largest economy but what's the future of a place like South Korea where they don't have babies\nThe latest annual census there say the working age population defined as between Fifteen to sixty four it fell by a hundred and sixteen thousand in the year twenty Seventeen alone\nYou know we think it's hard to find work here if we go down the same rate this road now I Know you're probably\nThinking oh well hell that's Twenty years from now I'm not I'm not worried about that today dance but isn't it interesting\nYou know who's having babies yeah yeah\nPeople in Central America they're having babies were not\n\nThe people in the middle east they are having babies and we are not I don't know how you turn this thing around here either I mean you know we often said something as basic as this are we going to have to form this out to\n\nDespite the uh the tax cuts rising middle class incomes the birth rate is as low as it's ever been in American history I'm just going to throw this out folks\nWhat would infuse a baby boom in this country\nOh not have a caviar to you'd have to have a couple of learning yet have you have to have people that are going to raise the kid to but is there anything in the her on the horizon\nLike World War two when people came back in droves and made this economy going\nThis is the most dismal numbers as far as children in the Americas since time has started since we've been keeping track of this oh I Know some of some of you people you know to shrug you just say well gee yeah birth rates higher than Germany's that's not saying much will\nAngle of Merkel\nShe opened Germany's borders to the caravans in twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen so we're trying to keep these ... the caravans out should we be saying that the future folks\nUp poor nation\nNow Merkel she did this to show compassion and or maybe to resolve the problem that she had with the Germans lack of babies\nShe thought she would be um she would have I already made cadre of workers\n\nSo what she got as a bunch of people that can't speak German they're not that well educated\n\nAnd there's a very small minority of them that are gainfully employed factories are now moving back to the United states and we're having\nTrouble finding people to fill the rules\nCan you imagine if this continues the way it is right now what would inspire a baby boom here in America or the only thing I can think of as Donald Trump because he's giving us such a such a positive thought about our America\nWould it be better for the next generation of workers to be made here in America than imported from abroad\nI Would think\nGo forth and procreate my friends that's what we need right now we need native born people\n\nWe need language skills mom and dad need to teach him\n\nYou look at this a mob of people coming here they don't speak our language most of them probably haven't been ... haven't been educated that while\nYeah another it sounds like a the bishop is just trying to be out in front of the story after what happened in western Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania in general um you know just wants to really be proactive and getting these names out it's not like this is a a a revelation or anything that there are new charges\nOh no these are not new in fact he said at one point the most recent credible accusation and ironically the one that has meant the\nMost recent a financial settlement with the dioceses was brother Baker who was widely reported he had been at JFK and Warren at one point he had been in Pennsylvania um he I Believe has since passed away if my memory serves\nYeah I think you might have taken his own life I'm not sure uh yeah I I\nBelieve that that was the case and and the bishops said that there were forty seven accusations against him and eventually as you said I I Believe he took his own life you\nKnow very good All right Well Jerry well listen thank you for giving us a ring and letting us know what happened and I'm sure we'll see these names and he says that de Paul games will be getting this list is that uh and he wants to be a couple complete wiring but I think they're\nGoing to turn these over just\nNot that any even he doesn't believe that there won't be any sort of legal action take but there may be at some point if anyone is still within and they're still encouraging anyone who sees our reporting tonight or or sees it on line or ears it on your air\nThat if someone comes if someone has a recollection or someone believes that that's something they've happened they want that person to come forward not only are the dioceses what's a local law enforcement\nAnd report what they believe happened\nWell I mean in my estimation as a practicing Catholic too as a very distasteful story that are most of the population of the Catholic Church has\nKind of a wish it would go away and can't believe that it occurred and it's just a hurtful thing for people who drink their religion and they love their Catholic Church uh it's been something that people have um tried to get past hopefully we're getting past it\nWell and then as we all know the first step is acknowledged you went the other thing actually happens\nYeah Jerry thank you very much for calling after alright\nChannel twenty sevens jury Richard II reporting on what the bishop released this morning at a press conference at ten o'clock this morning okay it's damn ever supposed to open lines is go back to the point here is on yup okay we're on seven to nine nine nine seven seven the latest announcement on a national level\nDonald Trump has said that he will now by executive order get rid of birthright citizenship\n[noise] you know other countries that France has already done that Ireland has done that New Zealand is done that India has done that these countries have already said this is partly because what happens is that people go on baby vacations\nSomehow they do it they fly into the United states they have a baby the baby is now a citizen of the United states the mother comes along with the baby it's also be doing the being done in Hawaii by Asian couples and birthright citizens are going away that's\nWith Donald Trump is saying that he is doing and did you do you have something\nBuilt a lot of I was just going to say um he wants to do is through executive order but I think it would take an actual amending the constitution so we'd have to have an image of the states and all that stuff I don't think he can do that with an executive order I mean 'cause it seems to me people were afraid Obama was going to do that to the second amendment\nAre they going back I mean if you go back and this is in the constitution you know that you when you were born here in the United states you are an American citizen right to go back and repeal that um yeah you'd ... you'd have to go through a constitutional what they do whatever they ... yeah you know if you'd you'd have to do a thing to amend the constitution\nOr about that and that should give us pause when we go back and we think that we're getting ready to vote for issue one here in Ohio and we'd have to have a constitutional amendment to change issue one if it goes through\nBoy I'll tell you what that is a heck of a step that's why we haven't legislation that's why we have legislate tours that\nBring this people and the answer to us crazy isn't it [noise] alright seven to nine nine nine seven seven but here's something that I said yesterday\nI have not gotten a good reason why this could not be done save for the fact that Congress is not in session until after the midterm elections\nBut after the midterm elections will still have time to care of and will be here wouldn't Mitch McConnell and Congressman Ryan be able to speak or the house be able to bring up\nThis idea that if in fact you were coming here to the United states then you step one foot in the United states that you're automatically are given\nYou're given the status of being a political refugee we know that were being used federation for American immigration reform so if in fact you brought that up wouldn't you love to see\nThe Congress Democrats and Republicans go ahead and show your colors here because you have all of these refugees that are coming into the United states and they're going to basically come in and say now um we are fleeing and that we're going to turn your loose in the public now in all fairness Donald Trump is the best not going to happen\nThat they are going to have large camps and they're going to plan for this in the eventuality that this happens that they're going to have in a camp and they're not going to release them as general into the general population but they will give you they will be in a refugee camp yesterday\nI was going to add and we just got a very insightful text from a friend of mine that says the fourteenth amendment has never been tested in the Supreme Court so they may be able to do something through a friendly Supreme Court to further defined the meanings there of or something like\nAll right and they're grinds on a Trump that's his latest thing this morning he says birthright citizenship is out the window he'll do it by executive order\n[noise] then I heard that George Soros is paying to educate and trained the care of in a while there are marching through Mexico\nEven some of the children are going to have college degrees [laughter] they're coming to hand can you hear the footsteps yeah the they are coming they are coming in so it was Christmas middle and got to have an somebody's being a little cheeky uh-huh no more and it is the rivers program here at seven to nine nine nine seven how about this\nI've been on a couple of cruises ended I never have yeah I've been on a couple of crews there that really a great vacation because\nWhen you go on a cruise basically everything's done for you know in you know what you're going to be doing Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then Saturday your Saturday you're going to get back to the pork and get a fly home it's on my bucket list yeah it's cool thing to do but uh [noise]\nIs there nothing sacred any more you can go to Florida a couple who took a five day carnival cruise and they had a camera hidden there stayed room and\nThey're saying the cruise line hasn't contacted them or apologize but a camera in the state room unbelievable what we're doing the guy says I asked my wife what's this and she says is that what I think it is we're both just one white has goes to the ship's officers inspected and dismantle
