{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "So here's a really important point I've been thinking about this a lot\nEverybody what these terrorists said we'd be getting inflation well actually we have that inflation side around well two percent or it hasn't even gone over three percent yet that's my that's where we should be that's the science of how the economy I think the two biggest threat to the economy from where we are today\nNumber one is that the ... ... it's too aggressive they tighten too quickly to strongly um they send interest rates on his consumer spending in that plunges into recession so that's my first worries but the Federal Reserve\nPsycho worries with oil so inflation's low oil prices have been threatening up and they told us through throughout the entire economy so you know say something goes bad with Saudi Arabia or with your rainy and sort of or that\nIn oil prices go up that is going to hit the economy is going to hit the manufacturing sector ... it'll\nConsumer spending that those are the new baby why am I my information terrorists or none of that has been hurting the economy that's all been helping in my opinion you know what people complain about CNBC again I don't think that's the big ... big threat is interest rates go up too fast in oil goes up too fast\nIn fact he in fact a lot of the concern that people express early on as far as terrorists and that kind of stuff and how prices which like\nNone of that really has happened just overwhelmingly I mean you heard about how much more would add to a car and how much more it would cost you to buy your your pop and aluminum cans and that kind of stuff a lot of that was nothing more than scare tactics correct\nExactly right when he was running a chance to financial traps\nAre what are these reporters are you know they're straight out of college don't those poor whatever they hear from corporate leaders okay so if a guy science skill sets all these terrorists are going to\nPut me out of business do report that as the gospel it does he have any basis in reality book interest rates are excuse me inflation rate I've been around ... percent they\nHaven't gone up prices have actually been trendy down recently they haven't been going up I'm a woman up prices seem so all these ... all the air moderate up\nPrices which sky rocket people lose their jobs it has to happen you don't forget he put tariffs on solar panel manufacturing everybody says that would destroy solar panel jobs here in the United states the opposite is true solar panel manufacturing jobs have\nGone up a so open to get a water this scare mongering that we heard last year it\nHasn't been bored out with Tara I'm ... and just ask yourself a simple question okay if parents are so bad why did the Chinese the Japanese decrease the Germans the Taiwanese every major industrialized economy the Canadians Mexicans out the Brazilians why are they all have the Arabs\nAnd so this whole idea of the terrorists are going to destroy the U.S economy it has it half the where's the beef quote that famous commercial\nAnd what are your thoughts as you're talking about energy prices going up because the city to taking a different approach with than Warren in an energy in general I mean he's opened a lot of stuff up the making of the United states is a huge energy producer right now and that's helping what cheap energy prices down comment on that\nYeah so this is a problem with oil though you're absolutely right the big policy it's a global market\nSo the U.S has been firing on all cylinders oil production is at record highs and we're the biggest energy producer in the world now I'm we're making more oil and natural gas than ever before but the problem is is a global market so well us supply it's been up\nSaudi Arabia supply has been curtailed OPEC somebody has been curtailed at our friends in Venezuela the socialist that's way under Hugo Chavez they can't keep the pups running anymore you know as well as one of the most oil rich countries in the world\nBut because they can't govern their country it properly their supply has dropped precipitously so what that means that we have a tighter global oil market and that's why oil prices have been trending up or if it weren't for the United states' oil prices will be at a hundred and fifty two hundred bucks a barrel\nThank God for the state's GDP loyal price set a reasonable level but what that means is you know were firing on all cylinders if we start to have\nProduction slow the market is so tight right now you can see all the prices go higher so that's the situation with energy gas prices should be pretty low in terms of natural gas or heating gas because that's basically a close mark is just the United states we don't have any problems there with the oil markets with gasoline\nWhen you take a look at taxes for just a second talking with Danny Davis economic ... since the uh the top fifty percent pay Ninety seven percent of the taxes the bottom fifty percent pay three percent\nA year and then of course you can get into the top one percent I mean it is it is really a divided country as far as who's paying a do you have any thoughts on that\nYeah you know I don't think it's necessarily wrong that the rich pay more okay I think that's fine and they have to support the EPA structure they've done well they should pay more I accept that principle but the big problem is it's everybody doesn't have a stake in the system\nYou start to have freeloaders white so you know it's one thing if if everybody paid said everybody's invested in the country they all wanted to do well they're going to work hard to keep it running the problem is you have vast\nSwaths of the population that you don't pay any taxes the problem with that if you don't pay any taxes you don't feel that it whether it's in your community whether it's in your real estate or whether it's in your schools whether to your country because you're just not painting did so that I think\nThat's a big problem I I think that we need to move to a system whereby attacks British shared is as equally as possible\nAcross the income spectrum I'll show you know somebody making one dollar an hour let's say you should feel just as much of this country and he painted the system is the guy making all the money we don't have that what you have\nIs the only people painted on the rich the rich have every interest in every incentive to control the system and that's I think a big reason why money has prompted politics so much because the richer pay more and more into it and it's just they're basically is running the country because vast swaths of the population are\nParticipating in democracy anymore [noise]\nLatest survey I saw it said that was the most important issue to the people the number one issue isn't the economy that was number two the number one issue\nIs health care uh and it remains to number one issue or the economy being number two\nIt goes to show you how much health care coverage is costing employers costing individuals deductibles but that remains to number one issue that continues to go on addressed what's that all about\nYeah so I mean look this is actually a cost issue right I mean if you go back to the Obamacare debate a bombing was sold on this ate it it will lower premiums lower costs of middle class family I think the number given was twenty five hundred dollars your premiums would do that it hasn't\nWorked costs have gone up I'm just closing costs us a little bit\nBut that was happening before Obamacare So it's arguable whether or not Obamacare costs are not so\nThe big thing in my mind is that the people in the middle working squeeze on healthcare if you're very poorly of Medicaid if you're old you have Medicare and it's just to have to work and I have to pay for health care who are getting squeeze the most I I think we have a fundamentally broken system in the healthcare system I think it's kind of like you know we're we're half\nFrightening you know we we have all the\nProblems of a private system without any of the benefits and we have all the problems of the public system without any of the benefits you really have the worst of both worlds that makes sense you know we have the green of a private system\nCombined with the inefficiencies into bureaucracy of the public system but without any of their outside so we have this mixed system\nWithout any benefits um\nYou know it's it's really weighing down on the average consumer\nThanks again you know what one more thing to your listeners don't mind where we're looking at yourself look at everything don't listen to the ... read read read and you'll find your own true\nMm mhm I'm I'm I'm\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nDiamond seven oak long shot by American source for buying their brothers sold me\nFive seven [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Michelle branding us allies responding to the death of Washington Post journalist ... who died after entering the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month Germany's foreign minister saying it's time to rethink the sales of arms to Saudi Arabia\nBut we've been talking about how pain has a devastating effect on our overall health and now how her glucose mean cream this is a natural solution is a way to really get to the uh uh I guess the root cause that's right of pain in the body\nUm before we get into that Dr Janet I'm a I'm going to ask you I Know this is hard for you because this is this is emotional but I think it's important\nFor people to understand how you got to where you are today or why what what's driving by you and if you could share that ...\nIt was part that a lot of personal pain mhm and pain that my husband had years ago he had a severe I still arthritis throughout his body at the same time I had five on my house yah\nRight so I was really on a quest to find something all natural to help him have a better quality of life for myself as well I mean I had to function and raised three children during that time ...\n... let's talk a little bit about what's in your glucose mean yeah cream\nWell I did a lot of research on glucose I mean I knew how good it was\nSo I came across um the fact that Amy oil is a powerful natural anti inflammatory and can carry most any ingredient right through your skin and deliver relief to your area of pain okay\nI took any oil and glucose me mhm I used Boswell law which is an Indian herb that's an anti inflammatory okay we're on the line that's an enzyme known to be an anti inflammatory less than a natural organic solver\nThat is also just as important as glucose in Maine and rebuilding repairing our joints and so I put that altogether and ice cream that actually has no odor it's grace list it doesn't freeze the pain it doesn't burn the pain it doesn't irritate you scan\nGoes in Fifteen minutes later you have freely\nAnd so that's why I'm here to share what I Know and\nShowed I had right because it rice and I have this year by the way of folks glucose mean cream comes in a plastic dispenser that has pumped top on it\nTo ... to ... you'll need one to two pounds depending on the area okay of pain that there are a nation that sanitary you know ... nation say you don't have to worry about it becoming rancid okay\nNow I'm In terms of this getting into your body then you're talking about a couple of things right here not not only relieving the pain but also they don't read the rebuilding part so how does that work\nOnce you apply the cream to that area that you're going to target ... okay you get the information to go down in the body heal itself\nThe body heal itself provided you get at the raw materials that needs I'm giving you watch you made for your body to take over and do the job it was meant to do and that seal okay\nAnd this is safe enough and you have to worry about I have\nTo worry about a thing if you're taking a drug for pain it long conflict with that at all none of these ... going to do that\nOkay so what what is then a a realistic expectation if somebody calls today and and wants to try your glucose mean cream what would you tell them\nI Would say within the first Fifteen minutes you know then I noticed that your pain is greatly reduced or even eliminated okay and then over time you're going to rebuild and repair your joints with that information being taken down that's going to restore flexibility and mobility\nAnd sleep I mean if you can sleep again\nThat's where our bodies get all of our recoup protests regenerative ability to heal and then with that being taken care of all the things that you love to do you can start doing again traveling exercising so you can lose weight right socialize with family and friends you can be the life of the party\nYeah pain really changes who you are because of all these are the things you your can't do urge very difficult to deal with in terms of of living a normal life trying to live\nWell you can't you are right you can't live a normal life in your life has changed forever and get this thing taken care of and you can\nYeah and you've got people out there that are that are already getting great results\nHigh and brought some more emails and letters he'd like to hear issue or a cafe and let's see if Chris yes I'm from ... from California\nI Would love for you to know how happy I Am with your product my feet and legs are usually and pain from being overweight and on my feet all day at night I can hardly get to sleep from the pain I discovered by applying glucose me to the painful areas unable to get a good night's sleep thank you so much for making this possible\nHis one more Chris from Darlene from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nIt's a miracle in a tube that truly does take away the pain it works is nothing else I'd ever tried worked quickly and eliminated all of the pain\nSo to me when our leaves are these\nYou do these kinds of responses unusual\nNo really are the usual really usual I mean I must say that it does my heart good to hear these things because I Know what it's like to suffer and I know what it's like to get relief and every time you know I get one of these emails or these letters that just confirms that\nHundreds of thousands of people had to use my great results\nThat's great oh I've also want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr Janet's extra strength glucose mean pain relief formula there is a special toll free number to call give that to you know\nIt's one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven\nAs we've been talking about here Dr Janet's formula is a fast acting glucose mean cream that provides relief on contact for those

one two four seven eight seven and I'll give that to you again you're ready it's one eight hundred two one two four seven eight seven [noise]\nSo where do you think folks is a pretty interesting isn't it um you know pain obviously something that that is a huge epidemic in this country I don't think there's many of us or any of us for that matter that has not experienced pain from time to time or maybe it's more serious more chronic\nUm and looking for a real solution here understanding that perhaps the pharmaceutical approaches is now we know is not the best approach at this point because there\nAre so many side effects associated with a with these drugs out there but looking at it from a natural standpoint and Dr Janice glucose mean cream\nMaybe make some sense here I mean this is this is again putting back into your body we'd we'd do seem to discover time and time again that when you give your body what it needs it knows what to do with it and knows how to fix the problem it's only if it doesn't get those thing right that you continue the half the problem and\nAgain we've been talking about Dr ... cream and this is this is a number of ingredients that you put together right and and this this good for any type of pain\nIf you have pain of any kind it's kind of make a difference I mean I don't care how extreme is minimal it is it's going to get you with me\nNow it's more extreme of course it may take a little longer take your pain from ten to five and ... on the line with continue to use ... mind telling you that's very doable yeah so this has really exciting to be able to share this with you\nYeah again I think one of the things that is that is important for people to understand because very unique this is a cream yes this is not a supplement yeah there are lots of supplements out there and what do you tell someone that comes into your office and says well Dr Jana\nYou know I I've tried this I've tried that I've tried this I've tried to all of these things and it did not work so therefore the natural approach doesn't work\nFirst of all for ... or and ask them for that matter it takes Ninety Days for them to notice something if in fact they're going to notice anything because they may not be breaking down and absorbing the airline industry here taking into early to three months people gave up\nPeople in pain relief and why now right and that I developed this cream again Fifteen minutes and I am telling you you'll notice that it's going to the good ... and so I just gave you a challenge you know try it you have nothing to lose\nFour

a mission go there for and make disciples of oh nations baptize examined the name but the other end of the sun and the Holy Spirit teaching them to observe oh that I have commanded you\nThat's from the gospel of Matthew Jesus Christ of the word may flash and the sun as a father has an absolutely unique role in the salvation of the world\nLikewise the Catholic Church uniquely contains the means of continuing Christ saving ... our largest structure city apostles was a great call because those who became the first bishops and the first missionaries of the church\nThey were told to go to the nation's just those who did not know Christ and to proclaim the gospel\nBecause the apostles were faithful and obedience to the lurch command the church has grown and flourished\nOf course the responsibility for filling that mandate passes on an change to our bishops into all of the Catholics today so we're Catholic means universal\nThat tells us of God's purpose for his church he wants to extend to the farthest quarters of the earth he wants to show all people his love and mercy\nHowever our mission is far from complete there are many young\nChurches that need missionaries to develop and grow\nThere are many dioceses is ... and countries struggling with poverty persecution oppression war and it meant suffering\nThat needs missionaries to witness to the light and the love of Christ\nBringing hope to the future would cut to ...\nChrist to the nation's the idea of missions consists of continuing our Lord's omission mission comes from the Latin word meaning to send and it means obeying his command\nAlways to go to all the nations to baptize\nAnd to teach the face we look to Christ himself as a model of the truly loving missionary\nChrist was sent by the father he lived among people proclaimed the good news and he revealed the truth he took the burdens of all people upon himself and then carrying them to the cross he transformed all the time and hope people\nIn his resurrection we're saved threw him body and soul in Sacramento baptism and we\nCarry the good news of his love mercy and redemption to our homes our schools\nWorkplace fact everywhere we go we\nCarry this good news because God was everyone to be saved\nAnd you come to knowledge of the troops\nPersonal encounter with Christ especially in the Sacramento compels us to a greater participation in mission when we have been so wonderfully given we pass on to those who do not yet know of it or who stand in need of renewable\nAnd this sense every one of us was had a personal encounter with Christ has a heart of a missionary\nGod's desire for the salvation of all requires that we'd be missionary so there's no ... or anyone else or is there any other name under heavy give it to the human race by which we are to be saved that's from the book of acts\nChapter for first twelve\nMissionaries go forth and bring a church where it has not yet been found it and we build up churches that are struggling are missionaries carry with both the word in Sacramento in\nThe same message of Christ that was passed on to the apostles is not passed by missionaries to others\nThe same fervor for the

foods because we know how powerful this is imagine we could turn everything on a dime\nYeah I Know I live in a fantasy world sometimes but it really is important to see this concept because then you know what the potential is we are health care could become a non issue but we're not willing to do what it takes anyway\nI have a great deal of respect for modern medical professionals especially nurses are they often figure out the shortfalls modern medicine before the doctors do they've experienced it all first hand and when I meet a patients who are nurses or their knowledge is to me it interesting because they see both sides of it\nAnd then when they find out that they can improve their health through good diet\nIt's like a whole new world open up to them\nSo I'm particularly excited about today's show in a short time I'll be introducing a special guest a friend a patient somewhat I have a great deal of respect for I think she's lived the life that I Know God would smile upon\nShe's here to share her health restoration story and maybe a little bit more with us\nAnd uh so you can benefit by her experience and I know she's excited to be here too so we'll bring her in and the second half of the show so we're probably not going to have time for any phone calls and the second half of the show I Apologize and it'll last week we left a couple of calls on the board couldn't get to them but um there's a lot of information to get across in one hour and I'm hoping maybe\nSooner or later we can go to a two hour show and I can really expand on a lot of different ideas but\nOK real quick announcement I'll be speaking and about health and how you can achieve incredible health\nOn Saturday in November seventeenth at six PM at trinity Lutheran Church in Gerard I don't know what it is about Georgia UPS or guys in Georgia got me to come up and talk and now one of the churches and Gerard so it's a good thing must be some health minded people there\nSo it's free and open to the public if you'd like to meet me in person and here's some amazing health knowledge that you probably won't hear anywhere else make plans to be there that's November seventeenth six PM at trinity Lutheran Church Seventy eight east liberty street and Gerard\nAnd there's no charge for that and I think you'll find that people there are very open and friendly so am I speaking dates are somewhat limited so if you'd like they have me speak at your group or church or wherever call my office to set a date call three three zero for eight to nine five five zero\nFor eight to nine five five zero if we don't answer leave a message was the number and I promise you will call you back\nSo again folks I Am a chiropractic physician I mostly or in my living by helping patients get rid of back pain neck pain joint pain things like that I also take pride in showing people how to prevent it [noise]\nMy wife Denise and I are the practice or we may be a bit unusual in that we've been married for thirty seven years plus\nAnd that we work together in the office for at least thirty two of those years since I've been a practice and uh I guess ... says something about her ability to put up with me I'm sure she would agree with that but\nEvery one of our patients is treated like we'd like to be treated if you're you know in our office you are not a number or a case and our patients become our friends I think most of them would tell you that and because of that we'd go the extra dishonest and help you reach your health goals in any way that we can\nSo called Denise if you have a back neck or joint issue or or if you want to sit down and talk to me about your health and how diet can improve your health overall I'm telling you it is the most powerful thing you could ever do for your health\nSo whether you want chiropractic care or you're interested in our health restoration program called Denise for an appointment Monday through friday nine to six\nOr at three three zero for eight to nine five five zero that's for eight to nine five five zero so for some reason again if we don't want to answer leave a message with a phone number and made sure speak clearly sometimes it's hard to hear you folks are and we'll call you back I promise\nOr so now I Want to talk to you about something really important\nFlu shots so now you're probably waiting for me to say you need to go get your flu shot as soon as you can and it's true it does take a couple of weeks for the immunity to build after you get the shot a supposedly but [noise] anyway\nUh I Know you've been hearing the commercials for the shots there everywhere it's almost like it must be supported by our government or something and funded by our government and my bet is that most of it is\nBut uh anyway the the commercials are everywhere and of course it's flu season which really is a misnomer flu viruses are around all year but from October through February it is worse in a flu season actually peaks from December through February or march\nAnd it's widely accepted that flu is worse in the winter months uh mostly because of dry air allows the moisture droplets that flu viruses hitch a ride on to travel from one person to another much more easily a are more efficiently\nAnd that they they're able to stay in the air longer and drier air so you know your heat or you're forced air in your house and things that all contributes to it but you know make no mistake probably the biggest thing that contributes to flu being contagious or highly contagious this time of year is\nIn these months we like to gather in groups indoors and close together you know holiday power parties and things like that\nAnd so um you know that's a major factor in its second and largely a big part of the problem is that this time of year our immune systems really are beat into submission by the way we eat and drink and the things that we do too many parties too much alcohol too many fatty sugary foods\nAnd I'll tell you that that has a huge influence on your immune response to your ... your body's ability to fight the flew off\nAnd so you should keep that in mind\nSo I'm not really going to spend a lot of time on this I was going to mention it today [noise] but uh we have a lot to cover and so next week I'm going to do a show mostly around this flu idea\nAnd a just a couple of quick things so you know this time of year when we have a a lots of flu it it's also the time of year when heart attacks and strokes bike around the holidays\nAnd they blame it on stress which yeah I think is ridiculous dress really as an outcome of the poor diets we have been the lack of exercise habits and things and the decrease sunlight and a winner and all that so you know the same thing that affects depression but those things also suppress your immune system\nAnd so look get started now and maybe the flu won't be a problem just a you know I'm not here to tell anybody to get or to not get the flu shot that your own personal decision\nI'll tell you that I haven't had one in forty years and I've had the flu twice in forty years and the last time I got it was really mild compared to everybody else around me\nSo I'll tell you that your immune system has a lot to do with it and there is some chance involved a life is full of risk nothing you can do will make you totally bullet proof\nAnd so viruses are always a problem so we'll talk more about the flu virus next week and you make sure you tune in because I'll have some information that\nElse really has some good stuff\nSo I Want to mention one other thing today I Am so excited you know there was actually a few restaurants around here that have at least a couple of plant based options or more plant based options on their menus\nKind of like half heartedly you know they have things for vegetarians or vegans or whatever people just watching how much meat date but\nThere's one that stands out above all the rest and that's a lagging eatery\nUnless you live in a cave I'm sure that you know a Mediterranean diet is considered to be one of the healthiest ways divvy\nTo eat and uh there's a lot of pluses to Mediterranean diet I think there's a couple of little drawbacks oils can be an issue but for the most part Mediterranean diet is that helpful way to go it is probably a hundred times healthier than way you eat day in and day out\nSo while you're working to improve your diet and reducing the amount of meat and cheese and dairy and sugar and things\nI think about a a lens eatery because they have a huge variety of things they also have beef and chicken tuna and some other meats are but there really is no excuse when you go there that you can't find something to eat there was a little bit of something for everybody but they have I'm excited because they have a lot of good\nLike a more vegetarian more plant based choices and I know the only own or\nA or a Simone a really who now is a sponsor for my show enjoy incredible health was Dr ...\nIs a perfect fit for this show because she has such a strong commitment to health and one of these days I'm going to get her on the show because she'll talk about her health experience and how she fixed her own health if some of her family did the same thing\nIs just an incredible story and her commitment to your health is much like mine and there's nothing like getting like minds together I'll tell you so you go to a lens eatery when you go there tell them Dr ... co sent you they'll probably no you know about the relationship to the show and uh I mean\nWe just came out from summer we can and this is\nOkay yeah we'll get back to it here when we come back thanks realism folks will be right back with the [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nCall today and let's get storey\nIn the valley firefighters in Trumbull county are looking into what caused the house to catch on fire dispatchers tell us the blame broke out just for three

go\n\nGay were back in and all the excitement or I guess they forgot to ah talk about exactly what Jan achieved in her her ah improving her blood health and so\nWhat was it five weeks that it was between blood tests for you yeah so and so in five weeks you lower your total cholesterol from two sixty four to one eighty nine seven right and then that's that's like Seventy five\nPoints yeah and what what's exciting is that when the doctor's office called and they said your cholesterol is high and they gave me that what it was that and they said he must position and let the tour and I said no [laughter]\nAnd they said well well then well I they said what are you going to do and I said well give me a few weeks and they said we'll give you six weeks and I couldn't wait\nA minute by about it because you knew what China or yeah\nThat's so cool or you know your doctor probably lost a little bit of love for you [laughter] and you said no because doctors don't like to be told no you know they want you to comply and mostly it's because they care about us and and they wanted us to be healthy at all but\nThey well I'm On behalf of my doctor ... he was excited even like ...\nAnd or or have had an appointment on friday and had his blood work done [laughter] and he said it was the doctors fault [laughter] this is your your husband or right right and well\nAnd uh so well you know we'll we'll work on her role trying to bring him along a little bit so\nThat the doctor said you know he said you know she's lowered her cholesterol Seventy five points and the doctor was so happy yeah some\nYeah and I know your doctor and I know he's a good hearted yeah and and they all I think are\nAnd it's just that some of his foreign to them and and honestly it's not that they don't want you to do it it's partly that some of them are lacking this knowledge and no fault of their is they've been hit their head buried in the books for years and with patients and they do what they do very well\nBut you know this requires a whole different line of thought\nAnd so but to do really great thing I think is that the more patience like you know do this and you approve your health aid goes to your doctor and I've had this multiple times in our area so there's probably doctors Ron here they're probably getting ready to hang yellow you that are\nOne of these days are going to call and say hey what are you doing with patients and uh but you know things that we can do to encourage that whole process along the way\nAnd you know and I don't want to take any credit for this all votes all I did was write the book jammed actually did this on her own\nAnd she is a a chiropractic patient of mine but she\nYou know this is something that you know she read the book she applied and that's what I tell you all the time I'm not here for me I'm here every week because I Want you to be healthier and things like this really excite me more than anything because this shows me that the average person not saying your average I think you're above average [laughter] but\nYou know the average person is fully capable of taking any information applying it and doing wonders things it's incredible and so now I see you as a beacon to wear your family is there any other family members that are going hey you know would you do you know anything like that are you\nMy my daughter watches and that's what a lot of people did they just watch they they really don't question you know they'll watch and they'll make it make comments you know oh you've lost weight or whatever and they don't always ask why or what 'cause they know tell them [laughter]\nSo how how much weight did you lose their eyes five weeks this time and twenty five pounds you know I was twenty five and I'm Still losing so were you starving the whole time\nOr in not hungry I'm an eater I'm a I'm a farm girl and I was raised on a farm in ...\nI eat anything and everything yeah and that's how I was raised and then when I found out that wasn't necessarily good for me right um but I I and I cook so I Know and that's what I was saying before the break\nYou know we had the garden so there is a lot of vegetables I can my own vegetables and you don't have to can with salt yeah I Know yeah you can just put them in jars and you've got them for the whole winter but we have at our fingertips good grocery stores with good produce\nAnd far markets I always plug the farmer ... so let's talk about that flavors thing because what do you mean you don't need a lot of salt so uh you know the salt pretending understand as a preservative and goes and you've got to think about that if a lot of salt keeps the bacteria from growing and maybe it's not such a helpful thing overall but\nSo are the flavor thing go do fine foods to be flavorful enough for you\nI found out that they have their own flavor [laughter] amazing you don't need better you don't need so you don't need cream sauces right I just we we corn on the ... now and I just I eat a plane that's\nThe way I my ... yeah and uh you know ... that something else I hear from people all the time that you know it's so much more flavorful than I ever thought it was and it does take a little while for your taste buds to clear out because\nI I Believe we kinda over burden or taste buds over the years with all the butter and salt and things and you don't have an appreciation for real taste of vegetables and fruits and things\nAnd I am a salt fanatic also have to be able to to cut that off and actually taste and and enjoy might said it that's great\nRight now and you know salt is an issue where a ... there was\nSalts and nerves sodium chloride sodium chloride his table salt and that's the one that we're all familiar with the potassium is something we need much more open our
