the Pentagon received suspicious envelopes what appears to be rice and Secret Service has said that the envelope was addressed the President Trump deemed suspicious\nSo I think they let James Madison open it but um anyway a Trump doesn't open his own male anyway\nBut you might recall that there was a similar case in twenty Thirteen to twenty fourteen and there was a Mississippi man and a leader a Texas woman were caught sending the um the rice and they're now in prison twenty five an Eighteen years\nFor sending this here's a story about this so you think rice and rice and is so toxic that just touching it can kill you and make you very sick and as far as we know there's absolutely no antidote for racing right\nBut you know we forget about these things how we go through the ... the some of these ... things that are still people out there that would try some of those um none of the suspicious envelopes reached their intended destination\nBeing flag and screening the envelopes to the Pentagon were addressed to the defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson\nAll the letters are no longer a threat in both the FBI is Secret Service or non ...\nAm I my question would be with the thousands of pieces of mail that should get how would someone determine that this was a deadly substance and being able to afford it\nI mean you know it has not exactly been on the front page but you know we're so critical of everybody in Washington DC and I've been that way too from time to time but I think these people they have to go on every day like there is a threat coming yeah you have to be prepared for a threat\nYou and and then that's the way a lot of federal agencies are set up to prepare for threats and especially for the Pentagon I mean they hate their military there used to the idea of having to protect your perimeter so if they do I'm sure they have a secure male facility\nWhere they screen them for radiological and chemical problems and

our biggest threat back then was what a case of a nuclear weapon\nNow the Russians are coming and that sort of thing yeah we're all worried that the that the uh you know they\nYou know now the Russians ... or something like the Russians are here and uh they're blowing insulation in our houses\n[laughter]\nAlthough I was in the Russians are here and\nUh yeah what what what did they call

emergency broadcast system and then they did you pass [laughter]\nNow um they have come up with this um and I guess if there's any folded at all is that people like you and I who wear headphones when these things come down and we do a test\nAnd uh they're really hard on the ears you know the the noises they make but they need to have those tones and those tones trigger a various stations throughout the country and most of them are\nUnless you're out there with a no cell service and I tell you that I was in that area there's places in Ohio with no cell service yeah Pennsylvania to\nThere are a there's a place a I encountered frequently it's right on the state line and it it's just an odd place were calls will drop out all the time\nYou know that's when you go to your paper map if you have at throwing it out of your car [laughter] you try reading of paper you you think do you think texting as bad do you think taxing\nAs dry unfolding of paper map but yeah that on the car

and then of course there was AAA or you get out and get a trip pick\nI think I still have a couple of those stuffed in a pocket in my in my car or somewhere yeah\nThat has tripled AAA for about Twenty years yeah\nI can only think of using it one time for a dead battery and the lights on here at these football really yeah huh so but um I don't know you keep these things I don't even know if it's necessary but had little insurance 'cause I used to drive to New York a lot yeah I mean I'd say OK on I'm going to drive a need to be ... so we get keep these things\nAre out yeah I mean think about the cost of ... you know if you're it mean that in itself if you had to pay for that and they would pay for the\nCost of your for later I was watching the debate last night between your gubernatorial candidates for the night before yeah of much of a debate really no they they're sitting side by side everybody tries to new format and uh\nUh I thought the best one that the best form it they had was at the University of Dayton a couple of weeks ago\nWhen uh the TV anchor was very strict or Ninety seconds for wine and clarity second re bottle for Cordray and then ... seconds for Cordray thirty second bubble for the wind and it was very specific to the questions and things like that you have to be somewhat disciplined if we're going to do it\nYes yeah I mean that ... and if you if you hold them to the format like that and you keep the ... questions very specific and don't let them wander you can actually have a pretty good to bail\nNow the other form it I like and he very seldom would you get two candidates to agree to something like this but I'm very light help from the moderator such as myself and let the two candidates question each other\nYeah that we can get people to agree that that that is I'm not only entertaining but it is and wiping\nYeah there is that there that that is a a variation on what in in a competitive debating is called a Lincoln Douglas debates okay and that were they were the one on one with somebody now and there is some rules for that too I mean you're given a certain amount of time each each side yeah so\nYeah in Michael really on yesterday and I'm Michael really was\nUm on the debate team in high school and then he went to college were debating so he's pretty good really yeah yeah he's very brief but by the way just a program note a Viking tells me run to go to phone calls during the second I'm Michael really on yesterday\nA John Boccieri who's running for Senate he's on tomorrow the same time nine o'clock tomorrow morning and the same format\nI used to be bring people in and um you know you go back and forth with each other\nBut I've kinda sourdough that format because um\nYou know ... years never enough time to really get the the full answers out unless you're going to clear out all the commercials and just let people talk to each other yeah I think you've you've got to watch it but I kind of like the format that we're doing right now where I come in I get to know like in question them and um and you get a little bit of an insight into or where they're going to go\nYeah well yeah that's that's more flexible and jumps of having a fit into your format and yeah\nYou got it All right and ... and you know I've I've grown so tired of the um the fake debates that they have on CNN and Fox or were they bring in um this opinion in that opinion and you know they've already decided how it's going to go before then and you're you're just being played as you're watching this in my opinion\nWell yeah and but at the end there too you know there are two brief I mean these are these a three minute segments that they will do for a minute segments and and you it it sometimes you find them yet a shouting over each\nOther highly produced and you come in and they say you take this position I'm going to go over here I'm going to start with you you know what\nThis is it is it's no good for me anyway um but they some people like it ... maybe I Will start liking it again after I take about six months off from Fox and CNN that's what I that's that's kind of where I Am right now although I had been watching showing a

not much has been talked about it but um I brought up earlier this morning but the the city of Youngstown is trying to get ten point eight million dollars in federal funding\nFor parents shuttle that would go around and what they want to do they want to do a shuttle car door conducting the anchor institutions like Youngstown State mercy hill the business incubator and I would imagine the former far more building\nAnd uh they think that this thing fits the bill for what they're looking James kid ... who's the director of escape regional development which submitted the ten point eight million dollar bill grant in July and um\n[noise] the build all wars will be announced in the next month\nAnd they're thinking that uh they can do this and I know the question that most of you would ask right now is\nThis something that we need it certainly would make the city look better but I Want to remind you of what happened to Cincinnati they put a trained in\nAnd they went to Germany and Spain and bought the trains the trains are falling apart nobody is writing them and they're having a hell of a time maintaining it it is one big mess it is a huge controversy in Cincinnati\nWas this like a small scale train kind of thing\nWhere no it was it was an actual trained people would ride down through mountain square and it still exist and people\nWere not writing them up\nAnd [noise]\nMy heart

a it's an electric vehicles looked like a little mini bus [laughter] not very big and it runs autonomously on a loop around this this development and uh you know they obviously have private money they're using for that but ... and worse\nAnd the question is what would anybody use it in in Youngstown\nYeah I mean I I I think about the need if you have ten point eight million dollars it's been and I know we put it into different buckets these gay develop it gets so much they can appeal to the federal government but you have this project can't stand on its own merits if this project is not needed\nThis ... this should not happen not when you're in the death like we're in in right now I've got a whole two pages of pork that I've been reading every day when we come back here everything from a you know putting treadmill in there for shrimp to see how they do on the on treadmills and cause big money because you have to have a secretary and you have to set up\nAn office and you know you have to be a Bible once he drew whatever you know and all that crap but you know and I I'm not a dream crush or and maybe I could be convinced but my my initial thought is\nYou're talking about spending ten million dollars in Youngstown\nI think the best thing you could do to improve Youngstown right now just knocked down the unneeded housing\nWell that that's probably right up at the top but don't forget they're building an amphitheater to right and that sort of I mean all these things that aren't really necessary\nI can justify the amphitheater in this in this thing I'm In this way you may be able to attract more people as a quality of life issue downtown\nRight now we're an automobile society mhm Youngstown is not a big traffic jam area no I mean you know what you can pretty much get to the university you could walk it you can um you can take a car you can find this is not like parking um you know in forty second street\nYou know who might use this shuttled in more than anybody else would\nBe a university students I think for those\nIn there the last I knew that they need the exercise [laughter] I mean really I mean you know you've got these people in here that they're they're not walking yet that's the first thing people do and they go out and they play golf oh let me get an a cart know here here's a chance for you to walk\nAnd you can't it can't appeal to people to be not lazy I mean you know they're going to do it\nYeah but I'm not going to aid them and given them ten million dollars where's that ten million dollars coming from well I'm\nThe east coast develop but they are funded by these rats were coming from the federal government does that come from the meager taxes that I sat in they're going to take part of that maybe it will be down to the tenth of a penny that they are going to take from this but they're going to take some of this money and I I just we got to put the brakes on a similar um\nLet's see your point of getting I'm getting more like a RV in the afternoon you know aren't the best place for your money is in your own pocket I can hear Ron saying that in my ear and stuff like that I'm not that far because I I Do think there are some worthy projects out there may be self serving in a lot of waste because uh you know I think that if you have a amphitheater out there\nAnd you've got somebody that knows what they're doing like Eric Brian he may be able to turn it into a profit center and the people may enjoy going out and doing a picnic and it may improve the looks of your downtown but shuttle come on I mean\nDifficult is to get her I said for that ten point eight million dollars you could give everybody in the city and electric wheelchair\n[laughter] wait a second it conjures up a mental image sheer [laughter] right electric well here's here's the thing all over the downs on there and I am I ready\nAm I right folks I usually get everybody electric wheelchair and for those of us who could handle it or give me one of those little motorized scooter okay when I went to Washington DC I told my wife is it that's my next purchase and she said oh no it isn't [laughter] that's why there I'm going to get one of those electric motor scooters 'em and they looked like there'd be a lot of fun to write\nIn fact I hop a curb and and then all hell breaks loose\nAnd I just done a couple of years ago I restored my son's Honda urban express a it was when I was in Nineteen eighty four model of a hundred urban express and um he no longer nice um let's see if I can somehow a spirit that back to the young sounds so I can be running around like less ...\nLet me know how that goes right yeah I think the interesting\nSpy biking um give me the best possible calls that we can put on the air here we go blind number one good morning you're on five Seventy WKBD in\nThe morning and um I watch the hearings for start to finish I watched a lot of the ah voting the next day and what senators had to say\nAnd I thought I had seen it all but now I say more machinations tricks by the Democratic party and here's what they are ice\nIce cubes so now we threw ice Brett Kavanaugh through ice in a bar interestingly a police report was filed about the ice however even more interesting late\nChristine Blasey Ford never found a report none of her character people that have testimony supposedly ... against Brett Tom and I ever found a report and then the case of sweat next time she went back where there were gang rapes and never found a report that's my first point\nSecond point yeah books so now Senator Whitehouse wants to go back to his high school yearbook for news that is the main crux of as not being quiet [laughter] this is ridiculous not been qualified for the Supreme Court but interestingly\nHer your book has been described in your cat fine and trees finally polygraph this is the new one now she said and the herrings I have never\nAsked anybody in a polygraph test no ever taken alive now there is an ex boyfriend saying she has coach someone in the past with a polygraph test and they're they are calling for an investigation on this phone Chuck Grassley just some interesting points that I knew that I thought folks would like to now\nYou know I think everything out there is um interesting but the one that I think is the most interesting is that your book\nBecause uh if you go to Washington pundit or D.C pundit you can find that your book now the names are redacted so in other words they have taken this and they put that on line at least it was on line\nOr a week ago from Sunday when I was reading it\nAnd you can go back and these folks out there were promoting drinking they were promoting the fact that these kids were going to do what they were going to do and the teachers were part and parcel now there are pictures of lousy forward in that\nBut uh the the her her name is blocked out obviously to protect a youth so I think that that's still out there but you know what let's go back to this\nLook look look where we have come ... where we're down you were talking about your books and throwing ice cubes\nAnd we've got a country that has got one foot and a banana peel when it comes to economics [laughter] it's it is unbelievable they did it is\nUnbelievable and finally one more thing I'll say Tom Cotton snout are\nCalling for an investigation into everything about the holding back to the document lawyering up who knew who leaked all that stuff wonderful but that investigation will never\nCome to fruition if the Democrats gain any control and either the two houses because they will squelch it especially the Senate so that's even more reason to get those Republicans reelected gain some seats because quite frankly\nI thought she was ... polish and I want to know what really happened\nYeah I missed that ... to polish because of the way she was talking was a kind of all I don't know if you ever made a dissertation when she was a going for a PHD I mean really the way she headed holding speech and ... got to talk but let's say thank you for your call by Seventy WKBD him at the Denver when I don't know but\nPolished I wouldn't call it polish no she seemed I mean ... a lot of people said oh she sounded credible window she sounded shaky to me you know I I you know is if yeah she was traumatized now when she was traumatized we don't know yeah I mean when that was but then again that could have been a part of a a coaching sessions she had to how to appear who knows\nThese things are all nerve wracking of Richard Cordray was nervous the other night I was watching him on the debate I'm Down in uh eastern Ohio none Marietta um he had some shakes going on you\nBut how you could have some people get like that are on stage situation yeah but the the Joe and Joe or right you've got thirty days when you're going to have to make a statement and you're going to go back and you're going to make a decision on senators and Congress\nYou know what books if you want more of the same and you want this mess that we have come to find out\nJust put just putting a Democrat Senate and the Democrat house and this whole place will get nothing done for the next two years up for it is going to happen [noise]\nLook at it I don't think it's going to happen though because I think you folks are smarter than that just as your proof when you um went up to the Trump and again if Hillary Clinton had been elected do you think that you would have a better agreement or NAFTA\nShe wouldn't she wouldn't even touched that

white men or media Dutch Guyana [noise]\nLegally long how\n\n\n\nMuch you can imagine when you're doing over the line not everybody agrees with\nMy boy Joe's point um and a Viking gyms and you know the populist pretty much is a from conservatives right now is that a you know what we get an election to win and thirty days we've got to come back here and we got to put more conservatives back in or we're going to have a a mess and nothing's going to be done I think there's some validity to that thought in that um\nYou know folks if you're you're a liberal up there\nAnd uh you voted for Hillary Clinton\nAren't you really enjoying the benefits of the Trump Administration\nYou buy any criticism of the drop administration is they haven't kept their eye on the debt debt continues to grow\nAnd that we're feeling good but we did pretty much the same thing during the Obama administration we did this quantitative easing where we continue to buy her own debt back in to prop up the markets until we got to where we are right now that we're spending a trillion more than we have so um but here's the thing about it if you're a liberal\nAnd you're out there working such as a steel worker somebody of give it the analogy though that you look at these steel workers are they've got the signs up for this was all supporting Democrats get Donald Trump is the one that is helping you get more orders\nDonald Trump is the the reason that people have now got the attention of NAFTA and\nGet rid of the world Trade Organization deal and many others and we're we're fighting back\nKind of Trump is doing it for you\nDo you think that Hillary Clinton and uh and I got to do it the only thing I ever heard from congressman Tim\nIs that he said that the Chinese were manipulating their money for you their currency for years and years and years\nHe kept saying that and just saying that and kept saying that in the tiny goes huh [laughter] Oh yes and that that this right Mr damp but they didn't do a thing about it no no not not not one thing not one thing did you ever hear until Donald Trump said look what puts a piece of this because the Chinese reading our lunch\nWhen they're not stealing our cyber security when they're not a out they're stealing our intellectual property they're out they're destroying us on tariffs so that's good that Trump's has no more of this no more of this\nBut if you are to be honest with me and I know not everybody loves my viewpoint here but the thing about it if Hillary Clinton had become president\nDo you think that this country would now have Kim John own sitting and talking to South Korea\nTo you know I don't believe the guy but he says he's going to take apart ... at least you can give me this he's not firing missiles over Guam\nWe now have a better I don't even know the details on the entire agreement to people talk about well you get the dairy farmers and are not going to have open markets in Canada um maybe so um we got a better deal where we're going to have more parts made in the United states with this NAFTA agreement\nSo you've got all that ... that has happened during the Trump Administration\nWould not have happened if in fact you had had more of the same more of the Obama administration from Hillary Clinton\nWould wouldn't happen now with the V. no engagement in on the Korean Peninsula to try to end that decades old conflict\nI can remember when ISIS was lining people up by the sea slicing their throats it was a very bad time folks and for some reason whatever it is you got to say some of it belongs to Donald Trump because he's in charge right now\nISIS doesn't have the power they wants that not no doubt that they will real they're ugly hit shore and they'll come back and they'll hit us somewhere\nBut our military had day was on shackled yeah by the Trump Administration and they said you folks wage war however us feel fit to get rid of ISIS yeah and guess what\nYou did yeah so it's just it's down now it's an ideology those it's going to come back onto the smartest guy in the world but I can see that things are better than they were towards the tail end of the Obama administration and you're going to have a decision to make are you going to put in conservatives are you going to give the liberals back\nOr just to get even with Trump I don't know when you look at West Virginia and places like uh Joe Manchin would be crazy to vote against the Supreme Court nominee when he and he would be you know in any way politics is not my favorite topic but we do it from time to time here's a here's an interesting though that should not everybody agrees with me and that's okay\nBut he says uh on the Supreme Court fiasco let's put the blame squarely or it belongs this is up on the ... the shoulders of Mitch McConnell\nWho is orchestrated this entire debacle it's fine for him to hold an opening\nOpen on the Supreme Court an opening open on the Supreme Court for an excess of the year when a Democratic president is offering to fill the vacancy albeit with a hundred percent consensus candidate had judge Garland been confirmed as he should have Trump would have come forward with ...\n... was a quality individual who sailed through confirmation the attempt to pack this court for ideological reasons within ill tempered political hack from the Bush administration may succeed in the short term\nBut there will be a long term price to pay was sir I Am certainly not convinced\nSir or madam that and then that's text messages and I want to get those out there I'm not convinced that this guy's a hack uh if you look at his adult life the guy has a remarkable career\nAnd he has people that have worked for him that they are in all of how fair he has been\nWhat do you know what a way what

do I know that's an interesting that I hadn't read that because uh the thought was is that when she was remodeling the house she wanted more doors even though they didn't fit in because she wanted an escape route and you're saying that that is not true\nOr ... ... it's it's all it's all coming out now as a last night they were breaking stories with\nA there was a doctor a psychologist ... lived there before\nThey were renting the house before they bought it so this came up for\nA two thousand twelve when she told the therapist the therapist didn't write down the name ... it's just it's just

phobia something new maybe I mean try to give her the benefit of the doubt\n\nWell we'll just like the benefits that Trump is giving the country at war or we'll just sit back and wait yeah don't yelling about it I I think the only reason that Trump a felt like he could say stuff during the speech\nLast night is because of this stuff is coming out of the thing I here's of I think my my role is is I don't think\nThat I can beat people over the head with the the Trump train I really don't I can just honestly and um you know loudly speak about the benefits that we have gained here in the country\nOf overall I think things are much better and I think that you know what if you think that Trump has belligerent and that you're not going to vote for him because he's mean to women and the people around him and he says crude things I'm probably not going to be able to convince you but maybe I can convince you just don't being pragmatic\nYour your four O. one K. is are better you're able to get your Medicare or Medicaid um things are moving in a favorable condition when it comes to the defense of this country I can just to give you the facts I'm not going to be able to loudly beat you over the head and say you got to do this I just don't think it works\nIt doesn't work but if you do a good job that you're doing anything out higher says pointing out that deals with Russia pointing out um what's going on in in Korea where they the north and south say they're going to get together\nAnd we'll hear on the other night on here's another thing that I can point out to you know I'm I've all I've always said you know I Know congressman Tim Ryan I Know his brother they're pretty nice people you know and I've had had a Tim on my show but the thing about it is that Tim basically has been talking about Chinese manipulating the currency\nFor the last I don't know five ten years nothing has really come of his job moaning about it and know how we're going to hold them accountable now Donald Trump comes in and says\nI'm not putting up with this crap from the Chinese were going to tear up the materials that are coming in here we're going to get them to the table that's how you do it now you know Congressman Ryan was saying well you know we've got to stop this currency manipulator they're cheating their ... you know what you know what effect that had on them almost nothing almost nothing\nNothing and until you actually do something to you a ... ... what was the what was the ... well they hold so much of our debt that we can't we can't say anything about it it\nWas a nurse and the eight and shake anything else I gotta go but uh what else do you do anything\nThat says search Cape are beating the drum networks won't change everybody's mind but uh keep everybody on the training going the right direction ...\nTrying to give you the ... thank you very much appreciate it I feel like John Adams sitting out there\nIn the left field the Cleveland Indians beating the drum being thrown as I I just can't imagine folks you you're making making a change thirty days from now and going back and say well we're going to throw all these Republicans up because things are just too good let's go to our next call here on five Seventy W given good money you're on the air\nWhat is going on with the channel can project now\nWell now wait a minute you do have in from I got some information but what's your information well\nI'll tell you why I'm calling they blocked my favorite street to hit the freeway\nKnow those those streets are not that great down there what are your group as a\nLock for street so I Can't go straight into the freeway\nLittle fattening lane I'm Sorry I got a lock out\nA way to more red light which ... which is not bad but it puts me in the middle of fruit straight we're a little off the street has three lanes and then and then on a street by street there waiting to make my turn to freeway\nCars are crying up oak street going ... if they make a right hand turn them in the middle of the street they're very uncomfortable\nNever going to get out you know you can I tell you something\nDo I mean if we get the two hundred and fifty jobs that they're promising down there I think you would be willing to go around and say I'll I'll be inconvenienced some fruit street\nI'm all for a job but I wanted to stay away from ... checks for a minute and Jeff seriously why did that street half could be cut 'em and still is why I guess\nThey're doing down there on the good connections\nWell here in Harlem ... of this but it's fine and here's my thought on this\nIs that a Mr Joseph and company they have architectural firms down there and they've decided what they need to make this efficient\nMaybe it was that street that needed to be closed and that is the tack that they have taken I always think it's almost like um minimum wage people are saying trying to tell other people how to run their businesses you know if Joseph has the permits and the zoning changes and he he's ... he's actually going to take down\nThat big building down there you know the the building down by um\n[noise] oh no no no no no Viking what's a paid rose um what's the genesis\nYeah you've got to build a garage you're going to take that down there is some reason the need to take it down but here's what I Know about the ... there's been not much activity down there\nAfter an idea I Know I'm right here but\nYeah but I Do hear commercials running now or Mr Joseph as a as a commercial and the white issue games that he's saying that this is going to be a production and research facility it's full steam ahead so I'm going to take him at his word it hasn't moved as quickly as we could some people said that they ran out of money I don't I've never been able to confirm that\nBut um they said basically it's a ... commercials these are the things going forward so let's be ...\nOne thing real quick from camel downtown Youngstown there must be five

street lights are out and here's the thing about it I think we're going to see more of that simply based on this and I taught I was talking to friends last night and said you know what we don't know what we don't know\nThe tax base in Youngstown is anemic simply because people are leaving\nDrive through the east side where he's talking about near the ... there are so many houses that need to be raised in I mean raised quickly if you're going to spend ten million dollars on an autonomous transport between Youngstown in St Louis and around the city\nLet's see if we can reprogram the money to
