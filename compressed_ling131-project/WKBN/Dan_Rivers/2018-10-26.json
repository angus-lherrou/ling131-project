hear on football already I just got a note here that um they just put out a release for doing Canfield and Poland that they have reached an agreement\nBetween Canfield local school district in Poland local to continue their athletic rivalry yeah there was some but I think maybe there are these skipping next year and then they're back in twenty twenty there'll be back on schedule\nFor varsity football right good rivalries that that's a really makes an area does it really does kind of fun ... you know Austin Town board been that type of thing [noise]\nGood deal though right Dan rivers on five Seventy WKBD in two shot overnight another another sad tale for our city of Youngstown and are you thinking about these things and um they almost go without notice anymore don't they\nThey have become so common in this country that are just just just a very sad state of affairs that we have that\nHappening all the time you know reach back and I think about um what I said yesterday and it's interesting is I was thinking more about it and kind of been large dip on my idea and that was\nThe issue of how we fund schools\nAnd you think about we have teachers now in Poland and they're not the first I Would like to have a raise\nAnd you know the first thing that I said is that you know they're seeking a one present Braves I mean it's not much I mean what what's inflation could be two or three I mean there are people always say if you have your money in the bank or losing money every day and everybody does deserve a raise here as inflation marches on\nBut here's where I I wanted to make this point again today where icy seal school systems and\nMost of us don't have time to get into the nuances of how schools are funded\nTo me that's an entire discipline if you're a school board member just to think about what you can and cannot do they have made it so complicated that goes well beyond just a reduction in force\nBut that's where I think that we should be really having the most talk here reduction in force and I'll tell you here here's the foot thinking on this and I like to see if I have a consensus on this\nMost of the school districts in the Youngstown Warren area or stable or they are losing students we have information that projects how much they are expected to grow or lose over the years\nI think this is a very simple concept to follow ... since we've been talking about the public school system why not just take into consideration and in large on the pragmatism that I said yesterday that I was talking about yesterday\n[noise] if in fact you want to raise the rate the rate raise the wages in your school district you have to find the money either by a reduction in forces or you have to cut basketball football all of these kinds of things\nDoesn't that makes sense because if you go back and you look at the history of this we have taken the taxes\nToo and it to to a level to where we are funding the schools also tell board on polling how when a court wasn't champion all of these were funding these ended stable\nSo if people are comfortable with the homes that they were having and the amount of money that they are using to fund these schools why do we always go back to them and say that they should be pitching in more money when the district is not growing\nWhen the\nAmount of money that people are making is typically not going up why do we simply think that will go back and ask them to contribute more\nBecause I think that there could be a simple three or four step way to do this what you would essentially do is say OK we get it you want more money\nOkay we're going to give you more money but we're going to have to have an equal reduction in force to make sure that we have the money because we can't go back to the taxpayers and ask them for more money\nAnd then if it continues like this and you become small enough the final step would be that you would have to find a like minded school district that would be willing to merge with you\nSo in the case of polling maybe it'd be Struthers maybe it'd be a law ville maybe it'd be a new Middletown but that's how you could do this and make it very simple instead of going back let's just say that a popular amount of um school funding every year is two thousand dollars per taxpayer\nSo you reached that level the two thousand dollars per taxpayer and you simply say that's as much as you're going to expect to make here in an area that is not growing inflation we're not we're not inflating the prices were not making more money here but we are losing people\nNow when you start to gain more people and more people move back into your area then the funds can go up and the district can grow and people will naturally get more money\nBut why would that be such a hard concept because the concept we've always used before what was the concept we would simply say all you have to do\nIt's all about the details and you know that that that that's what I preach the guys and that's what gets echo throughout the team it's all about the details so so hopefully we carry that out tomorrow\nAll right you have a great day thank you very much thank you appreciate you\nAll right man that's Tim Marlowe and the wide receiver coach for Youngstown State we have the game and one tomorrow afternoon with the pre game was run protest and then at two o'clock we have the game

I'll be back next week and I got a lot of friends wanted that half the week was picked friends up at the airport that when you're\nYoung you're go there and watch me well I'm Glad we could live vicariously through your adult childhood yeah it's my childhood absolutely they are you guys have a great day\nThank you uh are itinerant reporter from the keys\nSomebody asked me to check this out yesterday and I did they actually did something you asked me to do\nAnd the other question was who's footing the bill when Donald Trump goes to the rallies well here's here's how it goes no according to the congressional research report if the president travels to endorse or congressional candidate either the campaign or a political action committee they have to reimburse the government\nFor some of the expenses yeah you know the food the lodging that the president would have paid on a commercial ticket so what's that add up to five hundred bucks\nThat doesn't include the costs of manning and flying air force one now here's wife oh here's here's the catch you on that you know you've got air force one\nAnd I forget how many thousands of dollars it costs to operate and then you've got the marine corps helicopter and the planes in the coast guard the secret service who else do you have you got\nYou pay for that you know why we have to pay for the president safety [noise] that's it\nSo yup you're getting so close in fact according to the G A oh that is the government accounting office for those of you who are not where\nUm the cost for President Obama's trip a four day trip in twenty Thirteen for days now\nIt costs three point six million dollars how many is Trump ticket\nSo you're going out there for four days three point six million dollars\nWe must be bleeding muddy folks travel includes both official and political functions as the White House uses a formula to determine how much affair is to be paid by the traveler and how many and you can figure folks that they probably are doing this the best of their ability to make sure that the\n... the Republican National committee is not paying for much of it or the Democratic National Committee is not either\nSo they're both guilty of it drop is no better\nMaybe worse but the congressional Research Service explained researchers how the system works when traveling balls world official one political functions the White House uses a formula to determine how much airfare is to be paid by the traveler\nAnd how any per diem law to shore to the answer here folks you're paying when the trip the president goes to what looks like a campaign rally however they cover their bases because they say we're going to do a formula and we're going to say\nWell if you had gone commercial this is what it was going to do so they reimburse that\nYou know what I'm with you folks say the hell in Washington\nYou know I don't care if you're a Trump or if you're a bottom up if you're going out and you're going to travel all over the world yeah nice to see it\nNice to be able to see the president but what is that costing a company that a country that is bleeding red ink on a daily basis\nDon't know [noise] it just makes you want to say I get paid on friday a\nI'll be right back stand rivers [noise]\nTime is ten o'clock Sean Baird brothers can be deterring fine heart\nBreaking five seven\nI'm hearing tend to more packages much like the ones packed with suspected explosives already found have been discovered today he tales from ABC's ...\nEight than I Am fine we just are leaving a ... a ... on the ana county and\nInstead of big a big rally at a good a good time there's oh it's\nVery good and uh you're heading up toward the Cleveland area no soul and is that where you're heading next yes\nThey're showing now this is a a two day bus around the state of course you know friend I've been traveling pretty much nonstop or walk around the state we have on the bus all the only Republican [noise]\nVery nice meal I'm Glad to gather\nSo\nWhy appreciate your calling me what's going on with your friend John Case like John Case it last night basically I thought was talking about um we're giving people a pass to come into the country here as far as the sub these migrants down here\nWell I didn't hear that no is that is that right\nWell I mean John basically saying that you know we're in a way to reach out to these people that are coming into our country and need to help them in here that the lord would want us to do this and do a lot of people have been coming out commenting on it today but you don't you don't feel that way do you I mean I don't\nKnow no no we can't look this is we're a nation of laws or we have to respect laws we got a lot of people who are waiting wind a man you know the right way are we respect the process\nUm and so you know the idea that you know what is going to open our borders it makes absolutely no sense is gonna it's gonna be a disaster if you\nShould know I I'd say that John John I Would probably say that his words you're being misinterpreted but what people are hearing\nIs that he is saying that we have to show compassion to these people which I agree with it I Know you do too but uh it comes back to this we have to take care of the public here in the ... in the United states before we can\nBring more people in and especially on the lower echelon Michael these people were coming with almost nothing and with a mature country you need to bring something to a mature country don't you\nYeah you need to bring some skills uh in in ... in Denver we're a nation of immigrants everybody who's listening a your show today you know somebody came here one of their ancestors gave here\nUm\nPresident President Trump is ... ... you know we just can't have open borders um you know the specter of\nYou know this thousands and thousands or who are making their way through to Mexico yes we have to have some clashes gas or you know we have to have that ... but we sent over ... and ... and ... and then we've got to follow\nThe laws and the laws are very very very important we're a nation of laws as well\n[noise] well you know what you and I have talked um\nA lot about issue one and I have a head judges on since then at least one judge a drug and I plan to have another judge on here soon\nBut it's pretty much the way you had said earlier that you could possess a great deal of drugs and do a great deal of damage if this issue passes [laughter] you know what Mike what I'm worried about the damage that this will do to the constitution of the United states I mean of the Ohio you are a lawyer\nWhat kind of problems is this going to present if in fact this would happen to pass a constitutional amendment from a lawyer and you're like what what do you do what how do you interpret that on day one\nWell here's your um I've often thought about this thing pass on to say what a match or if it enshrined in the constitution some rights for criminals really uh it it says for example that\nI'm any prisoner or with the exception of rapists and murderers and a couple of others but virtually every prisoner today in Ohio and we have about fifty thousand of them they could earn up to one fourth of the prison sentence off by quote participate ate whatever that means is in a program in prison\nAnd and so here here's a scenario that I can see based on my experiences attorneys general have a preschooler wakes up one morning and there's no there's no a program to participate in well he filed\nA lawsuit against the prison against the war and and you know we're going to be in court all the time and with a Geisha a face on that's the other problem is that we weren't Dan that the drug dealers\nMove very very quickly I mean I think how fast they change really from her one to mix with a fountain all I ... and we've seen a ball drugs the ball well put something\nIn trying it in the constitution we can't move fast enough we can't change fast enough or legislation and the marriage thing they're most addict sample was\nA you know I think talked about this time frame I we're ... we're on the show in that someone's going to have under this constitutional members supported by Richard Cordray someone can have\nUp to enough fat and all the kill ten thousand people on the procession he found with it on the police officer pulled him over the sheriff staff the highway patrolman whoever it was could not arrest them\nThey could not be given any jail time at all\nAnd so ... for a place like the honing valley that is as close to the border or or Cincinnati that's close to the order or or ... or what's going to happen as Ohio where literally a sanctions or stay for drug dealers sanctuary state for drug you\nSo they can come in and operate out of here so if you if you're a drug dealer in western Pennsylvania well you're going to be crazy you know not not to move to the ... valley where you can operate and there's no there's no penalty if they're found in possession of large quantity of drugs you\nKnow it worries me though too when you do what you had said earlier\nWhen on day one you now have to interpret what is law in the state of Ohio by cutting constitutionally\nAnd you have to put together an entire wing of people or a cadre of people that interprets that and tries to follow it to the letter of the law now as an attorney are you able to challenge that and change that without a vote\nNo if this passes\nAnd goes in to the constitution the only way to change the constitution you can't do it by statute governor can't do it\nAnd try and and the constitution into the voters again change it\nSo we wouldn't have to go back on about to have it repealed and of course that would that would take some time in the meantime Ohio State for a no ... no large amounts of fat and all\nWould not be punishable ... and would not be punishable by any jail time at all so it it's just a it's just a total disaster and you know Dan ...\nDemocrat and Republican judges of come out against us it's not a purse issue\nI just can't understand why Richard Cordray insist on the floor and we've had three debates issues come up and several of those debates and he's hung in there and said oh no I'm I'm for state issue one and you know even the Democratic nominee for attorney general\nIs against state issue one show it's a it's just strange it's strange things and we'll\nJust want to add one more point one of the things that we're seeing that works very well and Ohio which drug courts are with drug courts in the hunting valley basically where we have judges and their staffs you're taking a lot of time and allowing someone\nWho who is an addict but not a drug or an addict\nAnd they're found with possession of the small amount of that's allowed them to go into treatment and they work with and make sure that\nThe in the biology whatever they have to make sure that Wayne\nBut what we found is a lot of people make a and and so what will happen with the drug courts is they will go pretty much go away if there's no there's no doubt it because there's nothing to hold over someone's head so California passed similar to this and they they had their drug courts go down ... percent so just the opposite [laughter]\nIf you access on the opposite of what people\nWill judge jury and told me on Monday Mike He says basically but um my drug courts would be rendered do you know a non non existent because you're real reason for you to come there\nBut my ... and we'll give you a chance and I know you're you're busy today to\nComment on this and something that Richard Cordray and I've asked Richard I said do are you supporting issue one uh and you wish you wouldn't have and he's a given a chance to get out of that as you have\nBut he's still sticking with it but I Want to say one more thing that Richard is saying he's saying that we need to restore the local government funds where does the Mike DeWine governance see a stand on that\nYeah I I think we need to certainly work on that uh our local governments this is where we deliver\nCandidates they order but can you hear me now how 'bout now Dan yeah go ahead yeah I yeah go ahead what what what's\nYour response and I'm Sorry but what John Houston I said is we're going to really help children's services we're going to dramatically increase the money is coming at them on a valley\nOr to take care of kids because that's a huge huge problem that we're going to help the sheriffs in the prosecutor's ordering increase funds in that area by creating more ...\nTask force the state will pay for ordering help schools are directly but making sure that every school has a somebody in the school or who who's an expert in mental health so all of

I actually only got to share one question one answer when I got in my truck to uh to me with the way it off and I'm\n... ... you're absolutely right if you if you have a surplus at the state level well don't blow smoke up my fanny tell me you're going to send it back to my local government\nQuit taking it in the first place because I might be more apt to vote for my police levy my fire loving my ... my school levy if\nIf if we didn't have all this money going off to Columbus what what are you doing some kind of big favor to me by\nBringing it to Columbus raking off a little bit off the top and then sending it back following\nIt wait wait wait wait is not necessary Columbus but bill is not necessarily to Columbus his money it's all of our money writing but it's it's been a it's either trust\nWell of course but that doesn't need to go there yeah it ... if if they have less than ... at the end of the year or whatever the fiscal year is at the end of the year their balance sheets should say zero zero not surplus if its surplus they took too much in the first place\nWell wait and let me come back to you again though um do you believe in this a bank account that the fact that the state government has maybe you don't\nKnow I don't know if if they have to if they have money to put in the bank account that means they took dollar too much yeah\nBut that wait a minute you don't want a state that has got one foot and a banana peel the case there is a tragedy do you want some surplus\nWell okay maybe a little okay so but but hey if if if there is a tragedy then then they're able to raise that money when there's tragedy is this the federal government's all always steps in half the time it fixes that stuff anyway but\nI think general in general and that's what we're talking about they've got too much of our money sitting down there and if they hadn't taken it in the first place they don't need to funnel back\nWell how about the loss of you know I mean you come back here and you say okay\nThey're taking our money and we could keep the money here and we could run our own local governments exactly and that that that would probably be the more efficient way to do this this actually makes us become more efficient but in many ways it's a it's unfair to places they give you a very good example building where you live where what area do you live in\nI I I live in Poland so I'm looking at the Lebanese coming out of my eyeballs and\nSo what do you think about ... let me go back and you heard me say that the other day or just a few minutes ago what how they should do it and basically I said you know what if the teachers want to raise the nation ... lay off enough people to be able to give them a raise because they're not a growing district\nYeah there there needs to be absolutely definitely better management at the local level my understanding and I'm and I'm and I'm ... I'm new to Poland so I don't know the ins and outs of Poland and who's who and all this but my understanding is\nThat the school board gave the superintendent a ten thousand dollar raise at the same time we're the laying off teachers okay so it's only ten thousand bucks how many teachers you're going to have ten thousand bucks\nBut the point is mismanagement it's just blatant\nYeah we had a soul\nThat are two schools are over a hundred years old we need we need it you can't if you're mismanaging ten thousand bucks that's just what we see on the surface for crying out loud what else are they wasting\nWill just give you a ... give me so feed me back to comment on what I said I said basically\nDana I you know what that's the last three main last mainstream media is blaming the white guy for the bombing again just like they did that Kavanaugh thing without any evidence corner there was any gun powder and those things anyway but ah\nBut you know what I don't want to blame Democrats necessarily because that's doing that's doing getting low like they are but this kind of reminds me except for it and I'm not blowing up that\nAh you remember that movie with Ben Affleck where he says or that one guy said don't fight or shouldn't matter if you get to Americans and I don't mind these are\nOn the right and that's what they're doing now we're fighting and they were fighting pretty hard against each other\nBig time so you know an outside actor on this but I kinda go I'm Sorry to say it I Am doing that I kind of go what these fake bombs going to these crap\nPoliticians that are so arrogance and they vent arrogant I I I like the fact that\nThey're shaking or that they could be put in place and then that come down to the real world and then joined the\nHere's where you're wrong though I mean you've got to condemn the bombs at alternative and drop Donald Trump did the very beginning we don't want to society around here where you're worrying about opening up packages\nI don't know it was rice and and now it's bombs we had the Unabomber and those scares we've got to condemn this at at every turn but I thank you for your effort um you know I don't care what side of the coin you're on you don't want to live in a society like that\nOr you don't want people shaking other boots what\nYou want is a great bus system like we have here and I'm going to follow up and get the new CEO on as soon as possible but can I just talk a little bit about the benefits of having a great bus system you know buster clean they're safe they're staffed with courteous drivers\nBears his little sixty cents for your seniors thirty one day multiply passes are available\nAnd they have a new feature out there where you can download the W.

young south [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm hearing pressed in more suspicious packages are now in the hands of investigators\nAbsolutely um you know it's a multi dimensional challenge that we face and\nCertainly making sure that we deal with it for the the public health crisis that it is as part of it right so making sure that we are putting money into treatment and rehabilitation and appropriately as well as locking up those who are are criminals and I'm part of the criminal element of of\nUh of making this happen we need to frankly declared a state of emergency about this we are second in the nation's opioid overdose deaths\nAnd uh and and you know we the oftentimes when storms come through right people get a declaration of of\nA state of emergency well this is our emergency and if you have a state of emergency then an additional resources\nOr become available to help fight it but there's a multi pronged approach we have to have we need more treatment as they say we need to have an educational component to that that starts very early about keeping people away from it because once you are on it um as I understand it sort of as a as a person who's read and learned as much as I can\nUh along the way that it's very very difficult to to break 'em we need our our uh pharmaceutical companies to be reined in they contributed to that they have to pay the price for helping us clean it up um we have social\nGet are starting to get started just for a minute here not just let me turn swimming out here and this is what I said back and I I think I feel this way too\nIs that this has become a problem of people who do the right thing you know most of my audience they're not they're not engaged in this is this really my problem and and why is it what why do I have to pay for it\nWell look we're all paying for it so um if the question is are we going to have a thoughtful planned that actually addresses the root causes of this\nAnd try to clean it up in a way that effective or are we just going to say no we're against issue why\nBecause my could wind could have led it could have led the legislature if I was the attorney general I Would have tried to move legislation so that we could continue to perfect it right it would have been better at the legislative Lucia so the answer to your to the question is yeah it is our problem\nBecause it is it is costing not only lost lives and potential it costs us a lot financially right\nSo if if if people are not able to maintain the the constructive productive nuts and and their own life that has ripple effects that we all pay for so we all have to have a we all have a stake and and not to mention the loss of of of of of human uh humanity and all of\nThis right I don't have we heard was amended caught up with a male or are we going to address we've\nLost a lot of productive workers and I can I just which made it because I heard a number of companies that have ah\nThey're appealing to a radio station to help them find employees do you do you think that part of the solution is modifying the marijuana laws but we could have people that could actually work and not be drug tested as much for marijuana in that we would have a bigger workforce\nYeah I don't know if that's the answer I think that that there are definitely issues and challenges for workforce and certainly um the opioid addiction problems that Ohioans are are suffering um it's part of that\nBut we need to invest in power and workforce um and one of the things that rich and I are really focused on is closing that skills gap you know\nA for a long time in Ohio the the old song from those who've been in charge is you have to go to college you have to go to college you have to go to college and there are a lot of folks who frankly have had great success going to college we need to make it more affordable and so people aren't burdened with so much debt but college isn't for everybody\nBut a good life it and so rich and I are focused on a skills based training you know more apprenticeship programs for a vocational education making sure that those employers\nWill have the workforce that they need to succeed not only in the present\nAlso in the future and frankly people will have the opportunity a pathway to the middle class and we really need to ...\nMore quiet half you know let me ask you something else or you know about the jobs you know I grew up my family's in construction and ... and I could have gone that way but I went into broadcasting eventually my brother's still limited but\nAre you in your travels have you known people I Know we can talk about people going into a factory worker going into a construction work but it was a really a desire for people to do this a lot of people look at people that have worked in this and they say they're all broken no I don't want to do that are we going to be able to find a workforce here in Ohio\nAbsolutely we're going to build a workforce here in Ohio we just need to open up the\nUh the the pathways of opportunity for folks and a lot of people don't know about the possibilities you know I'm the daughter or their maker and a and my daddy started as a sleeper worked his way into the union and and the advanced and and so ... that was the pathway youngest is six hit\nRight like it it it's a provided a life for us that you know maybe we didn't have everything but we didn't we didn't have everything and and it was um and it was a a good a good foundation um\nWe need to stop stigmatizing\nA certain kinds of professions their dignity at work um and whether ... whether you're an end the trait that hard and important work I'm a\nCareer tech may be different it might not be all the same kinds of skills training that we offer we need to be a more broad base look at those areas where they're going to be actual job opportunities and growth\nIn the future target our resources and our investments there to empower our people at the skills and the training they need and yes we can do this but it starts with leadership saying is that skills training matters and uh it can't just be the same old way where we looked down on people who choose a path other then call it\nLet me go back to you know the thing you have to forgive me if I'm not asking all the specific questions here that I ask you again as I Would have got to get your opinion here on schools here because we have gone to a ... year of school funding and people constantly feedback you know we have\nThis plan here where you cannot fund schools based solely or as reliable as much on a property taxes your thoughts on that to correct that inequity in the eyes of most of my audience\nYeah you know this has been a long time problem and honestly we need to make sure that every child gets the education they need to empower them to those good jobs not good life that they deserve so\nUp first we need to expand wrap around social and health services in our local communities again making our schools the center of our our uh our neighborhoods in our communities giving a full range of physical and mental health resources those\nThose things that we had when we were little but we don't have a today and we need to trust our educators what has happened there are in the valley with the takeover rich and I don't think that was the right solution we believe that we should be working with local leaders\nAh that one size doesn't fit all and people running it from Columbus is really the way to go uh we need to leave more time for learning a giving our educators are and are schools that says as the public schools is supporting funding that they need\n... you know do not many I mean we did try that here for a long time and the young some schools are not working that way so we'd go be brought in\nThe legislator legislation in John Cage that came in and put in a CEO that hasn't worked out too well either I don't know what ... what can I go by you just ask you again we are the wrong decision you know we're we're not rely on the property taxes are quite answered that what's your thought on that okay are you going like\nYeah I have a great answer for that because I was actually on the state legislature will drop was decided and I was a ... on the makers brace I'm fighting for that decision so I fully believe in the uh the decision on Iraq of course they taste that they are the Supreme Court so that that decision never really had to be fully implemented\nBut written I don't need a court decision to tell us that we need to stop the reliance on local property tax the idea that Columbus should just take all the money there and then send the burdens back to the local a local level so taxpayers have to make it up\nAn extra property tax levies\nOr to find our schools our our our emergency services or infrastructure is wrong we are going to reverse those kinds of cuts to local governments were going to\nUh make sure that the funding for our schools you know it's an old trick it's an old trick they say oh they government's doing great uh and they keep all the money's there and they send all the responsibility for services back to the local level whether it's education\nNowhere near ... wait a minute I think I think you might be rushing to some people do did you say that you enrich we're going to go back to address the ... decision and we're going to drop a reliance on on property taxes\nWhat we're going to do is we are going to find a way to fully fund uh\nUh uh the the needs of of people and the so we're going to visit the way that those priorities are being a a an accomplished and if in the schools and making sure that they have adequate resources is a priority then we should find a way to do that for\nYou but you're not really you're miserable or you or you\nKnow the cell phones there's going to talk to each other sometimes but I'm going back in getting this reliance off property taxes can you tell us that something that you and rich Cordray will pursue\nLook we have to we have to provide the funding that it's necessary for schools to do the important work there is no substitute for the education of our kids is the cornerstone not only of democracy is the cornerstone of a good life\nAnd we are going to finally fix the school funding formula as we were we were told to do and the ... decision and we don't need the ... decision to help us do that\nYou're going to do that even without it or a leadership\nOr does I've done with a lot of the other candidates I'm going to give me admitted on a
