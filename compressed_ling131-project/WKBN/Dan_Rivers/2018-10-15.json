today\nAnd I'm looking forward to having you out there about some great deals and we're going to have those for you all morning here on five Seventy WKBD in well the stakes are rising up to the parents of the Saudi journalist ...\nPresident Trump promised severe punishment if Saudi Arabia was involved but it's not all that simple is it a bill ... we have the Saudis who uh or spending a lot of money here the United states what the heck is going to happen with this one\nYeah this is a very difficult one for the state department and for the president to handle Dan or for that very reason at once the president said that there would be severe punishment if the Saudis were involved they shot right back and said hey if the United states to impose sanctions or other political pressure they would respond with even greater action of course\nThey just completed a big arms perk is from the United states the president has already said he rate to lose that\nAnd uh the Saudis of course control that oil tap with OPEC they're the largest producer at OPEC end up a lot of influence over the other OPEC countries as well and just on the speculation\nThat there could be some type of ripple in the relationship between the United states in Saudi Arabia oil prices are already going up to and so if there is indeed some type of dispute between the U.S and the Saudis or we can expect a oil and gas prices to really take a jump now\nAs for where this investigation is\nAh we may learn more today a there's been an agreement that a team of a Turkish investigators and Saudi or investigators a joint team will be searching the consulate today\nOr to try to find some evidence of what happened to ... uh and all we know at this point is that there was video of him going into the consulate\nBut no video of him coming out of the consulate and of course everyone is fearing the worst that he was killed a inside that consulate so this is a very typical one not only as far as the investigation goes but as far as the global implications and the applications for the United states and in our relationship with Saudi Arabia\n... we're talking with bills him for a year and the disappearance of Saudi journalist ... ... I Believe he's dual citizenship American in Saudi and he's also a writing mostly for the Washington Post\nUm that makes it difficult would this is the same as any other American cities citizen that would have disappeared in another country right\nA member of the word September and that's the mark of a west coast team you get better as your goes on unfortunately that's not happening right now when we aren't making strides we aren't eliminating them stakes\nWould give up way too many big plays on Saturday you know they were able to run the football South Dakota state but it was a big place near the end of the half they made a big round quieter quarterback had to lock touchdown runs those things aren't being eliminated and I think that's probably the most disappointing that we're not getting better\n[noise] [noise] yeah and they lost their quarterback or early in the game did they\nLost their running back ... they ... they lost a really good running back and uh and he was out but they brought in a freshman and that's true freshmen CJ Wilson for South Dakota state ended up rushing for about a hundred yards um\nThis is an excuse stands at our our town and our league so much better than everybody else that has the U.S football ...

remind you folks as we do every week I'm most weeks when you're ready to live your dream you don't want to be on hold while you stress over selling a whole\nMike in March they had been traveling back and forth to Florida for years I told you the story before but they were ready to head south for good and to be with their family not wanting to stress over selling their north Lima hold their own\nThey wanted to get the most money is most people wouldn't you get a good market right now so they heard about Kelly Warren in our program and they had seen what Kelly and her team's marketing did for other properties in the south range school district and they wanted the same\nNow in just a few weeks they had to offers on the whole they sold it for over two hundred and sixty thousand dollars nor stressor travel because Kelly got it done\nAnd now they make most of their summers in town and now moving to Florida fulltime and I'm really enjoying themselves and they did this because they were able to turn that whole around get the right price worth two hundred and sixty thousand dollars\nAnd all they did this go to Kelly sold it does come all the stories are there and then you can go on to look at the results that they have gotten\nLast year they sold two hundred and sixty seven ... this year they're going to be on pace to sell more than three hundred coal to Kelly team that's all you

president and first lady I Believe the White House soon heading to Florida the destruction\nIt's working fine it just takes time when you see devastation like this so they have to reset citizens expectations what they're trying to do they have\nFEMA's set up is already a twenty three distribution points where residents to get food water and other central but it seems that the problem here right now Dan is this those may be set up and you may be sending out a Salvation Army with mobile food units and it may be in existence but the problem is\nThese people who were hit by hurricane Michael still don't have electricity they had at best it any spotty cell phone service so they don't have any way of getting the information as to where these points are where they might be able to get food and water they have absolutely no idea and they may have vehicles that were washed away\nDuring the storm that they can get to things that are a couple of miles away so it's kind of a question now as to whether or not FEMA has really actually plan for worst case scenario and how they would get that information out if there was no electricity and if there were no cell service\nSo Michael when we talk about Mexico beach Mexico beach is a a town of about a thousand people people stayed behind in early on we had heard that well maybe we had been ... most of the\nPanama City had been spared a direct hit so did we I guess really just take it upon the of Mexico beach\nAnd the rest of the Panama City in Florida is much better off for use this pretty much replicated everywhere in Florida\nThere are parts of Panama City Panama City didn't take a direct hit in the city itself it kind of landed a little bit Michael landed mainland a little bit east so that the hardest part in the western front of the rain bands and the wind kind of came in just over the east to Panama City that's where you've got you know Mexican\nAnd some other towns there and that that all ended up with a huge amount of decimation at this point I'm Still difficult for rescuers together using file a fire officials and local rescue workers saying the hardest part is gaining access to some of these neighborhoods some of these cities\nSome of these town it it really has become there's a town called ... which is fairly close by Mexico beach\nAnd that town it's been impossible to get you that's why you've seen governor Rick Scott over the past twenty four hours saying that they are going to begin air lifting an air dropping food and water into those hardest hit areas because they don't have the ability to get in there with rescue workers yet and with those we don't even know what the body counts are what the the the people who have made it in\nThe writing the storm out what those numbers are we don't even necessarily know what the populations of the cities are right now but rescue workers cannot get to them so they're going to a air drops some food and water for them until they can get out that location\nSo President Trump and his wife they're flying in today to survey this but what is it we have like thousands of people that are still without power right\nOh absolutely yeah there's still a meant about people in that whole area uh the impact that initially you're looking at tangled downed power lines you're seeing the power poles those lines and ... on a either broken in half\nA broken a Ninety degree angle that you have all sorts of issues that you have to deal with there and they have absolutely at this point no way to get that POWER UP and running and with that power and lack there of you've also got a lack of cell towers that are functioning and you also can't get a cross pollination going where you got say an ATM the phone\nAnd the only service out there might be of arise and it seems to be working at a time you can't get a cross pollination to get both of those companies to work together just to get some cell phone service so as we've seen over the past couple of days it really has been reporters going into that area\nTelling the stories of these individuals or perhaps even being able to be lucky enough to bring a satellite phone with them to call loved ones and relatives until they can get these services backup which at this point looks\nLike you know taking longer and longer we're talking about weeks ... days to get that service back\nAll right Mike thank you for telling the stories and we appreciate it will talk to you later this week\nYou got to enjoy the rest of your week\nThank you very much and that's Michael power telling the story of

the white hall Ohio do you have a comment of what I said there\nYou know what I think that this has become\nSuch a small it affects so few anymore that this is actually getting ready\nTo make the turn the corner I think that that's what's happening we're getting ready to turn the corner on the heroin issue that we have had and I think you can see a little bit of it coming from northeast Ohio in what you basically have or the people that are kind of left over but\nIt seems that in places such as white whole Franklin County and these other places they are getting the brunt\nOf what is going on and they still have not been able\nTo get past this so if you have a comment we've kind of built in the program today and I think this is a local topic in that it does affect people but the percentage of people in the audience that actually are affected by the heroin\nEpidemic if you will or few\nThere are so many people that basically go on and say well like everything else this is going to have to run its course\nBut the people down in places such as white whole of Franklin Kelly and then the Hamilton County\nWhere they have had the brunt of this we have had it from time to time but nothing like they have had in those parts of the state but we're hoping anyway we'll take your phone calls on this what I basically said earlier I think we've gone too far now where we're going out\nThey have an approach in white hall Ohio where they're basically making the fire station a place where you can go\nAnd you can stabilize if in fact you or a drug addict they have test strips that they are now

do this but if you're going to do it you're going to do it anyway we want to save your life shouldn't they shouldn't be exactly the opposite shooting back or in saying\nIf you use is you could lose

been renovated\nAnd I think that this is fantastic because they've taken such good care of that that auditorium is a hundred years old and what you see my granddaughter play volleyball\nAnd a hundred years old and it is really a multiply um use type facility for basketball and mostly for volleyball but great time and a nice to be on the campus of the Carnegie Mellon university over the

five Seventy five you\nI'm hearing from them questions today from President Trump to the king of Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of that reporter at the Saudi constantly in a symbol\nWhere they have now decided to test the heroin to give you the chance of testing the heroin\nBefore you use it and then they're also encouraging micro dosing and this is being\nPropelled by the fire department there and they say that their entire thought is to save lives as sort of business they're in but I think most of you would say that we really are enabling drug use by the way the headline in today's news is that\nDrug use is getting better in northeast Ohio\nAnd it's like many have said it's one of those cyclical things much the same as crack cocaine when we thought will never be able to get out of that when we finally did find a way to get people to stop using crack in the number that they once were [noise]\nBut now heroine has become so deadly and we have other people that\nContinue to use it in our valley but not in the numbers they once had [noise] and then we got the other topic then I have here that I'm interested in is who's going to work here and I've never really found a logical answer for jobs that are going wanting\nWhat could be the reason the jobs are not being filled not only in the ... valley but really across the country\nAnd um I Wonder if we're going to get to the point where we basically say [noise] you know the only way to really get out of this is with real tough love so in other words if in fact you don't go to work\nYou really have no recourse but to live a subsistence living we just don't have money for you if you don't want to go to work and as you look around you would have to agree with me I think\nThat you could do something you could do something last week we had a little bit of extra ... plant that we're looking for [noise]\nFor people and then we have the even the things remembered up their warehouse up north Jackson they're looking for people and these are the kinds of jobs that most people can do if you are\nMotivated and able bodied and I you know we we look back here and we think about the unemployment rate in Youngstown it leads the state of Ohio\nBut is that a little bit our own fault\nAnd isn't that an oxymoron to think about this that you have people that are filing for unemployment collecting unemployment check and driving the unemployment rate up here in the Youngstown area\nAnd we have on the same but at the same token we have manufacturers construction companies warehouses\nOn and on and on all of these folks out here that have not going out and got these jobs has our valley for one that much\nAnd is it time to re populate our area is it time to actively recruit in other areas\nHave have you know I I think they'll probably a lot of employers would say\nWe have reached the limit on what we can spend the recruit\nValerie a few years ago people would've said my God if I could get a job in the steel industry I Will be golden and now I've developed a relationship with the people over Valerie and they're essentially starting people out that have the desire to learn\nAt forty thousand dollars a year\nYeah forty thousand dollars a year and you just bring your able body and your good mind and do this kind of work\nLess get out of the idea that this is easy work there's no easy work every job we're doing is we're doing right somebody said that and here we have\nThe gentleman that wants to bring in the auto park at jobs and we have Mr Joseph who wants to bring in a leading technology company that it's going to be able to chill\nSoda pop and water and beer or generally alcoholic beverages with a system that you no longer need refrigeration he's guilty two hundred and fifty people\nYou've got a thousand jobs coming up here in large town I don't know we don't get a lot of response on this topic but I tell you what I think it's a ... I think it's the topic we're talking about and\nWe continually have people that are leaving the area and going for other jobs and I talked to someone not too long ago said he my desires to get to Columbus you know there's a lot more vibe in that town while there may be but what does that say about young sound and furthermore or\nWe had talks about people that were leaving this town and they were going to Youngstown State university and then they were going somewhere else for employment\nAre we going to have manufacturing jobs even want to come here [noise] apparently the people in large stone TJ acts they must feel that they can attract the people that they will need to do these jobs\nOtherwise they wouldn't build here and what's the gentleman's name it auto park it I'm just went out of my mind but\nHe believes that he can have a footprint here and he's basically coming here to manufacture in war and he lives in Sherman Oaks California and saying you know what I'm going to ... and I've I've interviewed him and he says I'm coming here because I think that we can make these auto park it\nUm machines here we're going to need a lot of people that tend designed them we're going to need computer software engineers but we can do it here but will it be a struggle to do it here\n[noise] and then of course I have you know a fairly long history with both construction they were looking for people for years I don't know that they've ever found enough\nI'm kinda thinking that the the answer to this issue is going to be immigration\n\nI I just think that maybe we have reached full employment here in in in the United states to where we're going to have to take people that are willing to come and do these jobs\nAnd I mean recruiting around the world in changing our immigration laws and saying that if you want to succeed in the valley in these former areas like young somewhere we once had a very skilled workforce is no longer exists here\nBut if in fact we re populate this area with immigrants from the former Soviet Union\nFrom South America from Central America from Mexico\nWhat are we going to do with the people here that can't or won't work just ruined it have to be a two prong plan and\nSee what do you think what do you think in my in my own the money that we're not that we have we reached full employment what what do you think\n[laughter] I'm only how're you\nDoing All right yeah I think that we are a\nAt a full employment in a sense that people that actually wanna work are just about Philadelphia employed um I don't think we're full employment as in a sense\nThat we have there are a ton of people that can work but a lot but a vast majority of them don't want to or choose not to I'm I'm a member\nTo a lot of different Facebook groups in the area that by selling trade and I always see people looking for a job working for this looking for that or need a little help and I always ask very polite you know well you know [noise]\nWhat is stopping you from supporting yourself you know as as as you have a problem with the job and are you know you have a problem in climate\nAnd they'll say oh yeah I Can't I've applied everywhere can't find anything I was like oh great you know I've always you can pass the drug tests or can do a background has the background check and a\n...

Would love if in fact some ... some folks would call and maybe just say hey look I tried to get a job but here's what happened\nBecause very often we have people such as myself that are employed and we're sitting back and we're making assumptions on other people\nAnd you know I I really I hate that because most of us were able to tell other people what they should do what the people that actually have the answer they're not calling\nI don't know if they're not listening or I don't know if they don't care or they're not hear\nMe\nTake that into consideration too\nObviously the lyrics lyrics or

planned on the issue one that would make Ohio a safe haven for more drug\nDealers Britain or drugs to Ohio\nAll of those things impact our economy and if you want to recruit more businesses and more jobs we have to have the people to fill them and we have to get aggressive about our approach to doing it\nAll right John this very interesting you know take on this and someone just to text me and said that um our technical schools are only for the juniors and seniors I don't know if you can just for that or not but we have a joint vocational schools in trouble holding in Columbia counties\nWould there be any upside if in fact that's true to making this a freshman and sophomore junior and senior\nWell I mean I think there's an argument for that but but more importantly it's ... it's reaching those children and the adults that influence them when they're in junior high school to make them aware of the kinds of jobs that are available because too many times we have\nWe have a students who don't start thinking about\nThese kinds of issues until they're seniors in high school we need to get them thinking about this at an earlier age\nAnd getting them enrolled and these programs so yes I think making them available at at earlier ages is a is a good thing\nBut also hoping opening students Cindy as I said the adult family to influence them open their eyes to the opportunities that are out there getting a better connection between the employers\nA ... in the community and the educational opportunities in the community is a critical part of this it's something that is\nOn the top of what might the wind and I want to do in our roles as governor and lieutenant governor it's really creating a better bond between the private sector and the public sector education systems are at an earlier age so that people know what they need to do to to get ready for the jobs that are being created\nYou know my thought John ... you know I grew up in the construction industry and there's a lot of people that wouldn't want to do those jobs at any cost in fact there's a lot of apprentice programs that are going wanting right now in northeast Ohio tell me about the rest of the state\nPlaces like dating in Cincinnati and Columbus in Toledo are they having the exact same problem that we're having in filling jobs\n... well look this isn't a this is a problem across the country right now\nI it is you look last friday it was announced that we had the lowest unemployment rate this country and fifty years the economy in general is doing well and when and it's a strong labor market which is good for people because we see wages rising we see\nMore opportunities a abound but we also need to have the right kind of of education and training we also need to change our welfare system frankly to encourage work and not dependency on government uh\nOn on a government dependency which are welfare system sometimes incentivize is we need to you have a opportunities for people to have a\nA access to both jobs and job training in and day at a rational welfare system that encourages work and not the tendency to all of these things are are part of\nThis this plan\nBut look I Know I'm I'm I'm from the Dayton area uh spend a good portion of my life there\nYou know I'm going to be candid than a you know what Ted Strickland Richard Cordray run in the state eight years ago a and see our corporation laugh DHL left Wilmington ... shut down a lot of the jobs in southwest Ohio so date in Cincinnati that area was really hurting and now it's rebounded\nThe biggest problem or eight years ago is that that that that employers are laying people off because there wasn't enough work the biggest problem eight years later is that there are so many jobs they can't find enough people to fill them so if we want to be if we want to keep Ohio one of the growing economic\nEconomically prosperous states in the Midwest we have to get all over this issue of of education job training connecting private sector businesses with educators so that we're we're building the workforce the future of the the great part is is that when you do that everybody when businesses get the talented they need\nPeople get job skills which are more highly valued which means they earn more and they can they can live their version of the American dream by buying a house that car saving for their futures by if we get this right everybody wins\nAll right I'm just a couple of thoughts here I mean you know during the ... and you know we were seeking jobs and um I Would have thought that says we do have a Republican administration\nThat we would have been able to match the jobs with the talent that we could turn this around and now you and Mike DeWine say you're going to do this I guess the question is is I Would have in most of my listeners they'd say well gee why isn't this being done right now you guys were enjoying well\nWell ... frankly it's because we had to work on restoring the economy or the economy was in the tank we'd lost four hundred thousand jobs there wasn't a need for there wasn't the the need for job training or eight years ago\nWe took over because it was there were no job so people were losing their jobs and now by by cutting taxes create a better business environment we're we're out in front of the issue on a on job creation the jobs are just grow it at a faster pace than we can provide provide the talent and so\nYes there is an obligation okay for\nThe state to do a better job with this I think that we're moving in the right direction and one of the things that I have worked closely with those are are are ah robotics automation programs I've worked with the vocational schools on those kinds of things\nAre and trying to make sure that\nYou can you can move somebody for example you might have a ... a ... a job that's getting automated well how do we take the person who who may be losing their job due to that and get them\nOr the right kind of skills so that they work on the robotics a tech portion of that the new business a new factory facility we have created one of the best programs in the nation called ... and we're doing these kinds of things but if you need to step up the pace on it\nOkay uh we're talking with John Houston I'm dating area secretary of state currently a visiting the Ohio house and the Ohio Senate and now is Michael ... running mate for lieutenant governor you know John ...\nThe things that we talk about most often and I don't know that it's fair but we often talk about moving people from welfare to work or can you be a little more specific than you were rather than saying that well we need\nWelfare reform so see a little more specific on yeah\nGetting I'll give you specifically something that might wind and I actually propose ... right now um if you receive subsidized child care for example you're you're a single mom a you you're you're you're receiving childcare you'll you'll hear that's often\nThat a an employee won't take their may work twenty hours a week but they won't work forty hours a week because if they got a ... or if they got to raise\nThat they would be cut off from their access to childcare\nOkay uh and you know if you're making a twelve fifty an hour\nAnd you have to pay for it and it gives you a raise to Fifteen dollars an hour and you lose your childcare subsidy it's not really a rate it set you back what we what we proposes extending access to child care to higher wage earners so that\nWhen you do you can't go to work full time that you don't have to not take a job or not take a raise or not worked full time\nAnd be an ... have your children kicked out of the publicly subsidized child care system that's what
