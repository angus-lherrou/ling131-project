game was great that was fantastic and uh you know I I look around and I think we're going to have a beautiful beautiful day here today thirty five degrees is what we're looking at but let's kick it off with Bob handle is talked about hand a little bit here on by Seventy\nWKBD in and see what Bob is thought about the game we always do that are either written riskier bomb had an end to here is Mr Han and good morning Bob\nGood morning Dan how are you today the voice of the penguins on duty in his other job is uh making sure that the United way he's working on all cylinders how's that going first of all\nIt's gone well we're right in the middle of our campaign time and talking to companies about supporting our work and also all the work we do in the schools with with the kids are going so we're busy but no complaints here Dan\nAnybody reading more and I know I Know that's when your goals is to get a lot of third grade are just\nThey're ready to reading and I that's a big part of our after school program and the numbers are going up the I think than you know since you asked you know a lot of the kids we work with start so far behind so if you if you work with a second grader that's a kindergarten level\nAnd you can get them to start reading at a first grade level they're still behind but they're making progress but it it takes time but I I I definitely see progress than it just it just doesn't happen fast\nYeah yeah well it will pay dividends Bob keep at it that's all I can say\nWe will not known questions you know the the fruits of this work then take time I like to see quicker results but I think that's the big challenge some of the children are so far behind that if you can get a a grade level reading in the years a big deal but if there are two grades behind they're still not what they're supposed to be if that makes sense\n... you know I I get it and then and then you know you go through the um the grade school like that and you went to high school you're so encouraging\nYeah if you're not that I could tell you this what I've learned with the work we do we focus on mostly a K to six of these young children most of them the poverty or not reading by third grade unfortunately they aren't going to make it that that has to be the focus if they've got to be reading by that third grade level or they are so up against that they're not going to make it\nYeah well the one thing good about this country though too I mean uh you know if you don't make it doesn't mean the end of a life you go back and you can go back and you can re mediate and uh you can there's not as easy though not an easy but but it is available you know that people get their degrees other ways\nYeah and you know the other thing to dance you brought it up I Know we'll move on after this\nI think we're doing a better job in the valley talking to sixth seventh grade and even younger that I've been maybe colleges in for you but maybe you can get a job working at a daring or valor or\nA ... there's opportunities you know I hear from everybody in the valley that that I work with a manufacturing that there's a shortage a welder so you get a young person and maybe go that route\nI couldn't have a great living and do well but I don't think we talk about that enough but I Do think that there are some people like jazz ... hunting valley manufacturers coalition that's starting to talk about that so I think I Know when I was a school day if you weren't going to college guidance councilors didn't have a lot of time for you\nKnow no that's kind of what they were for they they never talk to me because I write you know I was in the trades and stuff like this we're\nTalking about that now a little more I think I Know down the road that will pay off course\nYeah very good well I'm isn't starting to pay off your Youngstown State the hard work and um you know we we really came out of the first half and played very well I was a very nervous and the second half though or what you see a tale of two two teams there to to have I guess\nIt was you know ... we jumped on him early which we haven't done it with them falling behind so I think getting that early leads sometimes leads the team that may be life not relaxed be a little more Canada than in South Dakota had a sense of urgency said it did make a run in the second half never felt like down the game was in control and I and I think when\nI look at it at ... ... talking all year let's run before all we have a great running back we ran the football Kevin ... had you know thirty some carries he had a hundred and sixty nine yards that's when we're at our best not one were throwing at forty forty five times the game and I think because we ran the football\nAnd we jumped on him early on that was the difference in the game and that's why we're able to get that lead\nYeah you know that's that's true I mean ... what opened up that running game or you just think that the giving Kevin ... more\nI think a commitment and I think sometimes when you run the ball you maybe get two yards are free are they okay it's thirty seven or sucking down and ate\n'em but I remember Jim trust that used to say you know we're going to run the bought a camera on Smith for three and a half hours and by two hours into it effects are going to go we had enough of this guy mhm you know I think you have to be committed that it may not always work but eventually we're going to break some place and I I just I think there was a commitment to run the football or work early\nAnd then when you can run it opens up ... in passing I just think that there are certain teams that maybe want to throw the football and that's their style I don't think here and ... that's what we want to do we want to run it you have to throw it I got it but when we can't run the ball\nIt's going to be very hard for us to win with a style play especially since we have a great running back\nMhm yeah how's it been gored or this and I was reading that he may have got banged up a little bit here\nThey get a head injury in the fourth quarter I'm I'll talk to coach cleaning tonight on the coaches show and find out more but I don't think it's serious\nI tell you what we did see though we did see a nice change of pace with Nathan may so and I hope we saved more that low in Florida they may as a really good runner problem with him if he's your quarterback all year and he runs without much\nYou're probably going to get hurt I mean unfortunately because you don't want your quarterback running that much but I I think ... gives us a little different luck and when he came in even though it was first Dr we didn't score we turned it over\nBecause the football for about six seven minutes earn some time off the clock but I think the answer your question I think that there will be fine I think ... Saturday against Indiana State another piece of that game then we we possess the football for forty minutes\nThat means for sixty seven percent of the game why she had the football you're going to want a lot of games when you carry keep the football for forty minutes and and that to me was because we were able to run the ball\nAnd or the mistakes were down this time weren't they although the the ... this is a very highly penalize team in my opinion what do you think\nIt is it's been a highly penalize team and it's something coach plane is working on a we had last penalties on Saturday ah and I got to keep getting that number down and the other piece you brought up as a good point that\nWe haven't been creating turnovers and we've been turning it over that is going to do me [laughter] I mean we had seven turnovers in the last three games mhm we don't create turnovers Saturday\nAt an interception returned it for a touchdown we got a phone call was scored a touchdown so if you can at least be even in turnovers and maybe had and we were ahead on Saturday\nAnd around the ball you're going to have a good chance to win a date and you talk to any coach and you say you look at once that at the end of the game look at colonel and that'll probably determine who wins the game and we've been minus\nIn that category but Saturday we weren't in and also not only getting turnovers but doing something with them they play the put the game away was DJ smiles interception they were driving yup you're round while we get the next thing you know it's a nice you only later that game's all\nYeah yeah that's how you're then they came right back in scored again today\nWe had ... yeah they they're too and they got married at twenty nine seventeenth yep but we've been waiting for that kind of game then and sort of feeling that maybe it was going to be Saturday Night you had a dome team playing in the rain and wind you know a cup conditions for them um but that's the kind of game we saw Saturday that I say we thought we'd see more of the season\nAnd you know they're still four games to be quite so we'll see if it continues\nIndiana State Saturday right there and they've they're they're playing tough to\nBuild and they were so bad last year they've been bad but I'm I'm curious to see them they have gotten so much better and they have a transfer quarterback who's playing really well but they've made great improvement they're playing really good football they're not the same old Indiana State uh if we can get this one Saturday all of a sudden we're three and two in the lake and\nNon before and for over all the the finishing stretches brutal North Dakota state northern Iowa Illinois state so we really got to get this one on Saturday against the second most new or

but let's talk about the other drugs state issue one would apply to Soviet cocaine or methamphetamine opioids\nHeroin date rape drugs and even you know or you can be caught with that and a state issue one passes you can only be charged with a misdemeanor\nAnd the judge would be prohibited from sending that person to jail for even one day a until the third conviction over twenty four months\nNow there is somebody that just came into the United states last night and they had five pounds of knowledge you can believe that judge and they had twenty five pounds of marijuana someone like that that would come to Ohio now that would put them in prison correct\nThat would put them in prison but the way the law is written right now if someone can possess up to ninth team point nine grams of fat and know enough to kill ten thousand people and under state issue one they could only be charged with a misdemeanor\nOkay and then they could go back and um go through the courts and they could go if they didn't if they stayed clean for six months and they did that even if they didn't have three occurrences of that in what twenty four months is that and they wouldn't go to jail either and if they if they hit the floor during that time they may go\nCorrect but only to jail or prison well\nSo what is the what's the obviously you're pretty upset about this because you got you guys went out and you did your your thing here you just think this is crazy law\nYet from some of the polling I'm seeing some people don't feel that way do they feel that this thing is something that we should vote for\nWell here's the concern then the advertising for state issue one is very misleading because they\nIndicate that there are too many low level non violent people in prison who suffer from an addiction and that if state issue one passes it's going to reduce the prison population and increase treatment\nThe reality is that last year alone there were only sixteen hundred people sent to prison in Ohio for a felony for or felony five offense not putting that in perspective\nPrisons population and Ohio is about fifty thousand so only sixteen hundred people went to prison last year and I can assure you most went on a probation violation or because of a prior criminal history so that the message is incredibly misleading\nRight so and and then of course I mean just the deal breaker for me as amending the constitution I mean that's that's just you know you go back and tweak this thing it's not that easy to do judge after you're\nWhat you're ... you're exactly right than um\nIf it were legislation and we recognize six months for a year from now that it needed fixed or that it was just bad law you could change that easily\nThrough the legislative process a way of an amendment if we realized a year from now than it has not made neighborhood safer that it has not provided the treatment that it promises\nIt would take another constitutional amendment to amend that or to repeal it\nOkay so the people that you see coming through your course right now you do other things besides drug court right\nYes I have my normal like all the other for general divisions your eyes I have my civil and criminal dock it and I just do drug court on the side because I see it's effectiveness\n... what do you think that this would do to the community of this issue one past year drug court\n... drug courts for all intents and purposes would be rendered at best ineffective at worst eliminated because again people\nCharged with possession could not be charged with felony so that entire population would be shifted to this one county courts there's one additional thing that the amendment does that no one is talking about especially the people pushing it\nA for somebody on felony probation let's say someone's convicted of\nBurglary and the judge wants to give that person a chance and orders that they get treatment orders that they make restitution if there's destitution\nPuts no contact order with the victim in that case\nIf this passes a person who had failed to report to their probation officer refused to go to treatment refused to make restitution and even violate a no contact order and the judge would not be permitted to put that person in prison\nSo they're bullet proof I mean because they have a drug or felt or a felony drug um charge because of this new state one they would not be able you wouldn't be able to go back and say you violated prison you're violating probation you're now going out here you're bothering this woman uh\nWhen you were told to stay away from her\nThen it doesn't even have to be a drug possession case it could be as serious as burglary or a robbery and if they're on probation yes they can thumbed their nose at probation they could from their nose at or a\n... and this is not just this is not just drugs then this is not oh my goodness\nAnd that's what's so misleading about the message in addition to that\nThe proclaimed money savings is going to be a result of individuals who've been sentenced to prison now if they participate in certain programming which is you'll find if you read the a state issue\nThey can get up to twenty five percent off of their sentence 'em by simply participating they don't even have to complete the program\nAmong but what I tell you you're getting my attention we're saying this doesn't even have to be drugs this could be somebody violating probation order or they could providing are invading a um a a court order to stay away from someone and you could not go back and re mediate that and change it\nYou're exactly right well well\nWhat so [noise] this ... this thing can't possibly pass I mean you'd think the good people everywhere now jak we can figure out that we do need to do something about if you're a first time offender in some kind of a a person that you don't need to send people to jail maybe for a a just using cocaine one time\nWe need to maybe change those kinds of things but haven't you already change if you have some latitude in that in your sentencing\n... you hit the nail on the head because one of the other things to proponents were talking about is the fact that Ohio has done nothing to address this population right in fact there's a Senate bill that passed two years ago fifty five counties now are not permitted to send the felony for or felony five first time offender to prison\nWe are are ready addressing that\nI'm In two thousand and nine\nOhio spent about sixteen million dollars for community programming in lieu of prison in twenty eight team that number jumped to Seventy three million\nThe other thing they're not talking about Ohio is recidivism rate is less than half of the national average and we have over one hundred felony drug courts in Ohio right now\nSo we've taken positive steps we can absolutely do more and we need to do more but not by way of a constitutional amendment and not by way of matters that we've just talked about in terms of violating family probation with a ... and it's the same time removing judicial discretion\nFrom helping to make our communities and neighborhoods safer\nSo so I I made a pretty good case for not passing this\nBut again for people just joining us we're talking with judge jak dark and we're talking about the issue one you're saying it not only applies to people that are using drugs but it could apply to people that are convicted of a burglary and they may not go to jail and you would in ... probation\nJudge just real quick summarize your best argument against issue want in a minute or two\nThen it would make all felony possession cases a misdemeanor of the first degree now what concerns me is that it's including date rape drugs in front of you know we just had that case with the forth police officers and Campbell with the trace amount of of powdery substance I assume it was ... you know\nHas been volatile lately did you stay put did you move your money out I'm Andy Smith co

leave those winds open until the top of the hour to talk about that topic\nA judge jak there can make an impassioned plea not to vote for issue one I'm going to circle back here just make sure that everybody understands this I I I Can't imagine you do\nBecause I think that this one's a lot more clear than the issue that we're talking about the last time\nAnd that was tying the drugs to monies that we'd be spent by the VA and by state employees that went down resoundingly they were going to do a constitutional amendment on that and you can do it fairly easily\n\nA little just but they're very but in any case uh you can you can change the constitution of the United states and the state of Ohio a lot easier if you have some money and in the state of Ohio oh you do see a three hundred fifty thousand signatures\nYou're collect those you pay people to go out and collect those signatures for about\nI don't they get ten bucks an hour or something like that and you'll see them standing out on the street corners or the or nearby a retailers or built stand out in the parking lot and milk attempt to get you to sign those and enough people did so there's where you are\n[noise] issue one on the ballot coming up we'll vote on this November six\nJust to be clear a yes vote supports a constitutional amendment so if you are voting yes on this this means that you want to amend the constitution\nJust the highlights as jak said it'll make offenses judge jak know no disrespect your judge ... says make both fences related to drug possession in use no more than misdemeanors and I think that that's set in the ... is important simply from this reason\nMay go fences related to drug possession so let's say that you are involved in a burglary but you're also draw you got drug possession judge ... just made the point you cannot be sent to jail for the burglary either\nThat that's pretty clear to make and I didn't read it that carefully until he had said that and then I looked it up and it says he is or what it says make offenses related to drug possession\nAnd you know more than misdemeanors so to me what's that's basically saying if you are breaking into a property\nAnd you have stolen some jewelry and you're doing this because you're going to go out and you buy the drugs and then you're caught with the drugs\nFrom that sentence there it sounds to me like you can't send that person to jail or prison maybe you can jail um for a little but you have similar to prison\nAnother point\nThis will prohibit courts from ordering persons on probation for felonies there'd be sent to prison again do you go back and you say that fast and sounds okay\nBut\nIf in fact you're on probation for a felony\nYou can't send them back to prison or send them to prison period for non criminal probation violations now what's a non criminal probation violation\nYou're not supposed to be able to possess a gun you're not supposed to drink alcohol or whatever it is you get that you can't send them back to jail for that\nIs also going to create a sentence that credits program for inmates participation in rehabilitative work or educational programs\nBut again you've got the hammer from drug court kind of taken out of it right hey come over here go to a drug court avoid jail no I can avoid jail without drug court\nIt was also require the state dispense savings due to a reduction of inmates resulting from issue one on drug treatment crime victim and rehabilitative programs\nSo judge jak dark and made the point he said no to and he said we only have we sent sixteen hundred people of a population of fifty thousand people in prison for drug cases last year\n[noise] so let's just say that that goes up then you're going to have to take that money that you saved and you're going to have to put that money\nInto drug treatment programs and I'm I'm not against drug treatment programs but do you really want to be forced to do this I I don't think so anyway have anything to say about this\nAnybody defendant\nJudge dark and said they're going to spend ten million dollars in media they just made a ten million dollar media by so you're going to hear a lot more about this and you know what you're probably going to be confused about it\nHe come in he's dressed in a blue jeans and his work shirt\nEventually changes into um a coat and tie\nHe greets people and goes back and just put on a fantastic show went out for about an hour and a half and just talk to and had people rolling in the in the aisles just laughing\nAll night so it was a great show I'm Glad to see that that happened uh we've also got a Dwight Yoakam he is going to be at Packard is coming up on Thursday and you've got Keith Urban coming in on Wednesday he got roped rock Tovia this weekend you guys you're ... you're supporting the arts and that's important and as I said last night when I was talking\nSaid you know what I'm you know this is northeast Ohio and uh we are getting it done\nWe're turning this area round\nGet a few roads paved get some blight knocked down and we're going to be doing well you know something else just a little bit of an editorial comment here\nWhen you think about and you know people you think about Youngstown State university and you know if you looked at that crowd the other day and you're going to go well cheese where are the people\nWell it's no different than any place else you know and people expect the excellence and right now Youngstown State football is not very popular\nWe have not won I think we see expected a lot more we went to the national championship in both second year but it hasn't really translated where we're doing it\nBut here's the thing about it I think that we are setting ourselves up for a day when the amazing facilities that we have including the ... center\nA Youngstown State university's football stadium\nThe track and field indoor volleyball the um outdoor track facilities those the softball and they and just everything that goes with that complex down there\nThey're setting that up for a day\nWhen that Youngstown State university football team is reckon with again and I can't wait for it because it's going to happen and we're going to get back to packing that stadium we just need to win nine or ten games every year but we'll get there will get there will be patient and um you know go ahead and be a home or it's OK yeah right now\nWe are three and four on the year\nAnd uh we need to improve but we will we will find more coming up [noise]\n\nIn real life is five Seventy W. J. D. and and now in science\nSo right to suit our friend Mike ... Mike how are ya [laughter] Hi Dan I'm doing real well how about you I Am well thank you very much a give us a good reason to buy some paint\nWhat the weather's turned your mouth and going here we've got the holidays come and maybe you just know houses are selling people are moving in just remodeling a lot of good reasons to paint I I think it's somebody should be done every day by everybody\nBut we carry the bench more brand and your price ranges are very competitive or between thirty five and sixty five a gallon\nFamous for they they they've led the way in that way and now we're counting on them to get this investigation done for us it was a lot of questions that have come up and about about this than I don't know necessarily gonna get answers to but I Do think there is a ton of pressure on President Trump right now in regards to all of\nThis well in and of course there's jobs at stake here and are not only that but does Saudi Arabia a you know it's like the devil you know they kind of keep the middle east a stable and they're a little bit more friendly toward Israel than they were so it is a fine line to walk but to listen to what Rand Paul says she apparently is\nNot exactly a a fan of the royals\nThis isn't the person and this is just another in the line of long instance last outing insult to the civilized world\nYou know I think everybody knows that but doesn't that get Mike I I I guess we shouldn't be surprised should we\nI don't I don't think we should and I think you're hearing that from a lot of senators now Bob Corker saying basically the same kind of thing and Ben Sasse Lindsey Graham ah they're all mimicking and and that's on the Republican side Democrats are also coming I mean this is one thing that's unifying both sides of the aisle at this point I'm ... and with all of that\nI think you're seeing the world had a response we've already seen that the u._k. France and Germany issued a joint statement\nAnd with that then you're looking at and German Chancellor uncle of Merkel saying that she will not allow arms exports to Saudi Arabia continue because of the circumstances and\nCanadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau threatening to cancel a multibillion dollar defense contract with the kingdom over the affair so they're kind of stepping up their game and saying President Trump are you in on this with us will you make a move similar to what we're doing because we don't think that this is something that should happen in today's world you know\nWhat kind of money is at stake here from the industrial military industrial complex are we talking billions ride Michael if in fact we cancelled yeah and that's\nThat's what the president a president in an article in the Washington Post over the weekend said that he thought that there have been a lot of deception lies in Saudi Arabia is explanation he said that he would love it if the crown prince was not responsible for the murder but he also said that he would uh do a possible sanctions but stopping very very short of halting an arms deal sanction on any level he\nReiterated this and he has said it multiple times he said\nAs such and such a sanction would hurt us more than it would hurt them so his concerned about those jobs in that revenue is where his big big pressure point is right now coming from the rest of the globe\nAnd ride my way thanks for the update you have some great day\nEnjoy the rest of your morning All right there is Michael ... in Oregon\nA push up more no but I think we need a new tell us that's what I hear yeah best would I vote for Newt tell us\nOr mine sticks in any case ah is October twenty second in the temperature is forty one degrees of news radio five Seventy WKBD in this migrant caravan Donald Trump says he has a solution to the immigration issue but he won't reveal it just yet listen to this\nI'll be honest with you I've already figured it out\nWe're going to make a lot of people happy [noise] we're going to make a lot of people [noise] they got to keep it a little bit low key until the election\nSo that probably means that there are troops go into the border here that caravan his nose swelled to seven thousand well there's other issues here to ah Marchman rose um interest was peak today we're talking about issue one and a mark I would imagine you're a no on issue one to argue\n[laughter] hey and find good morning than we are in our back or the or the GOP committee met two weeks ago and we voted to oppose issue one it is just a bad idea even if one were good idea it should not be in the Ohio constitution\nOr things like that should be handled to go through the regular legislative processes should go to the general assembly with that testimony with hearings\nWith witnesses and or in if it's in the ... and it's got to be changed where you can do that through ... through legislation but if it's part of the constitution it becomes nearly impossible to to correct it or fix it if it's not right\nSo so you would have to have people that we go back and really go back to that same process of changing it correct in that means getting approximately three to four hundred thousand signatures\nAbsolutely it's just a it's just crazy vote no on your show when it's a it's a bad idea and again even if it was a good idea don't put it into the constitution or if your doctor by the general assembly\nI mean we've been asleep at the switch here um legislatively you know when you think about if in fact you need to have things changed as far as putting people in jail\nWe should have been thinking about this the the Republicans and Democrats alike but mostly the Republican should have been thinking about changing this law and we should be getting more out of our legislators\nHoosier that's why we that's what we have elections that's why we have a state Senate that's why we have a house of representatives reelect folks to represent us in Columbus and a and a dog can pass good law when it makes sense but doing this through the constitutional process is a is just a just crazy\nSo what do you hear a mood you know they've got some polling out here in the last I had heard that it was leading a that was rather surprising to me but the what ... what do you know\n[laughter] we'll granted surprises me too but uh but I think I heard your comment earlier about the power of television the power of radio\nPower of advertising or if you can spend a lot of money and and uh and craft the craft ineffective message it can sway voters\nAre but that's why it's so important that people pay attention you've got to get involved you just can't learn how to watch TV and listen to the radio you need to do some homework and that and pay attention\nTo what goes on in my right mark that you basically can say almost anything you want it in an ad or it can be challenged but rarely is there any sanctions\nWere in the in the political arena that is certainly true the uh the first amendment gives gives great latitude to political speech and and for good reason but it ... it also reminds the citizens that they've got a responsibility to\nTo uh to look into the issues we're going to facts do some homework and that don't just take everything that you see on television or reading on the Internet at face\nValue what am I think sometimes usually\nYou know what it's like the story\nThinking about the products I mean the medical people have\nAnd put all these disclaimer is on and are rarely do they put a disclaimer is on the political ads in fact the candidates endorse them but we think more about aspirin but what else is going on mark\nWilliams the uh the the latest news is that Joe Biden coming down I'd like to remind the folks that Republicans also have a a geo ... star coming to town Jim Jordan\nOr who's ... who's a very popular Ohio congressman serves on the yeah the house Judiciary Committee and that we

recheck the stock market but we're up about a about a hundred mile an hour ago Andy I've been busy I haven't looked we're we know\nYou know right now is a strong open 'em and then we kinda came down just a little bit you look at the futures or down just a couple of points but it's not necessarily the excuse me the mayhem that everybody thought it was going to be\nMore we're talking with Andy Smith from financial engines always good to catch up with you my friend and do we have had some volatility since you and I last talked\nWe've had a tremendous amount and so we you know we were hitting new all time high after new all time high or there was a little bit of pull back a little bit of volatility things have kind of continued there into the weekend there was some\nConcern about what was going to happen with China and if that was going to materialize the way that everybody thought but it doesn't help that what the terms or you know kind of a handful of days away here and so there's just a tremendous amount of ... of a motion tremendous amount of volatility right now and people are just trying to figure out what the heck they need to be doing\nRight I mean are the financial still strong I mean or the middle of the data that you would read is that pointing to a solid market\nIt is and say what you have to do is\nYou've got all of these economic data releases that are coming out all of these international development and so you have to be able to figure out look are there still economic tail wins that are pushing us through the market and and we think that there are\nWe're not ... we're not thinking that the market's going to go up forever but it's not necessarily the doom and gloom the absolute cataclysm that a lot of people want you to think is coming out there\nIn any sort of market environment you want to prepare for volatility you want to only take the least amount of risk that you have to take on to reach your goals but no matter what's going on you have to have you know some growth\nFor you know kind of working for in the market but she got to be able to maintain your cash flow but that's that's no different than any other time that you and I would talk here throughout the year\n... yeah and you have to kind of adjust for the market but it's always comforting to know that the financial data that we are now reading that the you know just looks at the earnings reports and looking out six months the country is still on financial sound ground\nWe think so I mean you know September ... minutes showed that the fed expects\nYou know a little bit more of an increase of the federal funds rate at the conference board a leading indicators they're up in September and that suggests that the U.S business cycle really kind of you know remains on ... on a strong growth trajectory real estate was up\n... you know and so you have to be able to to kind of separate the emotion the politics promote we're actually seeing\nAnd let the market kind of run its course you don't necessarily want to wake up every day and and think that there is some trade that you have to put on the problem is people do that and they look at social media they look at the news and think oh my gosh I got a trade my IRA right now and that is probably the worst thing that you could be doing right now\nVery well but I Know when you come on you sometimes you offer some free things do you have anything that my audience will be interested in today\nWe do we know that there's volatility we know that people are trying to figure out what they need to be doing here through the rest of the year\nAnd it was a big reason why over the weekend we had a a free portfolio review but this one includes a a Social Security analysis so many of you are getting close to retirement so many of you are finally able to retire\nAnd Social Security is going to make up a huge portion of your cash flow as you move through your retirement years and so on investing cents over the weekend we had that free portfolio review or that that Social Security analysis\nAnd wanted to offer it to your listeners here today through ten o'clock or here this evening just get out to investing cents dot com like get started and we'll go from there\nVery well Anthony Anthony Andy has a show here every Saturday at eleven o'clock and today we have a free off or do you say this is still pin tonight and then it ends but if you just simply go to the website how do you get there\nInvesting sense dot com at the NFC\nSo investing sense dot com click get started will sit down with yeah we'll look at your current investments will look at your current financial plan or we'll get your squared away on some better a Social Security claiming strategies so that you can get the most out of the system as you can\nWe'll we'll basically personalize a financial plan for you are here to bring everything together so you know how to pay for health care or what you're going to do with Social Security what your ... going to look like a investments what do you need to be doing to get ready for the rest of the year but get out to investing sense dot com and like I said well get your squared away\nVery well investing sense and that's the only 'til ten o'clock tonight and he just one final question here is a Social Security pretty straightforward I mean when you're taking Social Security you take it at retirement age and uh then you can delay it and make eight percent a year up to Nineteen up to age Seventy\nUm isn't that pretty much straightforward what other issues are out there are there they'll do they\n... yeah the issue that we see is that people want to just claim Social Security as early as possible but if you claim benefits while you're still working and your younger than full retirement age Social Security is actually going to reduce your benefits for every certain amount of dollars that you earn above a limit\nSo you think that you're getting more from Social Security but

send me a document than after this review no obligation\nSome people actually turning back now and going back\nA toward Donald Honduras but many people are reluctant to take the the Mexican offer\nOf fearing that they will just basically be sent back to their home country or that they would rather just continue on now whether Mexico can convince them that they are earnest in their offer they have started putting buses along the route that this caravan is on saying that the people look any time\nGet on the bus will take you over to the processing center will start the process of granting you asylum\nBill why why this magnanimous offer from Mexico because um you know is is a poor third world country in many respects and are they are offering to take them in but a lot of people don't believe they're sincere is that just kind of your point\nThat's what they're saying and the caravan uh but uh they're under a lot of pressure from the United states as well and I think that uh you know the president has put a lot of pressure on Mexico to deal with this and uh and last time there was this caravan last spring which was not near the size of this one\nMexico did something similar granting them temporary visas to stay in Mexico to try to dissuade them from going all the way to the United states that's really what this was all about\nTrying to ah try to a halt them where they

K. being picture right to our page and that's just how things are getting easier and easier than we first went into this digital\nEra [noise] hey I'm before I go to phones uh let me just tell you a little bit about them something that I encountered here recently\nNo\nI had a Youngstown family know this this blew me away they said you know with the Obamacare that we have right now and God Bless anybody they can pay it a family of seven they're paying sixteen hundred dollars a month\nFor health care sixteen\nNow you have heard people talking about or we're going to lower health care where to do this\nBut how about that\nIf you had to come up with sixteen hundred dollars from you and thank God that you can do it right because you know the the alternative is you could lose everything you've ever catastrophic illness but I was just it was Florida are you not floored folks severe hearing this for the first time and you're saying really\nI'm a\nGod Bless the mother Clear Channel I heard your that uh they give us a chance to buy health care at a discounted rate it's nowhere near sixteen hundred dollars but I I just can't imagine people out here that are talking about this sixteen\nHundred dollars per month every month for health care\nAnd you know John ... friend of mine I seem a lot and we talk and you don't but when when I asked John Boccieri about health care I said Jon I said you know you're kind of the reason the truce healthcare because you actually voted for Obama Kerry said well why don't you like about it you don't like the early ... you can stay on until you're in college\nUm you can you could actually get healthcare with the pre existing conditions definitely all those are good things I guess what I'm Talking about this entire bill\nThat we spent the better part to three years during the Obama administration is now rendering healthcare too hard working Americans to the tune of six teen hundred dollars a month\nSixteen\nYeah I mean I don't know how to emphasize that I I don't know where you would actually go what if\nWhat if you had a family of seven well OK sliding scale your cost would go down this person obviously made good money\nBut that's what it's costing but that's that's a lot for almost anybody what I mean the the question that I I often have and as I just told you I said you know I recently had an injury and so you know I'm dealing with some doctors and the bills and stuff like that it's astounding how much they closed it really I don't know where we can go in this country\nTo start bringing the cost of healthcare down it's going to be a real issue\nSo I Want to get that off but just we have a comment on that but I'm Glad to take those of course and we have ten or Fifteen minutes to talk of this is another thing that I think is worthy talking about maybe you want to make a comment on this this is what the president is now saying about the caravan\nAnd uh I mean I don't put this on the list of big things that are plaguing Youngstown right now\nBut it is plaguing the United states and this is people targeting the United states and coming here because it's easy to get in\nIf that doesn't work out we're calling up the military not the guard was calling up the military and we're going to have the military said they're not coming into this country they might as well turned back and not coming into this country but in\nAny here's the other issue here you know whatever you may think about the president and there's many people that think that Donald Trump is just not a nice person that he is in with both feet and that he is just ... I went to the latest thing is is he has a vocabulary of a fifth grader\nBut think about this Donald Trump is the guy that proposed early on that we build a physical wall\nNow that's been forwarded and here's the president\nThe Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration will bankrupt our country bankrupt our country", "show_name": "Dan Rivers", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "22"}
