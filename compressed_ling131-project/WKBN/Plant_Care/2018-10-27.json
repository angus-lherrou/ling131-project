ordinary Sabbath worship service\n[noise] yeah I mean if you let the synagogues across the country and and the security at ... that have been put in place over the past several years there is a very as based on the resources of the institution of the congregation um\nThere are some federal resources that have been available on past years to help synagogues enhance physical security improves
