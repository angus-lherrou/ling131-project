[laughter] so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around that's I'm a crafts four years ago it was the Republicans\nWhen one more question before we leave you know one of the ... most interesting things that you wrote about the China us negotiation is something that I mean is is completely unique I haven't seen it anywhere else but it makes total sense\nYou said one of the biggest concerns is what happens from a social construct with China if they continue to push or if they pushing the wrong ways as ... as negotiations continue um you know especially as it relates to any sort of pressure\nThat China would bring to bear on foreign businesses doing business in China ... remind listeners what you were talking about because this is so important and when I share it with people you see the light bulb go on and it's just like of course I mean they do not want to risk is what is the social risk\nThat China faces that the U.S does not as we continue to move through these trade negotiations\nThe problem is ... a couple of different dimensions all working together against China one is that modern China or the China not subsistence farms in rural poverty but\nOf glittering cities are full of working class people it's never experienced a recession so it's ... we do not know how the Chinese population will react under\nAnything but full employment of the highest unemployment rate the giants experience the last twenty five years for point three percent in this country we consider for three percent a boom\nYou know they they call that things are going so well so what would happen if they got six percent or seven percent you\nKnow now you would ... and this is across the very very large population so he's percentage point ... represents many more millions of people that it does here [noise]\nUh if China is a police state where a you've got to you know disarmed sheep like public being monitored at every street corner by cameras artificial thicken recognition software [noise] so\nThe problem with all ... states is the problem of leverage is often actual originally or\nRather its its political leverage by which I mean in any prison in any police environment\nYou've got hundreds and hundreds of people\nAt one guard yeah that one guard has one\nGuy and that one has twelve cartridges and one of the chamber and that's it and so if something goes terribly terribly wrong\nUh you got what happened to the Soviet Union and that to any of that where a couple of people swarmed the Berlin Wall of for some reason the atmosphere was such that they made the decision about the machine gunned them and then the next twenty five people ran across the wall and then six weeks later\nThe evil empire of the Soviet Union had broken up into that you separate countries right six weeks later and nobody\nNot all the great the good the wives of Henry Kissinger is of the world's predicted anything like that and it just happened at six weeks and so\nWhat could happen in a nation of one point four billion people where you've got you know half of them on minimum wage living in cities have I'm Still a subsistence farms\nAre there enough right believes that is president Xi Jinping's nightmare that's where the pressure hits\nThat was

release of Andrew Brunson was a diplomatic triumph for Trump\nOkay um if you're only putting like just an inch around to get rid of it it's not going to hurt anything\nAt all but more than an inch at this point I Would not do it because it does suck nitrogen now most of your establish pet plants like trees and things like that it's not gonna hurt okay shrugged\nPlayers around a fruit tree\nFruit trees and that it's not going to matter one because it doesn't really their roots are established they go down twelve inches they go out forty feet\nOkay it's not going to matter on them shrubs um perennials things like that when you're putting in around those that can hurt a little bit this time of year though you're putting it down for the winter it probably won't matter much because\nThey'll be somewhat more decade when it comes in spring when it will matter for the plants so you put it down now you've fertilizers plants in the spring\nI'm the fertilizer will basically be sucked up to some degree by your sawdust rather than the plans so any fertilization you do in the spring especially if it's not decayed yet\nSo you can do one inch without any problem\nOkay so let's bring something high nitrogen that\nA little bit little bit higher you know you're still trying to get to bloom so like a a a balanced fertilizer and bring which is what I Would be doing around those plants yes\nHow can I think you know I'm not sure how the black All right thank you Bye bye and\nLet's move on and go to Jack good afternoon\nFeel got a question about garlic a clue you plant a reflection on the end result when you go to\nA normally not um as long as they're healthy close what really matters is your soil ... your soil the type of soil that isn't the nutrients in your soil will matter more than you know if you do a a close it's only a quarter of an inch\nAround yeah that's not a healthy clover I'm going to say but all of a larger close will be better but as the soil the nutrients in the soil the type of soil they're going to matter a lot more and that you're planning in sunny location rather than a shady location will matter also so those are the big\nMike close to that issue is most of my friends were supposed to give me some of the one that but that ground I'll get my garden close you all\nBack oh yeah I remember that he was supposed to give me some beautiful\nBut it got very suddenly\nI'm mad as well you know he gave me a groundhog can you really trust them\nI don't know [laughter] [laughter] hey thanks a lot of fear welcome it\nAll right again if you're planning garlic you got to get it it I mean you're getting getting late to put garlic in the ground I if you do put it in the ground it will still come up this year\nOn it and you want to get the growth this year on your garlic and then as it gets up there you don't want to necessarily mulch it right away you want to get warm hopefully we'll get more warm this year to get it's spreading and going and then you do want to mulch it probably\nUm more already in the middle of the month the are going to want to mulch it probably in November\nOn that we do have open lines at three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven and Rick you're on the air\nI feel I have a question on garlic also okay or years I have planted the elephant guard yeah earlier I write\nAnd it was always so dirty clothes and break underground and it just didn't look right and the clothes\nReally much to large [laughter] anyways I planted some\nGiven some it's much smaller and I I don't know the difference between heart attacks or whatever but he said you're not make the garlic is with any other other they cross or is there a problem or what\nThey normally do not cross per\nSe um\nBecause you aren't planning the seed heads on top are distributing them out that way\nBut a lot of times they don't get along well I mean some crops don't grow well against other crops next to him companion planting it's called\nAnd so that's why a lot of them say you don't plan to your elephant garlic next to a soft neck and things like that yeah I didn't\nIntentionally but there's always something left behind\nRight it'll grow up and just\nThe planet twenty feet or further away that's when you don't have a problem it seems that the distance that I've heard\nI don't know you know how\nImportant it is but that's the distance diapers twenty feet for whatever reason\nOkay have you brought your passion flower and yeah I did this week yes\nI'll do it\nYeah it's again it's it's been minds you know at the porch so it's been protected but it hasn't frosted in my area but it's cold enough to bring it in yes\nOkay All right thank you All right You're welcome\nAll right we do have all lines open at this time and again tropical plants has been getting colder so most tropical plants really need broad in at least in this area\nI Want to get down below forty five it's something you really gotta watch on it you don't want most of them to be frosted and most of them don't like it are below the forty five degree area you'll start to see more yellow wing of leaves\nWith a cooler temperature we'd been talking a best guess a lot of the weeks\nI'm here and there the tropical discuss on those not the hearty this 'cause you have a new yards but you'll see the yellow new leads if they're still outside\nAnd different plants like that um bring 'em in when you do bring in those plans you do want a hose him off the little bit of pressure on the foliage gender side of the leaves the top the leads in case there are any\nEggs from insects on those on that foliage or any just insects on the phone would you want to knock that off also before you bring 'em in there could be insects in the soil also that's a little bit harder to take care of\nCan using insecticide\nAnd just put that on the soil working through that won't get rid of any eggs in the soil but if there are insects in the soil that will take care of that part before you bring 'em in al says just regular\nMeasures you want to take to try to get rid of any insects before you bring them in and let's go to Rob you're on the air\nHey how you doing very good sense for honor roll on these are like last year we put in twenty four hundred floats okay\nTurned out pretty nice a couple of things I Need to ask you recommend any fertilizer this time of the year when you put it in\nOkay how did your garlic do last year you said you know early\nWell we had a we had some good stuff we had to stop it didn't turn out that well uh last\nYear was a bad year for garlic because my theory is too much rain and the early ... now\nGot a high right so um besides your soil conditions or phosphorus for the development of the Bob's\nWould be something I Would add I don't know if you did any soil prep before you planted 'em or not\n[noise] ah you\nUsually what I'll do not take all my vegetables [noise] that was left over from the garden a lot of Ron on top a mix in a
