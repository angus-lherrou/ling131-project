tight or we just be responding to conditions for him that's up to ... percent inflation and a two percent but ... let's just say that's normal well\nDo your three percent inflation shouldn't you have a three percent but ... does that mean anything's actually any tighter oh\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year the what are the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle is and I think\nWhatever politics are done uh there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the terms okay well maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only going to rate hikes at alternating meeting okay um\n[noise] even if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the terms a\nKey and then even if that rate hike was a mistake that slow the economy right there's no way that we have the slightest pick on anybody or anything for months and so the idea that that would make anybody\nYou know less satisfied with Republican leadership um and it was the vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narratives [noise] ah it it's just absurd it's just that whatever affect the fed will have it\nIt's going to head it's sort of they have it so you know if it's going to the election it already has\nWell let's talk about in terms I mean you have you've gone out there and said that you know midterms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record on this it's quite clear it seems that with the economy is strong or weak with the president is popular unpopular what tends to happen\nIs whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house is okay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system so little unique but the [noise] so we see it here but for most people politics\nIs like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every four years so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around is I'm a crafts four years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially on the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some\nRespects metastasize as we see the additional tariffs um you know they've they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities and Chinese equities ... you know you were tracking that but what happened after this announcement\nQuestion because what's been happening all during this trade war which really started in March is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up and Chinese toxic ... straight straight down there that don't write their market\nAnd their currencies done the same thing so if you're a non Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy Chinese stocks you got hit both ways on the stocks and the currency like sister to thirty five percent\nThis year [noise] so what happened after sort of the worst of all the ... came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up and the Chinese stock market went up twice as much so that wasn't supposed\nTo have [laughter] yeah\nI'm One of the things that was driving the sink or an early conclusion\nWas the financial pressure being put on the Chinese by their stock market by their currency market by their bond market and all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signal to the Chinese
