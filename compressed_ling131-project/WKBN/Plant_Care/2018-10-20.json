just quite have you ever tried to start trees from the a K A yeah Perry trees apple trees\nYeah we have started them but the reason we have done that is for a route stock purpose\nFor standard rowing fruit trees you can do it or we've done over the apples we're done with peach et cetera but only for a route stock purposes because if you grow them\nFor the purpose of fruit\nIt will take over ten years on my way\nGet fruit um if you're taking them from let's say a Honeycrisp\nApple that you've eaten and you plan it out um you know you plan out in the fall you will normally get something in the spring [noise] not guaranteeing it's gonna be a Honeycrisp ... or whatever\nYou ate because you're getting it from an orchard which has a lot of different apples\nOn it so it's gonna be a seed laying apple\nThe normally the apple is possibly and not always going to be a little bit thorny or have spurs on it um it's always an adventure but don't plan on getting fruit\nFor at least ten years and the tree would have to normally be Fifteen to twenty foot tall and you might get a new variety you might get something as fantastic\nAs a Honeycrisp or a John a gold or it might be something as crappy is the worst apple you've ever seen\nYeah [laughter] yeah you never know what's going to revert back I regret is that what that guy regression yes yeah OK well ten years or I'm too old to wait for\nThat here [laughter] but you know you could have the miracle of miracles ... clear fruit on two years and be amazing but you just don't know\n[laughter] I'm not sure [laughter] All right well good effects are right You're welcome\nRight again we have all open lines at this time three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven\nAnd that's why fruit trees are grafted and ... they are not grown from seed because you want a tree and a semi door door et cetera on those you normally start to get fruit and it depends on\nAll situations you can start to get fruit in two or three years and if you drive around and you look at orchards most of the orchards the trees are going to maybe be ten foot Fifteen foot tall you're not going to see the orchards of the old days like I still have some that were planted by my dad\nSee as old as I Am there probably fifty years old and I still have some of those that are I keep them down to about twenty foot tall or just to manage them and spray 'em but you don't see the large fruit trees any more 'cause a lot easier to manage to semi door for the door fruit trees\nAnd they bear a lot sooner than the standard ones so let's move on Mary you're on the air\nI get by high drank Jeb Bush if they're on the east side of my house you ... what do I need to protect him come where [noise]\nUm how long have they been in or is this the first year\nTwo years\nOkay and they survive last year okay\nBut late ... that should they go ahead please burlap that a good idea\nUm if they survive last year and you make sure there's good moisture in the ground\nUm you can do the burlap but they probably should be okay this year you can put mulch again around them or leaves around them if you do leaves do up six or eight inches and do that in early December\nLast winter comes in with blizzard whether in November which you never know you know um that's really all you should have to do how tall are they\nThey're probably not tropic just Hi okay so they're ... yes yeah\nSo you could mound them with leaves I wouldn't go with anything heavier than that maybe up the six twelve inches again in early December and uncover I'm In late march but the main thing is to make sure they've got moisture in the ground\nSo they don't dry out you can burlap ... because they're on the east side\nThere well protected from the wins\nThe north in the west wins I don't think you really need to burlap them they survive last winter and they'll probably survive this winter unless we get down to minus thirty or something like that you know the odds are the odds are pretty low against that but and it hasn't happened for literally years upon years so you should be good\nSpringtime she cut the fact that like right now there's a lot of dead yeah like the young marathon check back in a Springer\nYeah you could cut the blooms off now oh really yeah cut the blooms off now and since it's only twelve or Eighteen Inches tall I probably would not do any other pruning except maybe to round the top off just to make a look a little bit nicer but I don't know what type it is unless you do\nOkay you know I don't have a great\nPride and I assume it's a variety is supposed to get taller than Eighteen Inches is my guess so I Would let it go and fertilize it next spring also okay with even an acid type fertilizer or granular that you can sprinkle around for acid loving plants\nThat next spring just to try to help out a little bit alright\nAlright thank you very much You're welcome thanks for the call I buy All right let's move on Bob\nGood afternoon how
