{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "And doctors out there and who I understand that you can do way better by changing your diet and improving your health doing the things we know that work but basically your doctor is there to help you over the hump if you're really in bad shape so let me\nTell you about uh you know because I'm always talking about this blood ... thing and how you know it's a thickness of your blood did either inhibits health or creates a health and I'll go to my grave believing that because the research is so profound and my experience is so deep with that and even seeing in in my patients\nWell I Want to tell you about a study that Dr Neil Bernard\nBernard who is a medical doctor and a here's a quote from him in an article that he did for the Atlantic magazine\nSo he says weight gain aside because that is a different variable why do vegetarians have lower blood pressure many people will say it's because of plant based diet is rich and potassium\nThat seems to lower blood pressure however I think there is a more important factor\nThis costs city how secure bloody is technically this is me speaking technically this ... the resistance to flow but if you want to think about it as thickness that's fine you know let's let's you know leave it at that that's an easy way to look at it\nBut Bernard goes on to say eating saturated fat has been linked to various or to viscous blood and the risk for high blood pressure according to the world Health Organization as compared to Paul and saturated fat he paid sin image of bacon grease in a panic\nCool seconds that's kind of what happens in your blood folks when you eat the animal fats [noise] so you know will pick up on that when we get back and I'll take one more phone call when we come back thanks for listening [noise]\nFrom [noise]\n\nNeed home technique over that spies here to help turn them into free consultation once he signed due to perfect tack we can deliver it and make sure it's working before I really think that there were times we weren't all your attack on the type that by the fact that was awful\nWelcome back to incredible health what Dr David ... go\nOkay we're back and we're running short on time and I want to take one more phone call but first I Need to put a shameless plug in for my practice I didn't say anything about this yet I'd better do something so um if you need chiropractic care I'm I've been in practice for over Thirty years in Colombia and we've helped probably\nI Would bet around ten thousand or more patients in all those years so we've seen a lot of patients I've seen a lot of different issues I use the old fashioned chiropractic techniques are used therapies I use ah spinal ... non surgical spinal decompression do really disc problems and a leg pain\nAnd as usual if you come in a four remind nutritional consultation fifty bucks we'll get you a half hour to an hour with me which I think is incredibly generous but I Love talking to people and I love helping people find solutions to their problems\nSo that's my spiel on my phone numbers three three zero for eight to nine five five zero that's for eight to nine five five zero my wife Denise or I Will answer the phone because we run the practice that's the way we like it\nAnd a nice he's a sweetie and she'll get you set up that come in and visit with us so All right I'm gonna take a phone call this is Jack from boardman hello Jack how are you\nGood morning I'm man in perfect health and that is according to my work of about a month ago it came back near perfect on every aspect I take no medications no fried food just for what you had mentioned many times and very little red meat\nI I'm I'm\nCalling because I I'm a firm believer in the preventive maintenance and and I heard you on Dan River show a few months ago and then I found out later that you were going to be have your own show and it'd be so informative I just had to call in this morning I let you know\nI I really appreciate it if you have a question you need not the rush you but I'm kind of short on time so if you have a question make sure you get through it here\nOkay I'm going to mention right now and I purchased your book and I found it very informative and in a very very happy\nMoney well spent thank you sir I only question you if you don't mention fish oil okay and you don't mention juicing ... although in your book you mentioned briefly smoothies okay you know I don't plan to ... to be a hundred years old but I Am a maintenance why not\nJak [laughter] I knew I disagree with that one look a hundred hundred and twenty really conceivably we are designed\nTo live a hundred and Twenty years health fully to the end of our lives fall asleep when I entered sleep and that's the way we should be but\nWe all the way I look at it I don't plan to burden on my wife for anyone else you're not yet I don't plan to check out in a nursing right\nYou'll you'll be fine that look or hang up and I'll answer your questions for an fish oil and using okay read quite frankly surfer call and thanks for the compliment okay so on fish will yeah fish oil I think is probably one of the supplements most people probably should take\nBecause ah there have been many studies the nurses study the famous nurses study or things like that when we consume more oily fish we tend to do better with us because of the D. H. A. or the mega three fatty acids in it\nAnd those are helpful for us so if you're going to get some kind of boils you know in the fish oil that's probably a good way to go National Institutes of health says one to three grams of fish oil or of um omega three fatty acids that day is a good idea\nAnd when they say something about a supplement like that you probably ought to heat it and maybe do it because they don't really make recommendations or supplements juicing I think you're better off eating the whole fruits and vegetables\nChewing them up really well mainly because of vitamin C. is a fragile vitamin when you use it you might lose some but it surely better than not taking in the fruits and vegetables and it's a good alternative to get your going so hey Dr David ... thank you for listening come back next Sunday and I promise more good stuff\nSo how much on I mean ... what the food truck vote for him\nThey're different prices it depends on which one I'm I'm looking for I think I'm going to do a trailer trucks if you're a motor transmission go your stack if you get a trailer I can pull it in anywhere like they can't feel fairground I don't believe you could just pull your

know I I Wish you well because it just seems like you're you're like I said you are a very positive force and\nLot of people uh I've had I've had I'm On my gosh are ... ... ... ... who\nIs a she's the lady behind redhead why that she's one of your big is the biggest cheerleader than she is a\nA very she's a force of nature self and if she's impressed by you I think I told you that if she impressed by you there must be something very special going on with you\nI'm impressed by her and of course you know her family has the winery and she started that when she well\nShe wanted to be a winemaker when she was three years old she don't have to do what she's doing so she inspires me because he's all over the world hustling getting that wine out there when she really didn't have to she's putting in the work\nI Believe she's twenty four years old and she's a as a ended up by the way the winery ... winery\nA in a political ... I Believe that's low ville right on the other side of Poland and um\nAnyway just as she is a fascinating story she's being honored and and all over the place that I 'cause I see this she definitely making a name for herself every Youngstown but as I said when somebody like that it's taken interest in you and also I\nNoticed you do have dealings with of the federal I did you have something going on\nI'm damn martini just difference um\nHe calls me when I'm cooking whatever I'm doing I I just be amazed because he has a full blown restaurant and he calls me like what you got what you're cooking and when I get off how drop panzer rolls off down near when he had big gangs he's calling and he's like one of my biggest supporters and and I'm just thankful to have friends like that\nWell and that is a very good thing and as I said I just you know the thing is we\nWe can talk about the one of the great things about America does that still this is a place where somebody can come from humble beginnings and really if they just push hard enough you know I Know they say it's getting harder and harder and that maybe this generation won't do as well as their parents and all that kind of stuff but the opportunities are still there did\nYou have a go fund me for your food truck or you just uh\nI'm I'm working on one my my uh cause some Christian on which you may know her she's she's um\nI think she's a president of the young dams\nWide dad was a county engineer office I mean she has several titles that's who's been helping me out along the way that would keep me in line 'cause I Know that I Can't get out there and just do anything on social media because their respect to half her her job and was she was doing for me\nAnd a ... charity knows too right there those are the forces behind a freshman catering\nBetter by the way I Am familiar with them is all me and she is or she is the driving force as well\nSo what what uh well what what's been your biggest a disappointment I mean we're talking about the positive but what what\nYou know it causes your swimming upstream when you're an entrepreneur and and uh what what is what set back at me I'm sure I'm sure you've overtime but what was your husband your biggest set back so far\nI've overcome and I'm going to overcome but my biggest set back is\nPeople not letting you in in the community when they know that you have a brand that you're doing great and that you can make a whole bunch of money for yourself in a lot of people but it's just certain areas will not let you be great but I had to show them different I don't wait on doors open I open their myself [laughter]\nNow and and and I I'm just not waiting on anybody to do anything for me you know I Know that God gave me this he showed me this he cannot live so I keep it moving to do everything you know the ups and downs I deal with racism I deal with hatred or I'll go in a location make good money\nAnd they'll say come on we'll do this than other and then when they see my following and they see what I Do it's like okay I'm taking something away from them when that's enough money for everybody so I\nJust continue to stay humble because of where I'm going is great and I'm not going to have to worry about none of that so I just keep pushing so I've got your chicken roles what else did you bring me here I just [noise]\nOkay that is from Darla sugar pan is you know I always left\nAt an entrepreneur um rather they're cooking promoting whatever they're doing so that was from a party from Yvette Goldman fiftieth birthday party last night and it was huge it was that the devil tree right in a dental tree said that so far that is the most elegant party they have had in that venue um that's far\nA lot of people seems to be the talking point is now dead well something happened to Dr Ford but ah we're not ... you know I don't think she just basically missed identified a Kavanaugh\nWhich may or may not be true it seems that the final when the final tally with than most of the people they said that they didn't feel that the evidence was compelling enough\nTo vote against Kavanaugh so now he is our justice\nBut well I don't want to talk about is the other side of the coin and that is democratic strategy\nWhere you have a situation where you know and I went back and forth with a woman on on Facebook about this because she ... she ... she's more interested in these people voting uh for the virtue and all that I get that but the simple fact is in a situation where Democrats are in the minority and in the house and in the Senate\nThere is a good chance that you've got to\nTwo ... two female Democrats who voted against Kavanaugh and they're red state Democrats so they were already in a shaky position I'm Talking about Claire McCaskill and Heidi Hi Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp of a\nSouth Dakota or the north Dakota hold on I'll have to look that up but uh once again I forgot my password\nSo I'll be working off my phone today but\nI also the thing is my point is I'm\nI look at this as a chess game I look at a strategically I and I think some people don't look at it that way and I think that so oh great so they voted their conscience but in a ultimately to Democrats might lose two Senate seats was it worth it because ultimately\nThe next Supreme Court justice was going to be a conservative Republican because they run everything so was this battle war fighting we'll be talking about that and more that three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven time ...

nine Ninety nine menu nine great meals one great price oh Charlie's ...\nDot com where price sells cars and great service each customer [noise]\n\nThere where you go I thought there was a little hesitation there but the rock and roll continues\nTo freak now and I have a ... as usual on a Sunday Morning on the news radio five Seventy WKBD and and uh like I said a couple of things I Want to talk about as far as that goes and I'm as much as it pains me to say so it's undeniable this was a winning week for President Trump and that's what you need to look at I mean\nUh if you are part of the resistance of you are just a ... a general Democrat if you're undecided this is if you got to look at it that the\nThat the judge judge Kavanaugh became justice Kavanaugh despite the best efforts of the Democrats despite all the protests um that uh unemployment is at the lowest rate is since Nineteen sixty nine that's just undeniable that that is a fact\nAnd there are there are other things that the president can hang his hat on also\nI when I'm Talking about democratic strategy I think all of the unintended consequences some of the protests and the fact that these allegations were brought up a at the last minute and of course there's no doubt whether you believe Dr Ford about this with\nPolitical gamesmanship on the part of Democrats undeniably\nBut at a certain point it can work against you these things tend to backfire if you're a member of you know your history when uh the Republicans a impeached Bill Clinton\nUh he didn't have to leave office but he was indeed impeached ah he got to stay in office by one vote ultimately Clinton rebounded and the ... the whole thing back fired for the Republicans\nThe unintended consequences in this case is that\nSome people thought that the attacks on judge Kavanaugh were a strictly political they thought and of course the people who never believed doctor for the first place so why did she wait so long and all this kind of thing so this has had the unintended consequences I just said for the third time of actually\nGalvanizing the right galvanizing Republicans who had been kind of complacent up to this point most of the energy was on the Democratic side and and most a pulse still indicate the Democrats have a good chance to take the house but now you\nHave by your actions are Democrats inadvertently uh fired up the Trump crowd\nSo there you go but\nWe'll see I'm Still not a fan of the president I'll give like I said you just heard that the rare time I'll give them credit if he had a good week but here's what I Do here is one of the things I don't like about the president earlier this week the president was asked about a doctor for it and her testimony and ah this is what he had to say\n[noise] [noise] well I'm going to let the Senate handle that the decisions and they reject full bird professional\nVery good just hear a little bit about it because I've been with the presidents of Julie and we're\nTalking about some very important subjects but uh I'm sure it will all be very good I I guess the vote was positive for this seems to be in LA [noise] I'll learn more about it as the day goes on and I just sort of added a because we were together for what is your words [laughter]\nI told her testimony was very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman [noise] very fine woman [laughter] and I thought\nOkay well let's let's go there okay so bear he starts out saying that and then a few days later it was even forty eight hours later he was at one of his rallies where he's got you know he always gets pumped up and he always says the most outrageous things when he's sitting around a bunch of people who love him and then he says this\nShouldn't happen [noise] what he's going through [noise] thirty six years ago\nI had one [noise] right I Want to be [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one there how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where was I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise]\n[noise] [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know [noise]\nSo you go from saying that her testimony was very compelling she's fine woman to basically mocking her in front of a friendly crowd so that's one of the things I don't like about him and I never will I just think okay great you know let him pursue his agenda even though I agree with a whole lot of it I mean I disagree with a whole lot of it\nBut I still will never get over I Will never accept this nastiness this turn on a dime a aspect of his you know where he'll say the right thing at the right time but then when he's really being himself\nHe can't suppress the nastiness and but even more disturbing to me is that that that friendly crowd\nLoved every minute of it\nSo so I think my depression on election night with well found that I think that as I told a friend a lecture night twenty sixteen I don't know my country anymore\nAnd I don't like this behavior and I'd I Will never accept this as the way a president should behave but I'm Glad a lot of you are happy and uh your guys and and your guys winning right now so I gave him credit when he went\nAlso a lot of the things I got a letter from Santa Claus and he doesn't get it either Scott sends me a a calendar that says Trump one Hillary last CNN sucks well for well let me tell you this you miss the point I think I just explain why I don't like the president okay and as far as Hillary Clinton goes I forgot about her election night\nSome people did and some people are still wringing their hands but that wasn't the point but by the way sir Santa Claus or by the way you know what I like it when people are they take the eggs at me but they're not man enough to tell me who they are you're not Santa Claus okay but this was going\nWith the economy that we have right now and destroy it because you're going to have to pay for the huge tax cuts that went to the wealthy\nI Do agree with you it's going to track I Do agree\nThere that this this uh the the tax you know one and a half trillion dollars of a tax break in this new tax policy uh is not paid for it they didn't pay for this yet it will they claim pay for itself in time but I think it's you know for sure I think uh the\nThe ... Republicans and the president or disingenuous when they give no credit to the economic progress made under rock Obama but I think it you have to say it is what it is that because of these tax breaks them because of the cuts of regulations that\nUh you gotta give after Eighteen months or more in office you got to give the president some credit for where we are now for sure for ... it wasn't a total disaster\nBefore he got here as he likes to say they'd like to pretend if you look at where we were unemployment was cut in half under Obama so it didn't go down as low as it is now but it was cut in half so to pretend that didn't happen is certainly ally but\nIt's a continuation of Obama but that's what it is but\nTo say it's not strictly a continuation because policies have been an act that by this president and so I have to you know and I and I try to be an honest broker on this as much as I tell you which way I lean but I'm not going to just say you can't\nGive Donald Trump any credit for where the economy is right now because I don't think that would be accurate but we can agree to disagree there but we shall see what happens so basically uh do you as I was talking about earlier do you think the Democrats should\nLess focus on the midterms and forget about the Kavanaugh matter it settles or do you think that\nThey are they taking after this forward and when these elections and then come back to capping off because I don't think it's ten ...\nOkay I'm going to sit there along\nI K and I'll just say I just think it'd be a big mistake to go after him politically but if I Do hear a lot of people and that's what they want to do and as I said I just don't think they're thinking strategically but we shall see I thank you for sharing your your opinions or Lisa\nThank you okay have a good day and let's keep it moving up next is a up next to Steven Warren hello Steve\nMorning how are you pretty good I'm Sorry leases brain dead but\nWell let's let's just start off by not insulting people what's on your mind\n[noise] yeah I well first and foremost I Want to thank President Trump\nI I Want to thank him for inspiring the Republican Party for leading them\nTo a place where they realize it is okay to stand up and fight back against propaganda and live from the left\nWhat ... what she didn't realize the Democrats have left or the wife does have left the Democratic party and went to a socialist agenda that is a mainstream issue within the Democratic party\nThey left people and what is happening as a moderate and the independence\nIf they have any sense or actually realizing oh my gosh so the Democrats have are so far left there is absolutely I don't I Can't vote Democrat because of their social\nWill have to go to the Republican side\nAnd there is some of that going on and I do believe I Do believe that there is a a battle within the Democratic party from traditional Democrats than the ones that want to go farther left I have no doubt that that's true but I I don't think that uh I don't know that you're speaking for all independence or all people\nI think some people who are not motivated by Hillary Clinton they didn't like her and they didn't like the president's will they stayed home during the presidential election maybe some of those Democrats will get out\nI Do believe that that uh that I Know you don't believe the polls because they were wrong and twenty six team but most polling still indicates the Democrats have an edge history is on the side of Democrats usually when a report of the party that's in charge usually the midterms go to the other party just as a matter of balance it happened with Obama it happened with Clinton it it\nIt happens so uh you may be right but I think there are some people that\nThey feel that this president and have a check and balance and every Democrat is not a Bernie Sanders or a you know I'm like Alexandria Casey oh Cortez ah there's still plenty of good old fashioned Democrats out they're not named one\nWell I don't think Chuck I don't see Chuck Schumer is being so far left as a Bernie Sanders who is not a Democrat but he runs the Democrat and I have a problem with that in itself but I don't I there are other I'll look at mansion mansion voted for Kavanaugh he's a Democrat\nI mean I just think what you make these absolute statements and I just don't think it's accurate Steven yes there is a a socialist contingency in the Democratic party but by the way bear in mind that a lot of younger people ... up to forty percent of younger people they don't see socialism as a bad word\nBernie Sanders got significant vote since at least three or four states so apparently there is an appetite for this does it work coast to coast I don't believe so I Believe that go ahead\nWell there's appetite based on ignorance you\nKnow because they don't agree with you doesn't mean it's ignorance even that means that maybe they want to try something different\nAnd it's been tried ever since the beginning of time there's not been one time in history where it's been successful\nThe majority of our allies in Europe and in Scandinavia have some form of socialism there'll be older Democrats to hold on just a minute and we're back after this\n[noise] you've\nGot to nap so [laughter]\nThan welcome back and let's go right back to see even let him finish just thought and go ahead Steven [laughter]\nYeah I'm Sorry but you know there's sort of with leaving scanning parts were say they're not socialist there are specific policy you could argue socialist but what what happens is that any socialist country ends up going bankrupt\nWill not anyway you know they don't pay for their own military they don't innovate anything and how do they take it back from their cars innovations healthcare um they have a lower standard\nThat's absolutely false if you look at the if you by the way the the very example you cite a higher standard a longer lifespan better medical care\nIn a way into\nThe leading America has has almost half of the top one hundred hospitals\nThat are absolutely sir and that is true but I Will say to make it ... ... you know the the ... the the Fox News argument that every socialist country ends up like\nVenezuela is totally false when you do have no they're not they may not even the socialist but when you look at the situation there all the guess what the twenty first century may end up being the Chinese Century they are very close and you're right they stole a lot from us to get there but the Chinese are coming on strong I'm not advocating I'm not saying they're better than us but what I'm saying is\nThat when you look at a when you look at a lifespan when you look at a time and time again Denmark has been described as the happiest country on earth because guess what they don't have to worry about\n... yeah but it's feelings and and but they but guess what they have a smaller house they're small they are they make less money than us before taxes they make less money than us after tax\nAnd they're yeah because they're they are tax at a higher rate no doubt about it on the you know I'm just when I hear a lot of these people whining about ah taxes\nAnd everything I'm willing to pay more but that's just me I don't expect every American to be like me I Would pay more taxes for a better healthcare system that is you know something that's there for me I I Would like to get\nOut their system is ... is for everybody if they're willing to participate in it unfortunately the biggest problem with health care if people think that they can just go buy health insurance after they're sick you have to participate and it\nWas so bad for you maybe you would be against so you want to see a doing away with the uh the exclusion of pre existing conditions you're saying that if okay St ...\nA county hospital or something somewhere or some emergency room with it has to the hospital as to\nEat it but anyway I just wanted to get that out there I understand I understand what\nWe're I mean by the way let's look Ohio has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country the state of Ohio how's that possible\nAnd it shouldn't be that way and it's even higher among black uh children\nHere we are in twenty Eighteen and the greatest country on the face of the earth and yeah we've got a lot of things going for us and we do lead in innovation in so many of these medical procedures but\nThe simple fact is there are people in other places around the world that don't have to worry about losing everything just because they get sick and as far as a tool that caller's you know that\nThat ... he's a Scrooge approach to what why ah to pre existing conditions\nI liked that I like knowing guess what yeah I'm sick but I still need a doctor and yes should they be paying all along yes I totally agree that's why even though uh that's why I like that aspect of Obamacare saying everybody's got to be in this thing so that uh that's how you sustain it\nBut to the ... what I'm afraid of is that there are people out there who are free riders and they wait until they get sick and then they utilize the system but you know I'm Sorry if I'm feeling again here but I think a great country should also have compassion and that\nYou shouldn't say well I I'm Sorry uh hey sorry for your luck that you got cancer but that's that's all your problem\nAnd when there's so much wealth in this country when there's so many resources that can be used to a cushion that blow I don't think anybody should have to go broke in this country just because they got sick through no fault of their own in some cases not sure if you're smoking three packs a day and you're\nYou're drinking a case of beer every night while you're you lead your condition but there's some people it just happens or babies just born with certain defects um I suppose the torture\nMuscles are punished that family because of the uh the cards they were dealt I think not I think we're better country than that but apparently some people will find just throwing up to the walls\nAnd I I have a problem with that so that's just my personal opinion I Want to hear yours now had three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven up next as Billy and he's in butler hillbilly\nAnd more and more as\nWell you know when when you're talking to previous conversation here the you know what you're talking there is sixty two percent of your income tax write off the bat before we start paying their taxes that's what they're doing in Europe\nYou know right now in this country we have half the population aren't even paying any federal income tax under under what what you envisioned they're having in Europe they beeped and sixty two percent of their income\nSo let me say this goes this is where I disagree with the far left I think everybody should be paying taxes I don't care how poor you are maybe not make you think twice about dropping babies you can afford and all that so I think everybody should be paying taxes\nYou know and you know because again the uh\nTo you know I mean you were you were somewhat somewhat right today when you when you were talking about when you pointed out the fact that you know they're not completely the socialist because all the wealth that that that is generated these countries come from capitalism where you have where you have no capitalism you have nothing but property\nYou know they are because basically\nHuman nature people are going to do things in their own self interest you cannot force people to be altruistic\nAnd that's that's what the left was oh we think we can change mankind we can make them you know there there it doesn't matter how much we tax to regulate them they're going to continue to produce that is that's just asinine stupid it has never worked in the history of the world\nBy the way I don't want to over I don't want to be out on an overbearing tax system and all that I Do agree they pay me by American Standards tremendous ... ... they pay tremendous taxes and a lot of ... percent yes and and also they they are paying a whole lot more for their fuel and all this stuff that's just\nBut they're used to it over there but a lot of them I've heard a lot of them man on the street interviews with a lot of them in different sources BBC George of Ella other places and they seemed to be happy with their quality of life they feel like they get what they paid for\nWhat you you can you can find the same people that are that are living in in this country on on the urban plantation oh I'm I'm happy with you know what government does for me I'm very happy to continue the Democrat\nYou know it I I don't want to you know I I I'm I'm just happy I don't want to have to worry about anything well I don't want to be part of that that plantation my freedom\nAnd let me ask you about it after the Syrian here okay but real quick\nLast week that that stuck in my mind you said you want them to leave you alone when you say that what do you mean by that leave you alone how do you feel that the government or whatever\nForces out there are are are bothering you I'm trying to cause that really stuck with me\nIt's very simple as far as ... I Believe I Believe the government has to functions protect me from external enemies and protect me from internal enemies I mean let me\nLet me let me live my life and peace I I Want to I Want to be able to lead a peaceful life a lot in pretty worried about like mobs of people coming through trying to take what I have or whatever and I want to be able to enjoy the fruits of my labor that's that's not what the Democrats want to do\nTo them that they want a mandate everything you do ... ban it it's just one or the other I mean one of the guns they want to take my guns away\nThey know they don't want to take your gun on way way back to some place where I Can't I Can't find a job really wait a minute let me ask\nYou that I'm On the gun issue you know that I have heard that yeah there are some fringe people out there who would like to take your guns but the majority of people that are talking about regulating these things and you know the constitution even talks about a well regulated\nMilitia so I think it's just I get sick of that argument that they want to take your guns nobody's saying take your guns the asking\nIf maybe I was in Florida should an Eighteen year old kid be able to walk in and and with mental problems and buy a gun that day and go kill people three days later I don't see how that's infringing upon anything it just seems like common sense to me\nBut let's talk about ...\nThe goal here is is that disarm the I mean 'cause when when the difference we are in this country and then say like say like a place like the United kingdom\nWere were citizens we have ... I mean we we can we can defend ourselves we can I mean we have the ultimate dining look what's happening down in Venezuela where they've taken away all their rights are literally destroying their country they're just reducing them to nothing and they're trying to fight back into the government and all they have a ...\nOr is that government it but that's that's the difference\nAnd I okay now what will move on after that but also the difference in Venezuela that they don't point out on Fox News and right wing radio is that this thing was totally loves being sustained by my it was totally been sustained by Petro the petrochemical industry and when when oil went down\nUh and when the ... the previous leader died this new guy is terrible and he's driven the whole thing into the ground

... on a Sunday under the previous caller you know Billy I gave you the\nTime and I know where you went back and forth there but I always enjoy talking to you is just I've got other callers move onto but you're always welcome to call we can even agree on some things as I said I think we do agree on the point that I think going after a if the dams do take the house going after\nJustice Kavanaugh would be a strategic mistake but we'll see what happens because ah I just think the Democrats need to focus more on issues and some of these side show\nThings are are distractions and they have had unintentional\nConsequences as far as energizing the Republicans and uh the more you know like even today there still crowds of people in Washington\nA judge Kavanaugh is now justice Kavanaugh\nWhy they are still out there they're welcome and they're exercising their First Amendment rights as long as they do so peacefully I understand\nBut I think when you do longer or something like that goes on there is always the chance that this is when these these fringe e people can get involved the the people that you hear about on ... and so they wouldn't say that\nThousands of people were protesting peacefully and it was all good it's only takes a handful of idiots tomorrow this thing and then his next to rally the president would use that to brush all everybody on the left with the bad actions of a handful of people so I just say\nProceed with caution look at the big picture the big picture right now if you're on the left should be the midterm elections\nWhich could be very consequential if you're a Democrat that's what you need to focus on take that energy and focus it on these upcoming elections were ... were thirty four days out by the way I Believe\nThat all this week I Want to say it's a Tuesday is your last day to register to vote\nSo bear that in mind let's get this done regardless of which way you're voting Tuesdays your last day to register to vote so please get out there register and follow through and vote\nBut I Do believe that and I'm hoping that this all the these midterm elections will be a a redemption for the pollsters who missed it so badly in the presidential election they are saying\nTo a to a poll I haven't seen a single poll says that the Republicans should keep the house\nIf the Democrats do indeed take the house as predicted there should be some redemption for the pollsters it should also be some repudiation for the current president of United States if it goes the other way though\nIt means that the Democrats need to do some serious soul searching because if if they fail to win the house it I guess it means everybody's fine with the way things are so we shall see will know soon enough all arguments and ... will be settled in uh the first to use the November\nBut let's go to the number here and thank you for the full bank a call the number three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven let's talk to\nA truck in

you are contributing that you you know if you're having if if you know you shouldn't be worried about going broke because the medical expenses or because of all this other stuff when we can take care of that\nBut uh you're ... and by the way what I just went through another factoid out while I'm at it I just got something from a friend of mine and even though we're we're talking about this great economy do you realize that we paid almost half a trillion in fact more than half a trillion dollars\nOn the debt interest in fiscal twenty Eighteen just on the interest of our debt we paid half a trillion dollars this is not sustainable so we are going to have to make some decisions but go ahead\nI'll get into the from other time but let me just say so\nLike I said healthcare their education

I Wish this call or whatnot deal in generalities that the simple fact is to say that\nThat all countries that have even the width of socialism end and failure is just not accurate\nThat they may be capitalistic country but they have taken some aspects of socialism and integrated into their government and many of these countries are the better for it\nIf we don't want to move in that direction that's fine but I Do believe that they're you\nKnow let's realize historically speaking that uh there was a time when Social Security and Medicare were considered considered socialist programs but now we have a situation where many Americans in their last days on this earth if they didn't have those programs that would be probably be totally destitute\nAnd and some of the very people who are ... you know I listen to this commercial a minute ago with Bill Johnson talking about Social Security\nI don't think the Republicans are the party to go to to try to save Social Security but we'll see what happens there they talk a good game at election time just like Portland talking about he's kissed concern with the opioid crisis when there was when he voted down a program that would have increased funding to deal with this\nSo you know there's a lot of people talking out of both sides of their mouth let's remember\nThat this is the party likes to call Social Security and Medicare earned benefits I mean part of me to like to call them entitlements that's Paul Ryan's favorite it's not an entitlement it's an earned benefit you paid into\nAnd uh as I said for all the early criticism court cases against Social Security and Medicare now a lot of those same people the ones who are still alive from those days\nAnd their descendants are beneficiaries of the very programs that they were opposed to because at the end of the day they found out that guess what I don't care how hard you work or how hard you try sometimes bad things happen to good people and it's nice to know\nThat at the end of the road there something coming to you something and I like to live in a world like that they'll do I want the government to control everything in my life no I don't but I Would like to think of I'm living in the greatest country on the face of the earth I have certain expectations as a citizen and I don't think that makes me a taker because\nI'm Talking about contributing and getting back what I put in oh by the way and I don't mind if some of my money help somebody else's on hard times\nBut I guess that makes me a liberal [noise]\nWhen time is high noon

can you know but at the same time it was a fool's errand because okay so as I said earlier if you don't if it was a ham it was going to be another conservative Republican so it was a it was a fool's errand just as likely\nI I I really think they weren't interested in finding the truth at all I I think they were just kind of somehow beyond the midterms and with the hope of flipping the house and and kind of dragging this out coal corny corny honestly I think that was the whole the whole game but\nI think there was as I said when I say gamesmanship that's what I mean I think there was a political calculus there but I think you've got to watch when you do those things because as I've been saying all morning and as if you heard during the news break the polling has tightened it appears that they've energize the Republicans and and uh I don't think that's what they set out to I think\nYou've than a hundred percent right on that I heard you say a couple times earlier that if they continue to go after him that it's going to backfire and I I think\nYou're going to be right if they if they continue to go after common are trying to go and run on the recruitment kind of agenda that sort of actually talking about ... people aren't going to really come out and vote for that\nAh yeah but because I think they kinda they tap into the me too movement which I Believe is a real concern I think there are women who have been victims of\nSexual harassment and even sexual assault ... over the years and and of course the cases of of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and all these other guys it proves that this stuff's going on I can remember and let's say you know and ... and I have to include the president of United States and that because\nOf the younger Donald Trump when I used to like him back in the eighties that was the ... that was a sex drugs and rock and roll era and guess what I mean I'm thinking this guy's got all these hot babes and all this stuff you know I I was looking at that I wasn't looking at I maybe had\nMatured to the point where I was concerned with the whole women's issue thing because\nUm I mean that's ... ... I Do if nothing else at least just started a dialogue on this stuff because I think there's a lot of people in America it it does amaze me when I see some of these guys mouthing some of this stuff and maybe they were chasing somebody skirt at one time just a few years ago but now suddenly\nThey're all down with the uh me too movement and I find it a little you know as well in fact I don't yeah I think\nThey're not really goes on and I think uh people were kind of kind of ... for a Laker fan and but I think we're not walk and this was the whole\nUh ... and her innocence before guilty what'd you do not agree with that\nOh I think there was that but I think you know the less look what's going on it but if you believe that I didn't mean they're still chanting that Trump rallies lock her up well guess what that ship has sailed there there's yeah I\nI agree I think we need to kind of let that go up that ...\nIts way old and the thing is you know or an Obama needs to be in jail too for what he's not charged with anything I've not heard any charges there is no indictment is when I look at the indictments most of them are around people who are used to rub elbows with Donald Trump yet uh we're supposed to be worried about\nA at a certain point I think if we can just reallocate some of that money I think it's a question of priorities\nAnd I think most people want these benefits to be there for them but if neither party has been able to make anything happen I don't know how we get there at the same time as I said earlier nobody wants to pay everybody wants to pay the bare minimum of taxes to get there\nAnd if you told me you know historically speaking like during World War two there was rationing of above a sugar and and people couldn't buy new cars and all that because everything went to the war effort\nI think the only way we can say these things just to take that kind of a moon shot attitude about it and I don't see that coming but go ahead\nI think there's two main points here when you take Social Security or sixty two when it was first developed it's supposed to last year or two and a half years three years\nAgo the life expectancy has greatly increased you're right\nRight and I think there were ten people paying into Social Security for every one person getting it so I think we need to take a look at both of those factors and makes a big adjustment number one\nHold on hold that thought let's leave I have a cliffhanger let's hold that thought and we'll get back to you after the news at the bottom of the hour and a very interesting always like hearing from the younger\nColor ... we hear from the old folks all the time don't we all news radio five Seventy WKBD or [noise] [laughter]\n... what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nIs perfect for decorating the house or just setting burying our companies might be ... with labor in mind when you know and your name\nIn swing make sure you break out all our great daily ... whether you're at home or the stadium knew I our radio ... collection that come out now\n\nI Seventy W.\nK. be and it's twelve thirty [noise]\nIn the valley police say they were called to a gas station that ate over by west market street for gunshots this morning officers say the main Darryl Dukes age forty eight died from a gunshot wound the department says detectives are investigating but they had no suspect\nSo far Youngstown police went to a homeland Potomac avenue for cause of a man threatening to shoot a woman on friday around twelve Fifteen PM she told police they were fighting over a water bill when he pulled out a gun when she threatened to kick him out of the house when police arrived\nThey say they found Michael Haynes age fifty three sitting in his wheelchair with a firearm next to him pains was charged and arrested with aggravated menacing in possession of drugs\nOne group is trying to take the edge off of new drivers today tire wrecked street survivor program teaches drivers with hands on exercises students can attend the course today at ... park classes began at eight o'clock this morning from the power Chevrolet view a gym see if can cut an Ohio newsroom I'm Jake\n... our next update Edwin just ahead more stimulating talk from the old Charlie's digital studios nine Ninety nine menu nine great meals one great price oh Charlie's\nSeventy W.

afternoon and of real quick ... there's going to be a peace march downtown Youngstown\nBecause this is a well I'll call it that actually is a nice it kicks off non violence week in Ohio and that was actually started by some students from Youngstown area so if you see a bunch of kids walking round purple shirts on such that's what's going on down there\nAnd um that is always I've actually been down there for that and it's just good to see these young people try to get ... politically involved even at a very young age\nAnd one more thing I just I was just looking at some ideas I'm Talking to alec and\nBoardman and alec I got some ideas for you here's one I'm looking at uh the from the Motley Fool which is an investment site um motley fools says hey here's an idea why don't we just\nOf why don't we just increased taxes on every working American right now now wait a minute not major we're talking about a payroll increase of\nBasically every body we pay an extra one point three three percent of going forward but this shower the shortfall ... there's no appetite for taxes but I mean\nOh no I I I I think you might be onto something there but looking at it from a different perspective payroll tax\nThat means you have a job you have to be working so we'd have more people pain is not the people who are already paying in paying more so the only way to do that is to have more people working to pay for those people collecting the benefits\nSo I'm absolutely for that but let's remember according to a recent him a unemployment report\nWhere at the lowest rate of you know unemployment is at the lowest rates in Nineteen sixty nine so a lot of people are working now and of course over the years it would fluctuate but I I just think you know I Would be open to paying one point\nWhat was at one point three three percent more on my taxes if I thought this was going to save this very good system that we have but nobody wants to do that it seems like a ... here's another they've got they've got about Fifteen ideas some of them are throw out there I'm not going to even bother but uh they uh\nThey say well here's one unpopular\nHow about we just cut benefits across the board right now he's a according to a a twenty sixteen trustees report benefits could be cut by as much as Twenty one percent and twenty thirty four in order to keep Social Security solvent through twenty nine he so that means right about the time you would need it\nA little later oh a little you'd need a little later than that but bottom\nLine before you even got the retirement age you'd be could be expecting Twenty one percent less if we don't do something pretty quick here\nI I don't even I don't even think about Social Security when it comes to my saving for future claiming her retirement I think that's part of the problem people use this as their only um that I understand some people that that's all they have they think it's just going to take\nCare of them forever and it's not going to be there it's it's ... it's a transfer of wealth for one Generation Next and the thing was older generations you know God Bless them they've been living off of Social Security some of them for Twenty years now\nYeah I Know what was meant to do and if you're a politician and you say I'm going to flip\nSocial Security on it had come on and vote for me\nNever going to happen so where where eventually does the next generation kick it down the line so when when when I'm going to get Social Security I have to kick it down the road even further and the thing is it snowballs down the road\nWhat was going to happen when it blows up\nOh absolutely no I think it would be a it would be a a terrible national tragedy when and if that day comes because as I don't know if you've heard the ah the statistics are read where you have a forty three percent of older single people this is their only\nMeans of supporting themselves that in itself is kind of scary so it means that they didn't have savings weighed and of course pensions are almost nonexistent now so what do you do\nUm but it got less everybody who has a pension out there but thank you and me I've got to the ... the single ... the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life really hurt me and I'll take care of you the rest of your life\nWell no it it's a bit that we're not talk about the way and that's another one of those socialistic ideas where most of the countries in Europe there the ... the federal government their pension for them or they\nUm that guess what you get old and things happen now particularly\nYou got it in the middle of the opioid epidemic maybe you so you have you did everything right but you got a kid who's going in and out of rehab all the time and or or you get sick or whatever so for all your best laid plans you end up broke and old maybe too old to work\nThen what ... uh I Would be nice to know that\nAfter all those years of working your job did your job or your government did provide something I don't think it's stupid I mean I'm drawing a pension right now but I gave thirty one years of my life doing a very hard job and then ...\nYou know you did in heart John everybody did a hard job that that that that's work that's what you do you trade your time for money\nWell yes but some jobs are are physically more demanding than others and I think that and then\nYou should get compensated more for your more physically demanding job you should look on the NFL you run into somebody with your head you get paid a lot more but you also agreed to do that job\nI'm just saying there needs to be more and and goes back to the social Social Security issue I'm not talking about socialism capitalism Trump Trump Republican Democrat anything I could go on forever out that it comes to just personal responsibility\nAbout everything I every thing you know and here's the other thing here's what's great about everything you can also at in our day and age go out and buy a life insurance policy disability policy if you're healthy and you get it when you're young you can have it the rest of your\nLife ... ... ... and I I I I admire that and I'm not trying to talk like hey that sounds good young ... you know about what I'm saying is\nIn reality sometimes life happens you sound like another caller I have ...
