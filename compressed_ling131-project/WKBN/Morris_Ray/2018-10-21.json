creating these noxious gas is in a rebel and you know people that or meat eaters basically when you talk to them because you can smell it on your breath and basically out their pores\nIt's cool stuff wolves come back next week every Sunday on they have more information thank you Jan so much for coming in to I Hope we encourage some people to move this direction that the next week folks Dr David ... go have a great\nWeekend [noise]\nInterests\nCan be deterring fine hardwood since Nineteen [laughter]\nFired from Michelle\nGroup of migrants making headlines heading from Honduras through Mexico on the move this morning ABC's Matt ... is traveling with the caravan now estimated at five thousand people\nUm but the important thing that we want to point out here is that even though the state it update this this list of a new counties you include more urban areas\nWhich doesn't mitigate some of the race was ... we saw in the original or the fact of the matter is that no uh no policy was changed here there's simply no following that criteria of\nUnemployment relatives national average and we know that a ... year to year and often times the city themselves like Cleveland or Youngstown or Toledo\nA municipal areas have higher unemployment than their surrounding counties and cities are always going to have\nRelatively high unemployment question is whether the count as a whole will and that was up in the air and we don't know this update will last longer than one year\nAnd to be clear what are the the the thing we're talking about here when you mentioned the county's is that I assume that in some of some other states perhaps they are going by uh\nThese as opposed to counties\nI Believe that at least possible I'm not that familiar with outside of a high okay\nOh you that the federal law simply as a second\nWave their war who harm and in areas of high unemployment it doesn't specify counties or cities now we believe it would certainly be possible for this waiver to be issued as a municipal level which will be more inclusive of urban areas that we don't have high unemployment\nAnd of course historically a urban areas or blacks tend to migrate toward urban areas so you know as you said this is not a you know I brought up the race issue but the simple fact is a typically there are more white people living in rural areas as opposed to black people so but\nUh so let's talk about the up by the way in the original how ... ... ... would you have nowhere Mahoney\nCounty or Trumbull county that's where I Am us where we are here and I wish I had a you know I spoke to earlier this week I Wish I'd brought that up but also were they\nWork exempt or ... or the um ... or be ... or the exemptions in place or not in place for these areas as far as you know\nThat works in the way to get out as the work requirement is was wave nationwide after the great recession and two thousand eight just because of the widespread\nHardship unemployment and then that the requirement was put back in place and wanting fourteen but states were allowed to wave at an area that we're still struggling\nOriginally Youngstown and ... did not make that exempt less but they ended up getting included I think last year and twenty Seventeen and they're selling quit it now and one thing I just want to say is nothing that I wrote about in this report and we've been pointing to on our our advocacy message\nHere nothing to say that these parts of the state aren't struggling and we know that jobs are hard to come by and the more rural Appalachian counties a and certainly in places like Youngstown hungry in Trumbull\nThe other counties on the eastern Appalachian part of the state we know that unemployment is a real problem there I certainly don't want to get the impression that these places aren't deserving of this exemption we just want to also point out that\nAh you know it's the fairness issue and we know the unemployment is is also a problem in these urban areas especially among minorities\nAnd by the way I mean a Youngstown as one of the highest unemployment\nRates in the state they remain so so ah but you know as we said as you said there's been some changes very recently uh specifically what a there been some counties added to the list\nThat's correct or about wealthiest counties or added to the last I and as the two\nBig ones that we think at least make the most difference in terms of racial disparities are Cuyahoga and Lucas counties because those are two big urban counties where are our high a much higher concentration of people of color let him\nWell you know I I just wonder and by the way uh what is the center for community solutions\nGlad you asked we are a completely nonpartisan and nonprofit a research and advocacy group focused on a improving health and economic conditions throughout the state of Ohio\nOr glad to hear that because I think those things need to be addressed um\nYou know when you you were talking earlier about the rural areas I I Know I don't I\nDon't get out as much as I'd like to but I was like you know that this is not a knock on Salem but I was down in Salem witches definitely seems to be the ... the downtown area I can see they're they're on the rebound now but I couldn't you know I rolled around a little bit got out in the sticks a little bit and then it you know it is\nThere are some people who are hurting down there so uh as you said you can't you can't dispute the fact that uh there's high unemployment not only in the urban areas but certainly in urban areas as well\nBut how so uh what would you like to see changed in the way that this has handled by the state if anything\nYou know like I touched on before I think the biggest change which had made is to see these exemptions granted at the municipal level\nOr after the news came out at Cuyahoga Lucas counties and some of those others were now include the accent and the exempt group I wanted to look at some of the data to see just how close those counties worked for the cut off and when I found was last year Cuyahoga missed out on and included in that exempt group\nBy about two percentage point their unemployment rate was about a hundred and Eighteen percent of the national average whereas the threshold was a hundred and twenty percent for the county just barely missed out but if you look at the city of Cleveland compared to the county as a whole they're always going to have\nAt least historically have had much higher unemployment and if it were granted at the municipal level\nOr the city itself would be pretty safely exempt from the word require a ... year after year so we do think that if if the state could change the criteria to uh be more inclusive of specific municipalities that could make a huge difference\nIn terms of racial disparities 'cause we don't know places like Cleveland or ... you know or maybe even Youngstown will continue being exams after this fiscal year year from now\nWould you when you you know when we talk about work work requirements what ... are there are there are certain amount of hours as far as you know that people are required to work to a earned these benefits\nYes it's about it's eighty hours a month or twenty hours a week I and it's not just you know a job there's a you can participate in certain training or education activities to count towards the work requirement\nAnd do I mean how what what is what happens if you don't comply I mean what happens is a saw that just automatically you lose your benefits or you don't you you don't qualify if you refused to uh get out there and work\nSo I Want to clarify that it's only applies to that able bodied adults without dependents childless adults for the most part um but I Believe the rule is if you're not working you can only receive your food stamp benefits or a three month period\nOr with and a large a three year period so if you're not employed even receive food stamps for three months and then you're cut off until three years later\nWhen we're talking about now able bodied single people that would include I suppose single parents\nOr no not quite as a without dependents\nSo how did you say that I'm so sorry okay after\nAn hour and I say I said uh parents are generally not included a but the other thing that I Want to talk about is I'm\nPart of the reason we think the issue is especially important right now is because of the state is waiting to hear on a a a similar proposals they're they're putting in place for work requiring work all crime into Medicaid\nUm so we're waiting for federal approval on whether or not the same mental man work requirements and the Medicaid program a which was ... very similar exemptions a on a county by county basis um and that when actually kind of parents in addition to those without children\nYou know and I know some people were just you know this is just my opinion I just think this country is becoming increasingly\nI I don't know if it's the right word but I'll say stingy a a less empathetic it seems it seems like everybody thinks you know here we're the richest country on the face of the earth and I hear people complaining that this country dares to take care of the less fortunate among us and I\nI don't I just don't know ... when that started it but it seems like it's certainly you had a fever pitch compared to recent years and go ahead\nYeah and without getting too political there certainly is a broader movement around the idea of her or possibility a and you know that people should have to work through Caesar public\nBenefits and nothing that we play out in this report is is that despite the fact that you know work is important in a good thing we know that work is hugely important towards uh lifting people out of poverty um and you know creating self sustainability um but the other thing that we want to be sympathetic I've been aware of\nIs the fact that it's a lot harder for people to work if there are struggling to put food on the table and the first place or a struggling to stay healthy and we know there's research\nI Seventy W.

Steve this is an ad put out by at\nLeast sympathizers to this congressman so what I'm saying is let's let's not make it sound like it's just the Democrats that's my only point because in their ... and when you have the president of the United states saying that Democrats are all for this\nUh this group of people that are coming up from South of the border and they won't open borders I don't see or you know your friends and neighbors are Democrats have you talked to them that they won't open borders I think is very disingenuous when he says that and he's playing his own version of identity politics\nAll right well first I got a couple of voice unpack on that one first and foremost um\nAgain that's a super PAC man it's not it's not the cars and doesn't doesn't support it but either way this or add\nIt actually ... the of what the Democratic Party was doing against justice Kavanaugh and it it kind of puts it back into a different perspective on how the how things can happen if you allow a uncorroborated accusation that literally has nothing to back it\nUp wait a minute but let's look at some of the words in that ... no matter who's behind it I mean lynching\nA all white girl a call ... would come on man that how can you justify that\nI'm not just ... I'm not justifying the at the at disgusting but I what I Am saying is it all it does show you the shows you the possibilities if you're going to support um support\nWell I you know you can say what you will there by the way part or reason oh there's a lot of people out there working two or three jobs because it would be that you would you admit that there are people working two or three jobs not just because they like it because they have to because that's because maybe the job they're working doesn't pay nearly as good as they did they\nShould because they choose because they choose a horrible job they don't they're not because they can't pass the drug test so they have to be they have to be a bartender and a\nAnd a server at three different places okay you you find somebody if you go they don't want to work hard at a factory they don't want that and the ... or better yet ... they they don't have the ability to take care of that child because you know they they have a child they can't take care of because they they practice ears are unsafe sex\nWell well great you know you got you got it all this now you got it all figured out unless I Know that's probably the black community\nI Know there's a problem in the black community I Know it's all no problem in the white community as well now more so so you know but like I said ... percent\nBlack man like forty percent why it's forty percent Hispanic so it's like twenty percent of the Asian community um so\nWe have in this country is people don't know people need a closer legs okay well thank you ... to start taking care of themselves\nBanks banks thank you very much Steven and as usual all the answers to society's problems in a nutshell thank you very much\nBut of course life is a little more complex than that\nLet's move on to the next caller you know I'm not I'm not excusing any behavior but\nSometimes you have to deal with reality and it's sometimes it's not as simple as keeping your legs close I mean I'm all for that believe me like a a as my drill sergeant used to say when you whip it out with it all and so uh that's where the rubber meets the road you should be responsible okay\nBut let's go to a manual he's in Warren go ahead Emanuel\nHow're you doing more might have about ready to explode on you that I think\nProbably the majority of black Americans heads are ready to explode and the majority of fair minded white people but go ahead\nCan we talk about something besides Donald Trump\nOkay go forward\nA first of all it was the first thing I Want to thank you you know\nI'll listen to you when you talk about the social thing you know because I'm I'm One of those terrible a single parents you know make babies when I'm by myself of course my wife died of cancer\nWith oh I'm sure he can have an answer for that too but go ahead [laughter]\nI hear your regular place and I go to restaurant I'll go there and everything you said about that is true and I go lie and I say I heard about it for you and ... and please don't ever stop you know\nBecause we count on you you know a social butterfly please don't stop to that was a great places to go to see is like it was nice and warm to\nOkay well I'm Glad and and and I guess I'm not sure if they're still advertising maybe they should start again because apparently got the uh my recommendation is worth something but anyway um\nLet me get your story real quick and go ahead sir\nI was oh my my my my older sister and my aunt that everybody was going down and and my daddy was happy and and he took it all out to eat\nYou know and when that we often as he reached in his pocket and he pulled out of ... the money right and I see and I didn't get my one sister a couple of thousand dollars\nThey gave my other sister about whether to sort of like Fifteen hundred dollars they only gave my two sisters my you know my my ... he gave them about seven months ago on the beach\nThey make the money down to pay for the bill then they looked at me even when he told me\nIf they want you looking at boy he wrote that money up and he put that back in his pocket but this was like Thirty years ago and this is Bob in eastern stand right I found out not too long ago my sister my sister my sister went to my daddy after that my daddy you should that boy like that you know\n...\nYou know my dad he told them what's up\nHe says that he found because there was just me I have no kids ... he said when you ... you have to feed your kids first so if you're single I mean if you're a single body or do you should be able to go to the job site both forty hours you don't get paid\nNo I'm saying no and I don't have a problem with that and by the way I don't totally disagree with some things the previous caller said\nAbout all I'm saying is I think sometimes people oversimplify it and and\nYes there are people out there making bad decisions in fact I've got a situation in my own family right now where I have a niece that is\nI'm really concerned about where she's headed and so you know and she was raised you know the whole you know soccer mom private schools all that but she's making some very bad choices and being involved with some very bad people\nAnd um so I Do understand that those things happen but as I said do you agree with what I said with my guest I was talking to her earlier do you you just sense that America has become\nMeaner angrier ...\nWell I I really didn't want to go down this road right but I think they're becoming neither and angrier and stage here to a certain segment of the population now there's some people in it and and this and in his community\nIn America they're having a great time you know they're they're getting help getting money hand over foot\nBut by the way I let's say let me take this break by the way that was the point of having my gas where even though it wasn't intentionally by race you had some ... some people had to work for the snap benefits and others who were exist\nAnd coincidentally it did break down along racial lines but this was because of rural versus urban but we'll talk about that and more on the other side with Emanuel all news radio five Seventy

K. yeah ... and I'll get that out the other side of talk radio thanks for being with us and let's go back and let a Emanuel finishes point go ahead Emanuel\nOkay well what I'm saying is is I Want you to know how big of a ... you have on people around here because you're one of the reasons why I'm On Twitter now I'm not on Facebook Twitter now\nJust stay on sweater trust me Facebook is so ugly and you know\nI mean you're on Twitter and I find out who you are I mean where are you I'm going Twitter I work for\nJust ... A M O R e y ... and I'll tell anybody who wants to send me hate tweets that you only get one shot so anyway because you know what I'm saying\nAnd I said at the top of it but my two daughters right or a came in the great game oldest went to a sleep over last night and my youngest just came back what you're talking and I got to make some girl she can get back the next Sunday\nBut you know [laughter]\nYou got the last time you did the same thing\nWhy not\nUse yes you should probably since you got to do the same damn thing you just finally find me in front of my classes get the hell out of here\nAnd there we have a there we have a while he was candidate than a Greg gee in forte who the president thought did a great thing by body slamming this reporter\nSo like I said the one hand he's staring at the camera and his little propaganda video talking about how nutty the Democrats are and yet you have a sitting president of United States condoning this behavior from a fellow Republican\nMy my we certainly live in interesting times let's take some calls a ... percent growth city hello Steve\n... good morning to your mouth Yes sir\nFirst off our prayers to you and your family or Germany science Sunday dairy may and uh and all I Want to say I know it's not an easy thing every day to deal with so\nMuch we may disagree but\nFamily is always\nFirst Yes sir I thank you for that\nNow back with a disagreement far 'cause that's the fun part you know mhm hey we're usually get angry and we we get yelled each other 'cause we pack I get tired of these people that bitch and moan about everything but you have coming who your representative or even their school board representative while I don't know\nWell all the way I can I say I totally agree with that and and I'm even going to say I even want us\nYou know I'm going to ask everybody maybe not so much up might started today but are you voting have you voted which I have voted by the way but I don't like those are the worst\nOf the worst because more people didn't vote and vote at this last election wasn't decided by the voters it was a side it by the non voters so if you don't even know you represent as if you leave and do your homework please don't call this show and mouth your bill ...\n... when you won't even participate in the system\nLike I don't believe in the early voting like it is but that's that's all right we're lauded disagree I Want to really ought to be passionate and disagree as long as we'll have a beer and a shot of whiskey together and put her go to bed angry if you understand my main one\nNotch you certainly have\nYou certainly have good taste and beverages I Will say\nBut I'm sure everyone all the way my friend [laughter]\nI'm a I'm a I'm a bourbon guy and I'm I I'm actually a Woodford Reserve a little pricey but man but anyway another plug hey I wanted\nTo go along with them but you know here on one thing to do bothered me I mean we all know the immigration thing is broken and there's a lot of different facts like\nIllegal aliens whatever you want to call them they come every day for ... years was twenty first century slavery you know 'cause nobody else when nobody wants the companies don't want to pay big money and people at the stores don't want to pay big money for tomatoes\nAnd that'll either way that's why even the U.S chamber of commerce is against some of the president's immigration policies because they see this as a hurting some of their businesses and uh and some people are concerned about higher prices\nBut I Would ask you and by the way it's not always a wage thing because I just saw an interview with an avocado farmer in California who's paying almost twenty dollars an hour and he can't get Americans to do this job\nBut you know what I'm going to say and and here I Am now Donald Trump ... public can support them in Ninety five percent of the time so we'll get that out but what I'm going to say is like the strength of turning up\nThere are certainly nothing wrong with a box because the sun supposed to decide who gets the you know either you know how the Congress was made up its American citizen vote people that can vote should be ...\nAnd I mean we could still travel in America but there was nothing wrong with a check for bark or are you a citizen of the United states\nOh by the way I agree and I think it's a non issue because ... particularly under this administration if I wasn't a citizen I wouldn't be checking anything so [laughter] I mean what I\nMean as I wrote that argument and you know I Know that travel forty at once everybody to be represented in our town so they can get there for ... you know the United States Constitution voting is for the United states a lot\nThat we get our water they come up and deport we're doing right or wrong I Want you to get into that because I think the politicians like to use that so they don't get real stuff done\nYou're doing just a little bit\nBut you know I have a problem nor can being given for free but insulin for people that might need it in his arm like twice\nYeah I've seen that long ago someone get free you're going to be responsible for the crime you commit\nA uh yeah but so do you say do you let them die if they can't pay for it I'm trying to understand me you know what I mean\nI I just I noticed one like again and we were talking earlier six seven times that I'm On something needs to be done ... don't don't put them back on the street from but I mean that's an old ever another argument yeah back to the body slamming\nYeah because I Want to ask you how\nHow old you know let me ask you this because this is what guy by the way I Am just last night I Believe Mitch McConnell is confronted by or what might have been friday night by a it was three or four people Holly sat in a restaurant I don't condone this okay and I don't like it when the president talks about angry mob it listen please don't paint me\nThe whole Democratic Party because the actions of a few crazies any more than ever Republican is a neo Nazi because of what happened in Charlottesville I just like the president should be more responsible in his comments can we agree on that\nMost definitely and the most racist\nI Am an award racist racist rings overused words people use the word shouldn't be using the word needs to use its dogs get yours most one of the most hateful person in politics is Donald Trump\nAs an old story with that preserve greeted Maxine Waters needs to tone down and walk oh\nAbsolutely and by the way are seeing this was the unintended consequences I go back and forth with fellow or people who tend to vote for Democrats or liberals because they are\nNow I'm intrigued to sit down with Joe leading to talking about his new album Egypt and of course some discussion about a little band called the lead off we were piece when we were playing music I her radio present inside the city yeah check it out now\nWas destroyed officers arrived at the scene of a shooting on friday night to be met by upset by standards and an uncooperative victim and when they arrived they found a man on the ground\nShot in the leg they describe him in the police report as uncooperative and having unreasonable behavior the officers say they overheard some bystanders they said the man was having a conversation with another man before the shooting they also set a car was moved before the officers arrived the victim was taken to the hospital by ambulance\nHundreds of people came together in Youngstown on Saturday for food giveaways across the city they said the give away was held to provide a healthy options to some residents who don't have a nearby grocery store from the power show really Buick GMC of cow cut out Ohio newsroom\nI'm Jake capital pseudo our next update at twelve just ahead more stimulating talk from the old Charlie's digital studios nine Ninety nine menu nine great meals one great price oh Charlie's\nForward and John ... dot com where price sells cars and great service each customer [noise]\nOkay\nWell come back and ah oh yeah that Bush\nAnd machine had they were in town recently anyway former ex saw led by like ... ex husband of Gwen still funny anyway our number here three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven and to the last caller's comment\nI Will say is someone I've already voted by the way and I don't know why he disagrees with early voting I think that's another thing we can talk about I think ah have been two states in particular a Kansas and\nGeorgia there's obvious disenfranchisement of voters going on and I hope that they'll take these people to court because it's ridiculous\nKris Kobach a cold call back in the Kansas a leading up a women's Republican group is voting for the Democratic candidate because they think this guy's so out there in the way he's handling his campaign and in a case of ah\nIn the case of Georgia you got the guy who's sitting the attorney general who is running for governor the Republican and he's running against Tracy Abrams a who was attempting to become the first black female governor of Georgia will infer in fact the first black female governor in the United states and its neck and neck right now\nBut it's come to light that uh they have a very strict law in Georgia it's called the a perfect match law in some cases if you had a name that was hyphenated like if your name was of a K C O Cortez for example just pulled out one out and uh and there was a high in there\nIf if there was no high for known your registration I mean it's the same name but they're that they're being that strict and\nA ironically almost all most a million people have been kicked off the rolls and disproportionately these people are black\nAnd you gotta wonder what's going on there and I do expect a court challenge but also as far as what he was talking about what the Democrats in their possibilities in for twenty twenty I'm not looking that far what I'm hoping for is that and he only hear me using the term blue way because I think\nThe possibility of a blue wave had been certainly hindered by the Kavanaugh\nHearings and the way the some of that was handled by Democrats I think that hurt Democrats and I think it it it definitely\nFired up the Republican base but I Do believe that the Democrats still have a good shot for taking back\nThe house and if they take back the house this president who refuses to compromise will have to compromise because it's not just a matter of you know the caller was talking about well he doesn't have to worry about California New York well I'm a I'm Sorry\nYes he does he is the president of the United states not just the president of the Republican states so\nHopefully if there is more balance\nOr he will have to act accordingly but let's go back to your calls and I apologize to the folks that way that the longest then I see who's way that the longest is Brian in Charlottesville and call somebody dropped off there and I don't blame them but let's talk to Brian in Charlottesville hello Brian\nMorris our pretty good sir that's good\nUm I Want to get a quick all ... out of the way real quick um um what you'd call a ... or a Democrat or a blue dog Democrat whatever you want\nA blue dog Democrat or yeah or did you say a Reagan Democrats out you're probably that if you are you saying you're a Democrat who voted for Trump is that what you're getting that\nOh no I didn't vote for Trump I voted for Gary Johnson\nRespectfully but I got I I don't get you guys but You're welcome to vote for whoever you want to but I you know there's one state where all the people who voted for Jill Stein voted for Hillary Clinton we might not have a President Trump right now I just don't understand is great the vote your\nConscience but uh personally I\nDidn't I didn't like Hillary and I didn't like Donald Trump\nSo you chose to be a spoiler [laughter] whoa\nI guess but that's not why call okay I call because I just got out of Massmart\nAn hour ago and\nThe priest actually for each ... after the guards actually reached we need to get along better mhm\nWe do I mean if you and I went and had a\nOf bar Britain's [laughter] you know what I mean we'd have a good time as long as we didn't talk all of\nA yes or our great Ron verbal all the time either that's why I listen to your show because I I like but you have to say\nWell appreciate the well and and and and that's the only thing I'm I'm\nWay the country just have to quit being so well like you said earlier angry I guess\nWell I don't see that changing anytime soon so that's the problem I don't see you know hopefully\n... after the midterms ah maybe some of this will settle down and I know I'm not blaming him exclusively but I think the president sets the tone and ... and when you have the president of the United states accusing a whole party of being the party of\nA of a a you know being an angry mob meal mobs\nMean jobs not mobs there's a catchy slogan but I think it's offensive because not every Democrat is angry not every Democrat is a mob and as I said before any more than every\nRepublican is carrying a torch and as supporting what's going on what went on that Charlottesville it's ridiculous it's untrue it's irresponsible and it's on presidential\n... exactly and and you know what I Do not agree with it too far and I don't agree with you All right\nAre going to forget it they're going to turn a page and if I'm a fellow Democrat what is our platform where we were with our goals what are we trying to change here is a fellow Democrat I mean what are we ... what do we know or against\nOr against war against everything that Trump's stance for and he he he's he's promoting he's promoting locked doors and sensors and borders and and keep in America\nAnd he wants he wants to keep it short on there to make sure that we don't have absolutely crazy people come across the board\nListen but by the way up you know remember at one point they call ... Obama the reporter and chief there if you look for him twice okay but I just want to say if you look at the numbers there was a lot of deportation under Barack Obama as well although then at the same time as a bone he he came up with his DACA fix which\nUp what the Democrats want the we we want a humane\nImmigration policy not this year\nAnd letting people jumped right over people who have waited ... done the right thing to come across\nNo not at all no no but if you let me tell you what I'm saying if that if you tell me what I'm saying maybe you'd understand what I'm saying yeah well let me put you on hold a news they're going to the music playing that means we need to take a break I'll come back to that caller and tell them what I'm trying to say well\nYou'll be\nAnd uh before I go back to the caller I'll just say of and I will let him make his points\nI'll just say here's what I think Democrats are for I think I I as I said and I'll be talking about on the other side of the break I think we need to make voting more accessible yes have checked to make sure everything is is is is on the straight narrow\nSo I'm for that because of the voting rights and the voting rights act was uh was definitely watered down a few years ago by the Supreme Court\nAnd and there are ... there are tons of cases if you look around the country where Republicans are making it harder to vote I don't think that's I think all citizens and I get I specify citizens\nHope that they're like I said you just saw I mean in a in Kansas where big group of Republican women are saying they're voting for Democrats because they think the Republican Party has gotten too extreme so everybody\nCan't you know and every I don't believe in every far left idea I hear I think there's guaranteed income thing is ridiculous you know you work you don't you nobody is giving you anything I I agree with that all I'm saying is though\nI Want to see some balance here because I think you have a guy who I don't think much of it was a human being and I think if you if you embolden him by giving him a a fully compliant Congress that will give them everything he wants I just think that's potentially dangerous\nI Want to see some balance on I Hope that balance comes in the mid term if not guess what is your America you're going to have it your way for at least the next six to eight years because I as I said earlier I don't see a strong Democrat right now maybe there's somebody I don't see but I don't see them\nOr we don't we weren't we don't want to be associated with Kavanaugh we don't want to be associated with with our behavior that we've than just spraying for the last couple of years\nAnd I haven't you know I don't much care for jumped either we just people to clowns to ground zero for you were talking earlier about knowing who your representative is you know I Know who my representative is it's Tim right you know why he's been there forever\nYou know what I could think that he's done not from\nWell that's what some people say thank you for your time bank you\nKnow and I but I voted for I'll tell you right now I said my votes were total protests votes I have been very clear where I stand I don't try to\nCandy coated or try to pretend I'm a you know I'm I Try to be fair as I said last week I had both Tim Ryan and his opponent on well I think it's a fine man seriously I've talked to this man\nI think Chris depizzo is a good man but I voted for Tim Ryan and all the other Democrats because I Want something to push back against this president who I don't agree with and the\nWay he he uh comports themself and in in some in the way he attacks his fellow Americans simply because they disagree with him or because they have a deep behind their name that's not how you do what other presidents yes\nObama took gentle jabs at Republicans yes I get it but he didn't call them evil I was so impressed by a quote by Nikki Haley which I'll Try to find before one o'clock where she basically said guess what just because you're on the other part of your not our enemy when you listen to the venom that Donald Trump's views\nThis is not presidential this is not reaching out across the aisle this is saying\nYou're either with me or against me and if you're against me I'm going to make your life miserable I'm going to paint the whole party as a mob because of the actions of a few people regarding the Kavanaugh matter which I have\nSaid was all the some of the the way some of the congressman harm me some of the senators handled themselves and certainly the way from the crowds have handled themselves I'm not for it I don't agree with it\nBut I just think it's really\nIt's a flat out lie just say all Democrats on open borders all Democrats are part of an angry mob that's just crazy talk and I think we're better than that that's all I'm saying let's see who's up next looks like I'm going to Tony in feral hello Tony\nYes um I voted for President Trump and I also voted for President Obama and I like to ask you today what was better under President Obama that is better than under President Trump\nWell for one thing some of the things I just mentioned the did I did not see the name calling I didn't see all this this juvenile behavior from President Obama or any president previous as far as I'm concerned\nI thought the uh the economy no it wasn't where it is now but you know we were on the age ... on the edge of a global economic collapse would you not agree\nI Believe that show and I I Believe that was\nPart of the cause of that that recession we were in was when the Democrats took control the house I Know investors would pull back and I take a wait and see look because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to be president\nAnd they wait a minute wait wait wait let's let's keep it at less get our ... a crime or let's get our\nChronology right or the the great recession happened in two thousand eight two thousand nine Hillary Clinton yeah she was thinking about running you're right but she\nYou know block Obama was the president you had you had candidate McCain on the right and then candidate Obama on the left who are called to the White House by President George W. Bush because they ... they he was trying to tell them this is serious folks\nAnd I don't know that I can blame it all on the Democrats will cause a prior to that the ... you had a Republican president and a largely Republican Congress for ... for at least six oh well almost the whole eight years of the most\nBiting my feeling for this okay in two thousand six the Democrats took control the house Nancy Pelosi became speaker that's correct\nOkay that's when investors\nAnd that's a little rude to put it that way but seriously for your peanut gallery let's put it that way\nMhm oh yeah some ... I don't remember what gr ... first one was but he said accused him of doing what you're doing a button and that's basically what chunk\nYeah I mean you know and there's a great article or the great article in New York Times this week about the creeping enables opinion piece not an article a op ed about a ... a compare in an era but also in the company video where they compare some of his tactics tactics\nOf Mussolini and Hitler not to say he's those people he hasn't put people in concentration camps and all that but the way he communicates his message the way he vilified the other side the way he turn things around\nI mean for when you have him saying that the Democrats are trying to do this horse destroy Social Security and Medicare\nWhen the Republican from the inception of those programs never care for them that's why Everytime I hear that bill Johnson commercial on a ... ... because you got Mitch McConnell basically blaming all our economic problems on those\nSo called entitlements\nWhen they don't you know when Ronald Reagan even said that that's a whole separate issue but they're trying to tell you so basically if they win if they if they hold the house and the Senate and I'm Ari emboldened by this\nWill be coming after benefits there will be some modifications and and it's just ... but for the president to try to turn it around completely oh no no Republican Party which has time and time again going after these benefits they're not going after your benefits the Democrats are trying to destroy it it's it's unbelievable\nHello Misha ... said that he was going to do so ground and I believe he will [noise]\n[laughter] yeah so that's one thing I Believe you can trust him on\nWe'll see what happens I got to move on but I thank you for your call thanks for being the only lady today [laughter] thank you thank you Lisa All right we're back after the bottom of the hour break and we'll try to get to all the calls and ... all news radio five Seventy WKBD and [noise]\nThings from the farm\nDarn I should've called Dana called ... drains Dana uses the latest and drain in Seward meaning technology so he understands the process Dana Morris has been providing award winning service to the tri county area for over forty years honest knowledgeable dependable and affordable offering you peace of mind on the Web Dana's dream\nDone Tom find this on Facebook or call five four zero Dana Dana's drain woman aiding dream drama\nSunny summers when he first what's new today on the ...

dot com selling America's Best selling brand\n[noise]\nAnd all\nBreaking Benjamin and so cold that's the kind of recurring theme today I just think America has become so cold when it comes to so many\nThings whether it be the issue of immigration whether it be helping the less fortunate among us but uh hey this is who we are and as I've said before this uh the mid term elections and the next Twenty one twenty two days\nThis will be a defining moment in America this will tell me which America I live in I've said many times before on election night uh twenty sixteen I said that I don't know my country any more we'll see I mean if if\nGives the president on okay and says we liked the way things are going to by the way I understand some good things are happening but if we can down the way this man\nBut have we condone the nastiness\nAnd the and the name calling and all that and we just think that's just fine then I'll know that I don't I really don't know my country anymore\nThe polls are indicating that there may be some changes that there may be a a there maybe some people out there with an appetite for checks and balances so we'll see what happens but let's quickly go through these calls and if you've held a long time please forgive me but up next is a\nA Kurt in Akron who is held a ridiculously long time hello occurred\nHey thanks for letting me hold for two hours and two minutes\nOr a dog but I didn't do it on purpose I Know you\nDid your hat on your hat or very stimulating conversation with people today so anyway the one caller said you know I was always raised to respect the office not necessarily the man but respect the office well it's hard to respect the office when the man who's holding that office doesn't respect that office\nWell many I've heard many people say that too and then\nYou know as you as I pointed out you know when you talk about acting presidential how many times have you heard him mocked the notion of acting presidential as though\nThat some type of insult if something were just saying hey you're Seventy two year old man why don't you act like an adult you're a businessman I don't think there is this the way you conduct your business or the silly tweets that everybody in the world can see this is not you know I Love these people who say but that's just his opinion now I'm afraid now I don't\nKnow that's actually that's actually policy that's actual you know that's the national interest but what and I hate to tell this to Trump is who think it's just his opinion yeah maybe his opinion but you know what when the president says it those words matter\nOh absolutely and you know so I hear that time and time again and I just roll my eyes shake my head or whatever because I'm thinking no he's not just Joe blow he's the president and so when he says something asinine it's a reflection on this whole country\nAbsolutely and you know the other point that was made 'cause I had enough time to listen to the entire show today I normally\nDon't get to ... my wife has other things for me to do now she's out of town but anyway I found one\nGentleman said you know he doesn't have to worry about California and New York state and all that stuff\nYou know this is the president this is the United states of America and the last I read the president is the president of all the people not just a thirty four percent minority of people that speak the loudest and play the heart is right\nYou know it and you know if that's the way of thinking for the conservatives you know what Neal Armstrong that was not an American achievement then for a man to walk on the moon that was Ohio's achievement for man walking on the phone\nI'm you know we can go down the list of various people from various different states rather than say that's a national achievement let's just say it's a certain state achievement right that's what separates that's what separates us from other countries look at Europe every little country\nIs the equivalent of what our state is you know that's that's what makes us great that's what makes us unique regardless of who the president of the United states\nWell yeah and I and I'll admit that you know every president tends to of course play for his\nHis uh his constituency if you will but I Do believe that this president basically saying hey if you don't like me screw you basically and\nAnd that that might be an elegant way of putting it but I Know what he shows when he stands there and his little pep rallies and he he takes jabs at people in in this state or that state\nFor what it this way fifty six years ago this week\nWe were on the brink of nuclear war All right with the Russians pointing missiles at us from Cuba what would have happened if Jack Kennedy would have said okay it's okay if you point those missiles at the state of Ohio because they didn't vote for me in Nineteen sixty but don't point them at Massachusetts because you know that they they voted for me there and\nDon't wait a minute access and don't point them at this theater that state and I would [noise] you know\nI Know I Know I mean you know and this is what drives me nuts all the flag waving\nPatriots they don't seem to have a problem with a president who is mainly only speaking to forty one percent of the country that's his most recent poll number then that's\nYou know and and there are so these people and I and and you can believe whatever you want to believe folks I if you if you love everything the man does one thing that I don't uh that I hear people say and I've I've talked about myself\nThat they act like his achievements are somehow any race or for any agree just behavior and I think that's the other\nThing I Want to say about his quote unquote achievements what the hell is done nothing he's been writing on the back of Obama's economic recovery since two thousand ten\nWell I Can't say that completely I listen you gotta you gotta admit that there has been a major restructuring of our tax", "show_name": "Morris Ray", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "21"}
