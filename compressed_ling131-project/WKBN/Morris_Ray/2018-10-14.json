minutes so I'm Sorry we didn't get to the callers that we had I missed a couple of them and I I deeply apologize for that next time I'll make a little better effort I kept busy talking about what I Want to get across to people and the\nNext week will do more but look hate holidays are coming up fast folks\nAnd ... you know you'll have plenty of chances they have excuses not to eat health fully\nAnd so now's the time to get healthy put the effort into it and now we would you rather you know being an old slug sit on the couch snoring when everybody else's ... enjoying the camaraderie and the visiting\nYou know just because you've been overeating so long that your body the break or shut down when you eat that big meal and you just you know yet you don't have the energy to stay awake\nIf you start now and you add some vegetables to your meal every day and you cut back your calories and drop five pounds before the holidays jeez you know this is only mid October you could conceivably lose twenty pounds before Thanksgiving wouldn't that be phenomenal\nYou know and and don't do it just by starving yourself feed your body while you're losing weight here's the magical thing if you're burning off fat and you're taking in plenty of nutrients in fruits and vegetables and limited nuts and berries and things like that\nYour body will not only be freed up the burden of all the fat that it's holding and all the extra water that is holding which is very important to get rid of\nBut it will begin to thrive\nDeep from within the cells when each of your cells is freed up to work better because the capillaries you're delivering oxygen better and carrying the carbon dioxide away more efficiently\nMan you just won't believe what happens to how you feel it it's like the curtain is lifted and you you can see light again that's exactly how it feels\nAnd for some people it takes a little longer if you've been working on you know torturing your body for much longer period of time with the way you eat and you start to lift that burden\nYeah it'll take a little longer for some people but the results will be that much more amazing because you will realize the health that you've been missing\nSo the holidays are coming up you know this is a chance for you to apply what I'm saying plan ahead\nYou know this week tried to go one day without any meat it's not that hard really I Do this every day and I grew up eating meat you know meats cheeses those are the things that clogged up your body heavy heavy animal fats butter watch out for the butter and recipes it's hidden many times restaurants you so much butter and sugar in her recipes\nThat you don't even know it's there but you're drawn to keep going back to their food tastes so good and you don't realize why it's because of those hidden fats in hidden sugars in there\nAnd those are the things that make some of those recipes tastes so good even to people whose taste buds have been you know beaten down over the years with all these rich foods\nThe beauty of moving more toward a plant based diet is that over time you actually begin your taste buds are freed up all of a sudden for a while you'll go and this apple doesn't even taste that great and then pretty soon you're eating the apple you're go man that's Apple's so flavorful I was playing golf\nThe other day down at valley golfing Colombian and with a good friend of mine and I don't play golf much\nBut I'm trying to maybe get back into it and there was an apple tree up on the hill but several of them and I went and got an apple offers some of them had worms in them but it was the best tasting apple I ever had in my life\nNow if I just said all kind of fatty stuff that morning I wouldn't have noticed it let's go get healthy come back next Sunday and let's talk again thanks so much you have a great week [noise]\nFrom [noise]\n\nTime is ten o'clock Sean ... brothers can be deterring fine hardwood since Nineteen [laughter]\nFired from France\nYou know there certainly was a lot of focus but I think that Democrats are remembering more that hearing then Republicans um and I don't think it you know the wind Renee seat rational candidates I don't it doesn't seem to be translating I again I don't think anything for granted\nYou always run like you're behind that were running that way but that I think that that was kind of the day after everyone was saying that but I don't really sense that I'm right now\nI sense that our voters are more energized there's\nWell what about and I know you do want to focus on on on the state racism sides but what I think when the president of the United states\nCharacterizes the whole Democratic Party as being an angry mob because of the actions of a handful of people during these Kavanaugh proceedings\nYeah I mean I just look back at Charlottesville\nAnd and you know then he said what were those were some very fine people who are marching with those torches a woman was obviously scaled and then he calls people who were protesting a mob it it it's just more kind of\nTalk that doesn't make a lot of sense I'm not I again my view is\nIgnored that if I'm if I'm a candidate in Ohio right now I'm Talking about health care talking about this school problem that it's the talk of for profit charter school I'm Talking about the corruption\nA ... one mistake I think Democrats often make is to get into a a back and forth every day with whatever Trump is saying they're tweeting and I think that ... that he actually he's pretty good at dating us off topic we should follow through\nThat [noise] [noise] well speaking\nI'm joined by my for a two year old in the car so interruptions I followed that\nOh that's fine I mean there there you're going to raise their their future Democrats are well [laughter] um [laughter] but uh no okay so you just talked about the ... electronic classroom up tomorrow and a lot of people or it just seems to be flying under the radar for a lot of people\nIs a significant amount of money millions of dollars of taxpayer right taxpayer money that was squandered on this failed electronic class promotional out not to mention leaving a bunch of students tens of thousands of students in the lurch when the whole thing fell apart\nUm what was the are we talking six sixty three million dollars or more that we know how to do\nIt so it's the biggest scandal in the history of Ohio\nAnd it's basically a perfect symbol of the corruption of Columbus where they basically sold our schools that our kids to the highest bidder a major Republican donor basically came up with a ... rich quick schemes\nTaking money out of a public schools for his for profit online company and so it took up billion out of our schools all over the state every county but several hundred million basically went to went to pay for students at this school couldn't even prove attended\nUm but in the meantime our public schools that falls and fifth twenty second in the nation\nA but by the way that he is a Republican officeholders like Mike DeWine John ... who's he savor all these guys got money from this charter school founded ever did their job or cracking down on it ate Yost in fact who's now running for attorney general\nLiterally spoke at this school graduation three different times the irony is that at the highest bailout dropout rate in the country and um\nHe gave them awards an auditor have said awards for their bookkeeping so this thing as a as a symbol of the corruption in Columbus\nAnd I don't think it's important to the average voter right now is health care but it's certainly if people are worried about swamps in Columbus and ISI\nOr this E. cuts scandal is a perfect example of the of the swap of Columbus and that we have a chance to and that this November if you vote for Democrats for auditor attorney general state house that of\nCourse Richard Cordray Mike DeWine was attorney general through all of it he's received money from he caught he never lifted a finger tells about three months ago when clearly a poll showed him that he had a problem\nWell you know ... and having said all that so why then do you think the polls were so close and so many of these races they are people simply not aware of this or are they simply indifferent to what's going on\nI think the reason the polls are closed because of this you know in the terms we normally aren't close and that's the reality we have not we're glad Ohio for years and the last Twenty years and\nThe reason the polls are close is because I think people are seeing Columbus being what it is a they're sent him a nonstop attacks on I'm\nOn the health care if I could go like my line in the ... and the Columbus state house so we are giving we're getting a chance that we normally not yet because of this [noise]\nWell okay but the thing that amazes me about this is that it it does seem that do you think that uh you know in my case ah I was talking to someone of all ... I won't name names but I Will say one of my colleagues here at the radio station and and um they you know we were talking about how Democrats are overwhelmingly [noise]\nDominated I mean are\nThere over overwhelmingly out numbered in the assembly right almost what are we talking to two to one to one and\nThey they have they've had they've gerrymandered the heck out of the state and the other thing we can do this November is by electing Kathleen Clyde and sex base and that gerrymandering\nWell by the way did one of them didn't we recently passed something to say that uh that said that there'd be a committee to address this or what the ... yes\nWe did and so the ... that was a very good reform and it creates some guard rails and some rules that will make it harder gerrymander\nBut if you've watched what I've watched I still much rather be in control of the process where we don't if we're on the outside looking in and I'm Still a firm that will be what they've always done which has drawn the most aggressive maps they can\nOr can't believe it fair districts so if you lack more state house members Kathleen Clyde and ...\nWe will actually be able to ... to ... to search thousand I Know what are people who made the fair districts\nSo there are a form was good winning this November's even better or we can you know to this election has fourteen years of consequence if we were in those races\nOr we can actually end this your Mandarin which by the way it's not just a bad thing for Democrats it's bad for politics is bad for Ohio you know we have a right now I'm ... I'm impressed that you've got both people coming on your shows you know most parts of Ohio the Republicans won't even go to debates they will go to form\nA feeling titled or just walk back into the offices because the districts are drawn for them they don't even worry about getting reelected it's a terrible system and it's one reason Ohio is falling behind we don't have elected officials to feel at all accountable to the people\nWell the point I was going to earlier with the discussion I had with a colleague was you know here's the answer to everything is well since the Republicans are running everything we need to elect more Republicans in this particularly in the ... valley there's still a very blue area and I'm like well that's not the answer how about\nYou know how about holding this party accountable for some of the things they've done the malfeasance with he caught and\nUh the gerrymandering that you're speaking um other things instead of the answer is no let's just put more people own their team that I I bought that yeah\nThat one party rule if this happens on either side but one party rule is crushing Ohio right now and yeah we need a national crisis is the highest level of student debt in the country or were you know our our our economy has not recovered like most state\nWe've got a speaker who was captured out of the speakership a few months ago because he's being investigated for bribery extortion with payday lender a lobbyist\nBy the MCI let's not here to the\nEconomy is the biggest scandal ever one party rule and gerrymandering is\nIs actually meet leading terrible result the more balance you have in Columbus had better we're going to do\nAnd we're we're at a you know two thousand six was the last time you had this much scandal in one year and that's when we ... this year is far more than two thousand six economy is so much worse than coin gate ever was because it's affecting kids it's tax dollars leading\nHunting parenting taxpayers hands in going into it on account of for profit school\nSo that guy's a millionaire he's now gearing donations to all the Republican officeholders I mean if you can't hold on a terrible though after that I mean we're basically just say whatever you want we just don't care I actually think that people like Mike and wine and John Hughes date goes\nAfter ... ... it out they couldn't be extra biggest qualifying\nLong term from public service if you screw up the public or the state as badly as they have that it as far as I'm concerned it's time for new leadership and people who will you know call the whistle on this kinda stuff instead of giving them awards because you're more excited at your donor and your mad about the fact that they're ripping\nAll off so this is a year where\nFirefighter say they busted down the door to battle the flames and when they got upstairs the entire floor was charred they had declined to the roof to battle the flames\nThe home was badly damaged they say the bath tub\nFell through the second floor and some of the roof fell onto the car in the driveway five thirty say someone lives in the home but they have not released any names eyewitnesses told our news team a man who was burnt was taken out of the home by EMS you perform chest compressions on him before taking him to the hospital in arson investigator is investigating the fire\nOne man died during a stabbing that was reported in Iowa Saturday evening according to police the incident occurred around five pm on Warren avenue according to police one man died and a woman was tickets at the hospital after the incident they said another man was taken into custody\nNo one has been identified yet from the power Chevrolet Buick Jim sea of Cal ...

[noise]\nThan welcome\nBack I'm ... on a Sunday Morning a very special program today or well since we're twenty three days out from the mid term elections I decided to focus exclusively on politics and to get some of the candidates in here to talk about their positions and why you should vote for them or joining me next is the\nCurrent us representative from the thirteenth congressional district or on our phone line is Tim Ryan and welcome to the show congressman hey great to be on with yeah\nAll right I'm going to get right to it I uh first of all I Would like to ah I'll just I Would just like the one thing you hear and talk radio there's a lot of people beating you up and on local talk radio I can tell you that whether we are talking about some of the host or a lot of the callers\nAnd their complaint seems to be in their opinion they they frame you as being out of touch what would you say to those people and I guess I'll ask two questions here if you were to list it particularly in your most recent term or three of your ... your greatest accomplishments for your constituents\nI appreciate the opportunity and I I recognize that some of that happened uh especially on this channel\nUm you know there's a I'm home I you know I live here I Know some people are trying to portray that I'm home I live here uh we live in a house and my wife teaches a in a local school district here our kids go to the local public schools\nUm here when I'm not in Washington DC but for some travel around the country which is all and in my mind geared towards trying to help get other people elected to the United States Congress\nThat will help me push an agenda that will reflect communities like the ones I represent I Can't\nDo everything by myself I'm I'm One of a four hundred and thirty five people\nAnd part of my responsibility is to help build a coalition in Congress that that gives me partners down there and since I\nRan against Nancy Pelosi last year I have gotten more of a national leadership role and the Democratic party which I'm Glad about because it means I can try to make sure that the party is focused on\nJobs in economics and wages and pensions and health care and saving Social Security and Medicare these kind of bread and butter issues that people in our community needs but if I'm In the minority in the Democratic party\nAnd we're passing tax cuts for two point three trillion dollars that are going primarily to the top one percent and I can't stop it you bet your bottom dollar I'm going to be traveling to try to get other people like that so I don't apologize for that at all\nWell I Would go ahead go ahead yeah ... ... on the other question and I'm happy to you know talk to you a little bit more about both of these are on the other question you know we've had a long term economic development plan in this community and when I\nFirst got an office it was all about how do we diversify the economy I mean we when we got killed on black one day and we lost the steel industry it was because we had all our eggs in one basket and my goal\nSixteen years ago was to say how do we diversify into other areas and that's been the goal and it started with Youngstown business incubator a move my office in there and then the last two years it's been ranked number one and number two as far as business incubator Z in the entire world\nWe started an energy incubator in downtown worn that's just coming on line that's right into the square uh we've got Thirteen energy companies that are in there now focused on batteries will have an announcement this week with a new grant that we got\nAll millions of dollars that I brought back and then in addition to that the quality of life ah projects that were doing and and the downtowns\nYoungstown State university if you go up in war and we got millions of dollars for the Packers music call the Packer car museum the river walk the amphitheater and now we have real entertainment in downtown Warner's well not to mention everything that's going on and young style\nSo moving in this direction not to mention you know and I know a lot of people on this station try to blast me I'm One of the few Democrats that support the natural gas industry it was it was Tim Ryan and bill Johnson who passed the liquid natural gas bill\nThat allows us to export natural gas liquid natural gas around or that that was that was\nA a bill that I was the lead co sponsor on and you can talk to\nThe building and construction trades you can talk to the energy companies I Do I agree with him on everything absolutely not but I'm supporting of what's going on in this natural gas industry that has led to jobs and growth and investment in our community\nWell speaking of that some of your detractors would also say that during your tenure there's been a a massive loss of jobs in this community what would you say to those critics\n[noise] well I Would just say I look I don't have what I have control over I deliver on and you can go back and you can look you could look at what we're doing with America makes a in downtown young style which has our additive manufacturing instituted we just a drop in another ten million dollars off there last week\nWe've gotten thirty million dollars for that program\nFor us to build out with the air force with ... with the air force\nA tying it to the University of Dayton on the most cutting edge additive manufacturing advanced manufacturing there is in the world\nGot another check we'll be bringing for twenty million dollars tying the army manufacturing technology program into America makes right in downtown Youngstown so the most cutting edge of an industry that's growing at twenty twenty five percent a year\nThat is the responsibility of of the a legislative branch in article one of the constitution is to oversee what's going on and ...\nJudicial or the executive branch and if there was any wrongdoing and any regard anywhere we we have a responsibility to do that but I Do not think that should be the focus of what we're doing our focus needs to be lifting up wages for the American people and providing economic security healthcare security\nFor everybody and country go right to be that needs to be what the Democrats focus on\nAnd I agree with you there because I Do believe that if the if the you know it's not a not a big number but the people who want to pursue this I just think it's a fool's errand I think we need to say that he is the justice let's move on whether you like it or not and if it wasn't him it would have been another conservative justice because Donald Trump is president and that's the way that goes I mean the\nWhy if someone is lying to the United States Senate that is an issue that that may need to be looked at but our focus to be on these bread and butter issues that people need us to deal with\nI tell you what I told you I I'd we'd be done at this fifty to break if you'd like to say something in the last two minutes I can give you that time to ah in conclusion if you'd like\nWould you come back okay well we will do that we'll be back with Congressman Ryan right after this [noise]\nYou'd

up for reelection and I appreciate him given us some time I just like real quick I Will I Will let you say something and ... we got about two minutes left but one thing I didn't touch on that I Want to touch on the uh the national debt it appears that\nYou know we've heard we heard rhetoric for eight years under President Obama about getting deeper in debt about the deficits and all that and I've seen no movement on this under Republican domination I mean do you see I mean we're gonna have to deal with this sooner or later don't you think\nIt's a real danger and it's ... it's gonna be a problem the tax cut is going to cost after you pay interest on the debt a to point three trillion dollars that's with the eighty three percent of this one of the top one percent of the people in the wealthiest people in the country\nIf I could I had a guy challenge you out of a a pub candidates for on the other night saying that he's actually benefit from these tax cuts and I actually had a coworker say the same thing what would you say to those people\nI said to them very clearly that I Would repeal eighty three percent of the tax cuts that went to the top one percent\nYou keep the Seventeen percent of the tax cuts in place that favored small businesses that favors working people who are you know doing everything right you know that that are that are doing okay I think that\nPart of the tax cuts should stay in but the eighty three percent of it that goes to the top\nOne percent and the corporation's not remember this is going to cost to point three trillion dollars we're borrowing the money from China who's ready to clean our clock economically and pushing us militarily so we're borrowing money from them they're taking the interest that we pay him on the money we borrow and their reinvest and get back into their economy in their military so but here which the promise\nA mile they set and the president said the Republicans were going to reinvest that money in the factories workers and all the rest one\nTrillion dollars by the end of this year\nWill be spent by corporations buying their own stock\nOkay and that pushes the stock prices up and wouldn't you know a few weeks later\nThe CEOs of these big companies are selling their stock at this inflated price this is a scam\nAnd and the money is not going back for small businesses midsize businesses that Seventeen percent keep that in place for working class people but there's no reason why at a time of maximum profit highest profit since\nThe great depression we should be giving attacks that we can't afford it we've got to build out our military we've got to invest in healthcare education roads bridges technology research and development we've got so many challenges in our opiates\nIn our communities that we can't afford to give a billionaire or you know six hundred million dollar tax cut over ten years that and that's what we're doing so I Would say repeal that part of it\nAnd then reinvest that money back into the United states to rebuild the country that is they found practice because\nKnow what Russia China they are coming after us militarily we do have to build our military but we also have to make sure we have people\nThat are working in these construction trades apprenticeship certifications welders climbers all this stuff we've got to make sure we're doing that piece of it too\nWell I'm going to have to leave it there with you congressman I Do thank you for being with us I Hope you answered a few questions for our listeners and uh I\nUh well I don't see a stranger to the program you got to take care of yourself they were thank you very much sir once again that was congressman Tim Ryan ... re\nBack after the news as the actual\nHard was go to bed brothers dot com use radio five Seventy W ... a young child [noise]\nMichelle Brandt and growing tension over the alleged murder of Washington Post columnist Jim ... Saudi Arabia rejecting what it calls are threats by the U.S that after President Trump said there would be quote severe punishment if there's proof the country is responsible\nTo lobby wash you to get that because I Know we need that federal investment here not millions of dollars talking billions of dollars three point seven billion dollars so there are places where I agree with the president you know I've disagree on some of the immigration issue I you know I if you look at my Twitter account I'm not Donald Trump\nUm but I don't go around attacking Democrats it I don't you know my campaign is not\nWhy I don't like other people who I don't disagree with them it's about hey here's an issue I'm thinking of\nThat I like that I'm pushing for you were talking about you know there was there moving to a gag order last week our pharmaceutical drugs which is something I hear all the time how expensive pharmaceutical drugs are\nAnd I try to explain as someone who's been around the industry and all different sides right the generic side that you know that are in D side you know there is costs to go into it and there are negative things that go on around the world I mean I was in a situation where we saw stage three drug that accompany it invested a lot of money\nWas already being faked in China before he's even going to hit the marketing to approve the United states we're good at being bad right now and then our friends in Europe\nOr stopping us from shipping those drugs into Europe so we said what are you doing if you're a buddies why are you hurting our pharmaceutical companies that are investing money that are spending money doing the right things and then I can do to make profit anywhere except for the United states and so we're shouldering that bird\nSo you know there are places where you know I said there was a place I talked about pharmaceutical advertisement being tax deductible you're the purpose of the tax code and we talked about adoptions it's to incentivize right to nudge people into making a decision\nAnd pharmaceutical companies are going to play ball and lay that the government get the best price as possible\nThat we have to think about why do you get the tax ducked ability to go to consumers and say hey by our drugs by our drugs on TV commercials\nRight which by the way we didn't even have those until very ... relatively recently and and to think that they can and I gotta\nDo it right am I talking about the first amended argument why am I incentivizing can be\nNo no exactly right and I brought that up one time I was showing this guy tried to argue me Dallas I'm telling you they get the right this off they are shoving these drugs down your throat almost literally and then they get a tax break for their ... and then but then do you do understand oh by the way I Do believe that\nThat uh the the bill the president signed the other day was out oh well now it's a law\nBy the bipartisan bill and it was Iran and Rob Portman both and\nYet the okay let's let's give ... give props they very much\nOkay but uh so that's ... that's a good thing there is something we can talk about uh but I'm I'm trying to look at my notes here I did have other things I wanted to talk to you about oh cat the out that the candidate for um the other night and I heard you say that you are\nAre you with the term that tried to get General Motors back to running three shift around the clock like they did or like they were doing when I retired a couple of years ago\nA how oh we've had Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman visit the c._e._o. of General Motors if two U.S senators can't get a firm\nHey we're going to do this how would a congressman to ... get that done like I mean\nI I Will say two things one for senator brown and Sarah deport meanwhile they care very much for the folks at large town they also have eighty to eighty seven other counties in state of Ohio that they need to go to bat for in a daily basis I have five\nRight it changed the perception changed them at a time and so but you can put on something look I I think they renegotiated NAFTA when Congress goes to vote on it next year I think that's a large step in the right direction\nHaving you know to raise the wages of people that are making car parts making sure more of the parts are made in these NAFTA countries instead of being shipped in from China through Mexico I think that all goes to help us look we know that there are five small car plants in the United states of America in General Motors\nThree of them are probably gonna get to stick around\nSo what I'm telling folks as I'm going to do everything that power to make sure Lourdes town is one of those three there are no promise if anyone runs for this jobs I promise acts unless it's coming out of their own pocket book they shouldn't be promising\nBut I can tell you that I Know how important that facility as those in our perception of the area and also the people that it employs right we have lost a lot of those good paying manufacturing jobs\nBureau of Labor Statistics January two thousand Seventeen until today America has gained four hundred thousand plus manufacturing jobs we've lost twenty three hundred in this district\nIs is this going to the bureau of Labor Statistics so why are we losing those jobs and what could you to recruit new jobs looks to renegotiate NAFTA going to ... make sure I have local state and federal folks lobbying General Motors and making sure that I tell them hey guys were open for business some of the best workers in America that facility\nA great place transportation wise to get cars in and out of as you very well no I'm there to fight for them\nWell I'm Glad to hear that and and and I you know that's a good answer because the thing is as like a Congress you're dealing with a hundred congressman department they're thirty five yeah you're the author of a hundred senators\nI met ... but they're you know yeah you've got all these other people you have to deal with it and I'm In the house of representative so that is a good point I also wanted to ask you speaking of that um\nLet me see hold on just second we talked about that we talked about that I've got I've got notes all over the place here because I've got so many guests lined up today oh let me ask you also uh I think once more ... with the election of the president of the non politician is now sitting president on to say do you feel\nIt in a way that being\nRelatively politically inexperienced might be a positive\nLook I mean I think that is one of the clear differences between my opponent myself Congressman Ryan ... we both went to law school he never practice law didn't take the bar exam he's been a politician since he was twenty seven years old in the state Senate\nI went to work for a living right I I started working those jobs where you take a shower and you get home from work and I was able to go to law school and get the typical in business and work in law firms that I was pulling twenty hours a day I think it just changes your perception right it had to redo balance sheets that had to look and entrepreneurs and say hey what are you looking for to grow your company\nSo I I I Do think it helps to have some experience outside of Washington you know I did work for senator Portman for six months during law school I've seen the negotiation process on legislation\nAnd I enjoyed that I've seen you know how bipartisan folks are behind closed doors and gets a really great thing for people to see that they're not out each other's next you know down in DC until the cameras come on and they want to see the click sadly for a lot of them that senator Portman but on both sides the out people want to you know\nGet that back and forth so people donate to their campaigns and\nRaise them up in the party and their social status but you know I think it does help I think gives you a different perspective where one of the blue collar districts in America\nAnd we should have someone who's had a job before you know I paid summer union dues and that's what my life my father was a firefighter mom was a bank teller but I've seen it happen and I've had friends who do it and do it today right I have friends who dropped out of college in New Jersey in what became union electrician and they're doing really well for themselves now\nSo I think it gives yet just a different amount of experience and I think it also differentiates me from some of my Republican colleagues I mean growing up in the south side you\nKnow I'm a Republican who has walked on picket lines who has lived on government assistance for a period of time when my parents who lost a job and got back again and so I've seen I've seen you know\nEntire spectrum if someone could come at thirty one years old and obscene it's not to say I know it all I most certainly don't but I think I've lived a pretty varied life in that timeframe\nAnd let's go back to one more thing when you're talking about the right to work issue earlier when we talk about this briefly there are my at the candidates forum how it seems like every state that has gone the right to work has a Republican governor\nIt seems that you know you always hear about the Koch brothers money behind it all of them on the other side George ... of course but the thing is that does seem that the Republican Party has been particularly hostile to unions if you look at the most recent case for public unions on the Supreme Court so uh\n[noise] I don't know can you understand the trepidation some of us who have union routes have and voting for Republicans who tend to be who seemed to be hostile toward unions\nWell I'm a Republican in Youngstown, Ohio yeah I Know with trepidation is um [laughter] I see it every day no like I said you was look if there are the Republicans you set it on the show right to control the house that fifty votes in the Senate not safety if they wanted right to work they get past\nBut there are a group of at least fifty plus Republicans right that stood up for failing leaders and stood against right to work\nSome Republicans that I'm sure you and other folks you know who voted in the Democratic party usually would laugh at to think that there are Republican vaccine labor's right we have representative king on Long Island right a staunch opponent of a lot of things that people in the Democratic party like also goes back for unions every single time\nGo by the way that the king I like the other King I'm not so fond of the guy from Iowa\nBut I mean a lot of Democrats say oh this crazy Long Island congressman as Republican I met him before he's a very nice guy and you know us\nThe homeless badly damaged they say the bath tub fell through the second floor and some of the roof down onto the car in the driveway five thirty say someone lives in the home but they have not released any names\nEyewitnesses told our news team a man who was burned was taken out of the home by EMS you perform chest compressions on him before taking him to the hospital and arson investigator is investigating the fire\nOne man died during a stabbing that was reported an eye on Saturday evening according to police the incident occurred around five pm on Warren avenue according to police one man died and a woman was tickets at the hospital after the incident they said another man was taken into custody no one has been identified yet from the power Chevrolet Buick Jim sea of Cal ...\nYou know more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro and then on the Trump Administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously ...\nOkay so there you have that first of all the way they edit the cliff says what caught my attention but then furthermore if you listen to how the same story was handled by other people that was a wide ranging\nUh there were some really strange comments made by Kanye West for some reason\nA Fox only focused on the ... and I agree with almost everything ... said there that that was the more loose it those little more ... comments he made but also he made some very odd comment and I'm trying to find that I've got so much stuff lined up here please bear with me\nThe ... the ... you know what I tell you what I'll go back to the other\nA ... coverage in just a moment in the meantime I'm going to take your calls since they're piling up here and\nUh let's talk to let's talk to Iran and liberty go ahead Ron\nHorse re already pretty good excellent\nShow today excellent show a camera and he was at our W meeting a quarter court radio but here's where I'm Glad you asked that question if it pertains to Ryan and that that piece of guy when\nAs far as the jobs in as far as being able to save journal motives I spent thirty seven years out there you ... years out there thirty one you know what\nGoes on out there as far as I'm a\n... actually ... ... I'm not going to make\nEating them convincing them to putting on three shifts that's impossible I call him a liar or anything that's impossible for him to do that comes down from ... quarter Detroit you know that I Do that but here that campaign ad really used to get me\nTo hear all this time and it's like it's his fault what's going on at General Motors has no control over that he broke it down nice and neatly\nAs far as the air the air out there and different other things that he is doing that's why I Hope you keep that clip so you can play it during the during the afternoon show coffee does make me sick over there\nWell also you can check out of the podcast if you go to a five Seventy WKBD dot com and you look in the upper right corner and you click on a podcast you'll see the Morris re which is a by the way going forward I Will be ... because it's just easier to say but you will see the Morris re podcast if you want to check that out\nUm negotiate I mean the cat Kavanaugh proceedings so that's why I hung up on that guy and as I said I Hope that the pollsters will be redeemed because that is such a tired lazy comment goal the poster with\nHillary ran yes they were wrong but more they're more right than they are wrong and we shall see there may not be a blue wave per se but it is leaning it is looking like the Democrats can retake the house if they don't\nI Will gladly eat crow but it is leaning that way and then I Wonder yeah okay so they were wrong about Trump and one of the reasons they're wrong about Trump has one L some people who voted for I'm told me they wouldn't it's a pollster had asked them they wouldn't have admitted to voting for Donald Trump\nAnd that's why some of those polls were an accurate but furthermore we shall see what happens I Believe though that there are people out there that want a little balance because single party rule regardless of the party\nIs not a good thing for this country you saw it under Obama his first two years when they try and then they squander those two years of power trying to ram Obama\nCare through with not a single Republican vote you're seeing it right now with this party doing everything they can ... to leave Democrats out of the equation so yes I Would welcome Democrats taking the house and I hope it happens\nI certainly hope it happens and you should too because I don't I you know I don't care what your part you know look at the same situation that we have here in Columbus as a uh one of the earlier guest said\nOr at your other millions of your tax dollars wasted on this ... scandal the opioid epidemic going out of control and the Republicans have no one to blame but themselves because all the levers of power in this state are controlled by Republicans maybe it's time for change\nBut let's talk to Joanne she's in Campbell go ahead joy and\nI Know I really enjoy your show thank you I I'm just trying to bring on the president going campaigning\nAnd his car a paid for by our Frank\nYesterday by the way here there was another bit of a ... or ... when rock Obama had a function at the White House a week after Hurricane Andrew I Believe it will not Andrew but the one that\nThe one that uh oh that was Superstorm Sandy they got the east coast a Trump tweeted what a disgrace it was this was a week after the fact that Trump has yet to visit Florida he's\nHe's spent the whole week doing these rallies and even though Obama was a terrible person for not\nA movie and immediately on this old let's remember Everytime rock Obama jumped on an airplane or golf that it was a terrible thing when bronco Obama was president but now it's all good it's all good with the president and it's all good with the president's\nNetwork Fox News they don't you don't hear them whining about the trips he takes and the taxpayer expense for these trips do you\nYeah I just don't understand how he campaigned for Republicans so that's not in that plane to care for both Democrats and Republicans and that's being unfair\nWell no that's not anything new bronco Obama definitely campaigned for Democrats other candidates that's I think the the frequency of his appearances is certainly something unusual that's\nDefinitely it's like too often that with our cat it said that now and then I got my isn't he at the office with the rest of the government trying to as he hates Obamacare why don't they figure out what's wrong with certain parts of that and trying to fix the parts that are\nThat well that'll never happen to you know as someone once uh someone told me earlier you know you you you should say that cancer was created by Obama then Trump would write an executive order against it\nIf it had ... I've never seen\nA of a president come in with such viciousness trying to destroy everything their predecessor did this is personal with this man there's no doubt about it\nWhere other Presidents Day they may move move the furniture around a little bit but this guy just he's trying to blow up anything with Obama's name with dynamite and I it it's obvious what he's doing but I\nBet vote again for Obama and I really wish he would be back in ... he\nAnd I was trying but said he was stopped and many point\nAt every point but I Do think your call I got to go the music's playing the case you don't know what that means that means we're back after this\n\nFinal moments by the way at noon will be ah going back into interview mode we'll be joined by Michael ... he's a candidate for the thirty third Senate seat in Ohio Senate\nAnd uh but real quick I Will take one more call before we're out of time and it looks like it will be in Gary and boardman hello Garry\nHi how are you pretty good sir\nWell I you know I guess you had an interesting question or comment that that lower valid candidate tend to be more honest but I guess I have a question for you Michael ruling coming up on his Facebook page he said that\nHe was disappointed in military response regarding students with disabilities at a forum that he wasn't even that\nAnd uh the tape from the shows that don't share he was actually a co sponsor of a bipartisan bill to increase\nOur school funding for national needs children um I guess my question really is why why ... my comment and block from the age when I asked it and to does he support Boccieri bipartisan bill\nOkay well he'll have a chance to answer that for himself on the other side of the news I thank you for your comment\nThank you okay and a real quick quickly hello Dale go ahead\nThey'll yeah yes or how you doing this you've only got ... seconds go ahead okay I\nWant to have a like we're really short term memory of house and the lady of a Republican flock everything came back and now they're saying that Democrats are like\nOut of control\nI totally agree with us but that's why I think there needs to be balanced and we'll see what happens I Know you know I Am so sick of the as I said the tire talking point that the polls did they did they made historical miss on the election Hillary was supposed to win and every poll you could see\nBut it didn't go that way but that doesn't mean that no poll ever be right again they'd been rights and several of these elections a special elections and other things so I just think that's a silly starting point that's why I don't even entertained those calls\nBut we shall see what happens and I do believe that history will have a better opinion of the president than the current president does about that as President Obama\nI Do think that uh uh he was definitely blocked at every turn let's remember before even got the oval office chair warm beverage trying to make him a one term president that's why his second when was one of the best days of my life it was just kinda like hey stick it guys stick [laughter] you know stick it\nSo\nWe we shall see what happens but you know ... to swing this may be the Republican moment but this will not last because people will grow tired of some of the things that are going on right now I think they they it is a great time to be a Republican for the moment but ah the sunshine again I'll Democrats there's no doubt in my mind\nAnd they they definitely need to have a you know we're all about Ellen why would we want to let go\nI read whatever they\nIf any president ever needed checks and balances if this one and I hope the American people will agree with that I thank you for your call Dale we're going to the news at the top of the hour and then we'll be joined by phone by Michael ruling\nAnd after him we'll be joined by his opponent John Boccieri right here on news radio five Seventy WKBD in [noise]\n\nNumber one and has a number one single man

a holding the fifty ninth district how Ohio route of\nOhio house of representatives seat that was vacated by Ron ... ah I'll get it out Ron gr Barry it's been a long show sir but joining me now is John Boccieri and thank you for being with us\nPay more for the taste it's an honor to be with you\nSir are well you are familiar name in this area of for your political activism and your political service and your military service as well\nI'll start off by saying what do you say to the people and you hear a lot and talk radio they seem to be we're in this uh everybody wants to new blood they they seem they seem to think that what I see as experiences somehow negative that maybe hey why don't you go do something else now what do you say to those people\nWell first let me start off by saying I give Mr really a lot of credit for stepping forward to run for office ah especially being a businessman you know ah it's often difficult you have to put yourself out there you open yourself up for attack and that's\nCan be a delicate situation being a business owner or because you know you may you may lose support just based on the facts are at your business based on the fact that some of the political positions you take and ah so I gave him a lot of credit for stepping forward to do that takes a lot of guts encourage or that being said\nWhat I asked people is and I have to bring it down and break it down to an aviation related scenario I said would you would you climb on an airplane and feel comfortable if that pilot it never made any landing\nOr do you want the more experienced person that has had a couple of landing that knows the um uh you know knows how to get things done and and have a proven track record of working across party aisle party platforms if you will to get things done\nAnd you know just in the last two years that I had been in the ... the general assembly a I've had enough my ideas become law oh and\nYou know a track record that goes back a a to a working across party I'll you know I got the military injure relief fund\nPassing the law allows a check off for taxpayers to help soldiers returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan we've had catastrophic injuries a that was while I was keeping the minority as a Democrat in the state general assembly two\nHundred yards setback for military protesters at funerals you may have heard of this Westboro Baptist church group that comes around it was protesting at military\nFunerals yes other gotta we gotta we had a two hundred foot set back on them all\nIn my opinion I just think you know the there and usually what they are protesting as something like a they're protesting homosexuals or something but it has nothing to do with the grief that then family is dealing with and I and I'm so glad to hear that you got that past\nYeah I also ah was able to ah pass legislation that um that help protect the third largest employer in them a hunting valley uh basically yeah extended research station is the third largest employer of money valley and were able to retool something to the tax\nUh I'm I'm a initiatives for local county commissioners where they can use ... tax dollars\nTo support operations out at the Port Authority which helps keep the runways plowed and the lights on in the shower and our is meant landing systems going because the air force doesn't want to do that um I've also heard a lot of talk about our community college here in the hunting valley I was the first one who introduced that legislation\nOr a couple of years ago and now we have a community college in the ... valley so these are just a small sample of some of the great things that we've been able to do across party lines\nThat being said well I agree with some things that the majority have done in Columbus ah there are there differences between me and my opponent on what we support and what we would bring\nAs far as reliable a representation to our community um the the majority in Columbus and right now it's been very troubling because for the first time in Ohio history or the Republican speaker\nHas resigned the first time in Ohio history\nThe speaker of the house of representatives has been under FBI investigation and he resigned so there's this sort of culture of corruption that is really permeated what's happening to Columbus we see it in the ... scandal you know this has been a favorite topic because some of the the governor's candidates\nOut they've talked about the seventeenth largest school district in the state of Ohio the electronic classroom of tomorrow and how they have fleet the Ohio taxpayers\nWith millions of dollars and that that scandal has permeated here to the moaning valley we've ah we've lost millions because of that local school districts that could hire teachers put chrome book computers in classrooms and you know fix somebody's stuff falling down school buildings", "show_name": "Morris Ray", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "14"}
