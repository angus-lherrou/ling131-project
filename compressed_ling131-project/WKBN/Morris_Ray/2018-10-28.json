{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Since the type of research that they do but mine is looking at my own diet and my own blood changes from dietary changes and my patients who decided that they want to improve their diet and they work with me in the health restoration and I look at their blood changes\nAnd what a what a wealth of information that comes from that\nAnd so I see all these beneficial changes from taking me out of the diet but ... you know to be fair I'm also recommending a diet rich in fruits and vegetables I mean those are the foods that\nEven people back in ... biblical times knew that we were supposed to eat and they knew that those were our will meet those should've been our meat\nAnd yeah maybe they some other things too but I Believe that when you look at the physiology the body and our digestive system and all the benefits to be had by eating fruits and vegetables and taking meat and cheese and\nThings like that out of the diet the heavy things and sugar out of our diet then you see the real benefits that take place\nAnd you know we certainly see that in cases of ah I've read studies that clear back in ancient Egypt in times that many of the pharaohs actually had to say obsesses and other diseases that were related to sugar did you know that they had processed a refined sugar back in those days\nAnd they did and uh that had an effect certainly on their health\nSo we see that down through history that certain foods do tend to have that effect on on people so I I Will try to squeeze calling here if anybody's interested you want to call in seven to nine nine nine seven seven call now 'cause they only have a short time yet and uh we'll try to get your question\nBut we'll get back to this uh uh you know the findings that\nThere was one other thing that I really want to go into further like in a future show but there was a a lab study through the national institutes of health again that founded saturated fatty acids so these are the things that do come with some meat set our diet\nSaturated fatty acids actually make certain portions of our cells more rigid and less porous than they should be\nAnd so that's one way that they contribute to our poor health and I'll talk a little bit about that are in a future show but we'll be back quick I'm Dr David Vic go talk to you since [noise]\n\n\nWelcome incredible how what Dr David ... go\nOkay I'm back [noise] yeah I have a couple\nOf pages more material about studies to share with you but I'm going to skip that right now I'm just going to add lip for this last little bit because you're not\nA underway in every morning I passed a couple of nursing homes and and I pass a you know you know people's houses that ... that I Know where people are sick or you know have had bad issues like strokes and things that I owe Terry\nType folks it really touches my heart strings because\nThese are all things that are mostly preventable\nAnd you know occasionally I ask you what what have you done to improve your health we you know you listen to me on Sundays and you know I give you everything that you need basically to do\nTo to get healthier and ... I Hope you believe what I'm telling you I I have no reason to steer you the wrong way there and it's everything I say is supported by studies that\nYou know or done by people that are way smarter than me\nAnd but I've seen it applied to life and that's the difference these guys work in the lab and they have people come in and they do a study for a few weeks or they don't see what I see in how changing your diet\nLiterally changes your life in many ways you know you you have more energy you can you need to sleep less you it gives you more years of life literally\nAnd I've heard that you know advertisement from doctors before I won't say what kind of doctors but you know or ... years to your life or add life here years on you know most of that's baloney\n... if if you don't do it dietary early there is no pill there is no supplement there is no\nMagic potion magical licks or that is going to change your health\nIt's it's a balancing act of putting things into your body that your body needs to thrive in not putting things in and giving the body a chance to get rid of the things that interfere with health\nAnd if you do those two things incredible things can happen in your body and it just turns its like turning a ship it's like steering it's like moving the runner to turn to ship\nIt literally can change your life a hundred and eighty degrees and if you're headed down that slippery slope\nOf sickness and ill health and maybe a future in a nursing home you're a man you can you can turn it around it's like putting on a pair of college so you can go up that slippery slope and get you know heading up he'll get get on the good side of the mountain again\nI'm telling you that all it takes is your effort in your decision to do this now don't put it off don't wait until disasters strikes because sometimes when you hit that slippery slope it's a quick trip to the bottom\nAnd so if you just apply what I'm saying there are plenty of good books out there you know Dr dean ... Dr Joel from and uh you know the China study um buy T Colin Powell or the colon Campbell I'm Sorry\nI'm there are many more than make do goals have good books\nAre all these really brilliant people have written book saying a more plant based diet is your answer\nAnd so you know if you don't want to believe me read some of those books most of them are available on Amazon has used books for a couple of bucks you can't be that hey I'll see you back here next week is Dr David ... go with enjoy incredible health and I want you to so let's get to work\n[noise] see you next week [noise]\nCNN\nTime is ten o'clock ... brothers can be teetering fine hard was Nineteen [laughter]\nFive from Michelle friends\nReferred Mayor Bill de do voice outrage and determination following the deadly massacre at a synagogue Saturday that left eleven people\nIt does it it changes quite frequently um right now we are strictly doing barbecue which\nWe were doing it one day a week and we had a little more of an eclectic menu when we first of and we've been open for a year now and we were kind of just doing like small plates a funky bar food\nI'm kind of our spin on that and like I said barbecue one day a week and then the barbecue got so popular people kept asking for it or we would sell out so fast on Saturdays\nSo then we just kind of decided you know it right now at least for a few months until the ice is over in the winter while we can run the smoker let's do barbeque all done and it's been quite a bit\nBut what happens when when the snow starts to blow\nI'm going to do it I'm going to keep smoking as long as I can um\nI did I was able to uh cook outside on the smoker over the winter last year I just wasn't doing the the volume of barbecue\nUh that I'm doing right now so I wasn't running it all the time but all over the winter I'll still have some Smokey items are probably go back to a couple of my more traditional items that we had before like our fried chicken and\nSome other creative things yeah I'm definitely not a one trick pony uh I Do barbeque is certainly my passion but I've\nWorked in all kinds of kitchens I've been fine dining um I've worked in Asian restaurants which is a secret passion of mine and I like to incorporate that into you know my my other menu um but yeah will do will do what we can um and just keep the smoke going as as long as we can and see what happens\nThough we were talking before the show about um what\nThey called the bark on the meat that is basically you know when you ... as I said I grew up in Texas when you get that barbecue\nIt it looks like it's actually burned on the outside that threat known as the bark and then if you've if anybody's watching these pit master shows or whatever they'll they'll cut into a brisket or they'll even on a ... you can see what they call the ... where it's been smoked\nAnd and there's just you know if you just know this has been this took a little time low and slow\nAnd but it's tender and\nI guess I you know I was just I Know you can't reveal trade secrets but if you're smoking let's say a brisket or ribs and I'm sure there's different techniques with both of those but\nUh how do you get that that uh that bark that we're talking about the bark\nA comes from proper smoking technique and I can get into that a little bit ah there's a big misconception in backyard barbecuing a Becker barbecuing if people who cook at home um\nAnd a lot of times when people talk to me about barbecue which people love to do and I'll talk to anyone about barbecue for as long as you want trust me I Will uh but people think smoking means actually getting a rolling billowing smoke\nOut of your smoker you're cooking devise a and that's wrong you don't want to see any white smoke or come when you're when you're cooking your meat or you actually want the smoke to be somewhat invisible\nUh it should look like on a hot summer day when you look down the road and you could just see the waves you know a little shimmering gather only ... well a and a lot of a lot of people think are the smoke has like a ... a very light blue didn't do it they call it blue smoke which\nI guess it's kind of blue if you really look hard at it but I I consider to be more of a clear smoke but you really want to you want to burn your would properly so you want it to be burning like a campfire you don't really want to see a lot of smoke in your fire box and you're a smoker or whatever you're cooking on\n'em and yet just cooking at the right temperature watching your smoke I'm putting a lot of love and time into what you're doing you know you don't want to just set your fire and walk away from it you know hang out by your smoker\nVia a couple of your friends over drink some beers mhm watch the fire you know that's that's what you do take that whole day if you if you're cooking at home and\nUm have some fun with it and and have a little party brings people over and then and that's the good thing about barbecue you know there's so much competition especially in Texas in the barbecue or like our minds better than his or\nHer is better than mine and this and that but really it's just kind of about a communal experience and bringing people together and that's what it should be about so\nYeah if you're cooking at home watch your fire\nTry to get some some good a smoky bark and some tender meat and if the food comes out great great if not well he's still have fun and maybe you got to drink a few beers\nAnd after a few beers it really doesn't matter does it right I Know but [laughter] but that you know uh well yeah I've got to ask ... the name space cat where did that come from\nUm that came from space I don't know it came from nowhere um I just I was thinking of made me my restaurant and so often\nYou you see people put their name on the restaurant and I kind of wanted to remain a little anonymous myself um and have it more be just a concept you know um and not be\nYou know ... barbeque or scissors restaurant which I don't know it I just I I really wanted yeah like again to remain anonymous I wanted to have something pretty weird or that people would remember\nA something marketable that was kind of easy to say but also catchy\nYou know and it's I think it's a unique name 'em that you know people will remember it's not hard to say um and yeah I don't know I just want to I don't know I'm a pretty weird do so I kind of wanted a weird name from a restaurant and ah you know\nWe use like a lot of bright colors and our logo like a lot of knee on you know greens and banks and yellows and stuff and our T shirts are pretty cool to wear so I just want to I wanted to get the name out there and you know 'cause I honestly I didn't know if people would come and eat the food or not or if\nI'm if anybody knew who I was so I don't want to put my name on it I just wanted it to be something like well what do you know what is that I kind of want to check that out something interesting and\nI don't know one one thing I had about the name was exploring the deepest depths of space to create flavor or something stupid like that but I I don't know it's just I don't know I was just something cool and quirky and ah I I almost feel like you know you hear so many names of like rock bands that are\nLike so horrible like Dave girl for example ... says the foo fighters is the stupidest name every I don't know why you named it that but he just needed something to write on his cassette tape when he made the first mix\nWould you know what the foo fighters were originally it was an air force term yes for the ah during a you know there was really a high frequency of UFO reporting in the late sixties early seventies and the people that you follow says they called him on identified hung up so the foo\nFighters where the guy that went trying to find these I'm trying to find these objects are but um let me see what else was I going to ask you well um\nWell okay you know the funny thing was as you say the name was out there but I remember riding up and down federal and even the next street over what the police department is it always always forget that street name but is that front street a that is\nYeah that's our Orban\nThat's bore me okay and and I said well where is this place you know I had no idea you were inside another entity and by the way if you're just joining us you are\nA space cat is located inside the draft house on federal that's right too one nine west federal street OK which by the way they dress and I'm going to give them a shout out to because I Am they are a self described dive bar a date or not offended by that term and and I uh you know and the thing is I did want to mention\nThe food you cook your food you could reach order fresh\nRight basically so if you go in there just expect to sit down and have a beer or two while you wait for your food and then I guess what I mean you've had a couple of beers and then you've got something good to ... ... either there on your way home\nThat's a good thing about the concept is it's a it's not a stuffy environment you're not sitting at a table waiting for you know you're you're hanging out at a bar\nAnd that's that's what I wanted the whole thing to be just\nVery casual hanging out um I actually originally I called the concept find diving [laughter] All right because it's that I still have that like on my on my business cards and stuff which\nYeah I mean we're we we put a lot of love and passion into our food and we do it well we don't cut corners um and we ... I Do everything as if I were working for one of my old chefs\nAh you know at a five star restaurant or something like that um just because we're in the draft that doesn't mean it's a\nSloppy or craftsmanship you know we write I go in there that's my little domain um I make sure all my ingredients are fresh and nothing will leave that kitchen unless it's perfect I promise you that um well you know everybody makes mistakes sometimes we mess up orders\nA and you know will eat it is where we get hungry but I won't serve anybody anything that's not one hundred percent perfect\nAnd to be clear though as I said ... you really you know people couldn't call up and say an order this and that because you like right ... ... it's just you'd rather than be there so they can get a good and hot and so he ends by the way so you don't get stiff to leave couldn't crack up you go through all the effort to prepare that order and then they never show\nRight and we don't have I mean we don't you know we saw that last night um the ... we have to make sure everyone eats we have food to serve everyone you know because the food we buy getting pretty busy as of late for the food has been going quick so yeah we don't want anything going to waste are sitting around and getting old you know\nOkay by the way real quick before because we're coming up we're closing here and just a second but a a quick shout out to my favorite bartender at um at the draft house and that rock\nRock see\nI don't think the parts of the United states told that got to go do that but I Do think when the president of the United states continues to uh speak and an irresponsible fashion I don't think he's helping things any\nAnd and some of you think it's just amusing and and the you know it's great that he goes to rallies in place for the crowd but people are listening to this as always said as I always say this is not simply a matter of him\nA stating his opinion this is a matter of the president of the United states making comments that are questionable at times\nWhen you have the president of demonizing his opponents I think that's a bad thing\nAnd I think it's a terrible road to go down I don't think this is who we are when you see the president constantly exhibit his personal pettiness as in the case of John McCain or the man is on his deathbed and the president went to a of\nOf the they had a defense bill that was named after John McCain specifically yet the president and his as I say his pettiness refused to even out of John McCain's name or the situation after his death where he played games with the lowering of\nThe flag to honor of a military hero and long time senator and now you have a president United States who refuses even call\nThe people who were sent these pipe bombs out of pettiness were better than this and let's see if the elections prove it [noise] I ... back after the news [noise]\nThree years ago making a murderer became let the TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered rave injustice in the criminal justice than it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Stephen ...

in on election night\nAnd will be live here in Studio until eleven o'clock election I Will see how how it goes in my own mind that as I've said many times in the past few weeks you don't hear me using terms like blue wave and all that but I Do believe that there's a couple of things that will come out of\nThis election this will either be of either everybody likes the current political climate and wants to keep it going like it's going or they would like to see some checks and balances put in place\nAlso another from another angle I think this will also be\nA chance for the pollsters to redeem themselves they missed it so badly in November twenty six team and a President Trump by all accounts was would have never become President Trump according to the pollsters\nMaybe they'll get it right this time the houses definitely trending toward Democrats the Senate not so much but that was always going to be a heavy lift\nBut we'll see what happens I Would just say please get out and vote I've already voted you'll have early voting in fact up until the Saturday before election day you can vote on that Saturday if you want to get out and vote it is not that hard\nYou're in you're out and you are letting your voice be heard but let's get another voice heard I'm joined now by ... borrow and she's a familiar\nAre familiar a presence in this area and you're also become now you're a national presents because of your frequent appearances on Fox News and Fox Business and welcome to the show\nAre literally thank you for having me I really appreciate it happy Sunday and I thank you for including me this this morning\nRight and and um for people who and of course you know we have a national audience thanks to the uh are streaming and that kind of people who don't know who you are in your history will introduce yourself to our audience\nSure absolutely well I was a ... a state senator for trouble after Beulah northeastern jihad is counting\nOn so far northeastern Ohio part of the ... valley and east of Cleveland ah for ten years I'm almost four of those years I spent as\nA the Senate minority leader um and my area of expertise in the work that I've done is is predominantly in the areas of of health care and victims right so I pass laws\nAre actually in conjunction with Republicans on everything from Medicaid reform to ah the protocol to clear the rape kit backlog so that's me I'm also a license social worker I trained in the level one trauma center here in uh\nI'm In in Youngstown St Elizabeth now Murphy health and um\nAnd now I I Am at American University we have term limits that Ohio is as many of our listeners now and ah so I go back and forth between a home where I Am now in Ohio and Washington DC as part of the faculty at American University school of public affairs\nAnd yes or a frequent guest on the Fox network um with a new with a new weekly column on Fox News dot com [laughter]\nWell you were busy woman I Know that but let me ask you are speaking of Fox News which of course has a definite point of view regarding political matters and you seem to be able to be a voice of reason there you\nYou uh how do you do it though people ask me how I keep and I don't think I'll keep my cool here but when you're on a network that is certainly don't want you to buy the hand that feeds you but what I'm saying a network does definitely has a certain biases all news media does but how do you\nHow do you navigate those waters that expressing a view from the left of when you know you're stepping into the lion's den basically well\nOne one thing that the the hand actually doesn't feed me I Am unpaid so just just for clarity safe but I think that the reason why I approach things the way that I said it's because of my personal life experience because I work\nUm you know with Republicans and the legislature for ten years um I don't see you know at at being a left versus right paying as much I think that it is important for um voices\nFrom the Democratic party from you know center left to have a civil conversation on and I think that it's it's imperative I'm In this day and age if we're going to participate in civil discourse that we do so I'm with respect and with civility because it is lacking so I always try to remind myself of that\nAnd certainly there are times that are frustrating or nerve wracking or whatever but um I think I come from it from a place not of being a journalist or a you know a political operative but rather as um you know a former public servant who still see things through that lens\nOn and sort of yours as well as as um I you know when I interact with him on Twitter it's like I'm like you know I interact with constituents I guess that's how I sometimes get 'em so you know you'd have to treat everybody with respect even if they don't treat you with respect\nDisney recently write a column about why you are standing with your party I just saw okay and could you give some of the bullet points from it\nSure absolutely well as I mentioned earlier on Fox News actually asked me to do a weekly column which is going to be running on Thursday\nProgressive in states like Ohio you know whether it's Elizabeth Warren ... Harris I'm you know ... book or you know in the like\nRight and you know and by the way speaking of the far left or a portion of the Democratic party though there's Bernie possibly rearing his head again and\nA Bernie and Biden will both be eighty years old and twenty twenty or do you think there is a a a point in this where you say listen you're you're taking one of the most stressful jobs in the world and should you be taking a job at eighty years old\nYou know I mean I I honestly don't like to do the ages and thing because it really depends on who you are I mean and and how you know mentally and physically fit you you are I mean so one person's eighty might be another person Seventy [noise]\nUm but I hear what you're saying I mean I think that the bigger issue here is the fact that you know we have so many people in this country and so much talent and a lot of\nYoung cold on that our government can you hold on to do with the ... year old ... ridiculous I'll let you finish after this Margaret\nJ\nMake every occasion event or wedding special with chocolates hallmark cards and gifts from Austin Town Goran chocolate tier box of chocolates gift baskets and candy

... on a Sunday and I'll have a closing moments with ...\nAnd I thank you again for being with us from court anytime and\nUh well I I talked over here a little bit at the end but the your bottom line was ... when I mentioned the ages of twenty twenty of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders you say that you don't want to get into ages um but uh so I and I respect that I I just like it was just no worthy\nUm they would be the oldest candidates ever if they run\nRight right well look I mean but but you know some of that the inclusion of all of that is that I think the bigger problem is how are we at party that is still you know cranking out people that are over Seventy or more and more\nUm for the highest in the land I mean I think you know we have a number of other younger individuals I think that we need to look\nOutside of Washington and to governors and mayors I'm like Landrieu for example and and Louisiana\nOr near South Bend Indiana name I can never pronounced as an incredible resume being a veteran numbers are hard and and all these other things we need to look I think outside the traditional\nUm pecking order ... and try to act how is that I'm not eighty or hold 'em because when you don't need a future\nAnd and eventually um you know The Elders of our party um are are not always going to be there\nAlthough it seems like some of them never want to leave [laughter] that's true\nBut ah speaking of that new blood or I I see a potential\nNational presence whipped up Beto O'Rourke in Texas\nAnd you're from ... yes I Am\nYeah no I agree with that I mean I I think that it's a long shot for him to win but I think of how um how much money he's raised and the kind of national profile is el um you know over the last you know Eighteen month or so I think you're absolutely right that he had somebody who has proven that even in the fact that they can make an impact\nIt's certainly an issue that needs to be addressed but when you make misstatements or when you when you fear mongering Mr President you are not helping one of the reasons the shooter yesterday did what he did was because uh there was a Jewish or Jewish organization that had been trying to help\nRelocate refugees to the United states now of course as I stated in the past this president is not only going aggressively after illegal immigration he's also trying to limit legal immigration\nThis country has a history of letting people from oppressed parts of the world into this country\nIt's been the way we've done business for a lot of for a long time and I just think that\nThis man is not helping\nI'm sick and tired of people giving him a pass and then the ... the ultimate attempt at a verbal jujitsu it's where bombs were sent to all these different politicians and to Fox News I mean part of me too [laughter]\nNot Fox News strangely but to CNN [noise] so but then the president blames the media for that so it's the media's fault that guy is sending bombs to a media outlet explain that one to me\nBecause see what you see here is a guy who was so into himself when he talks about our need to unify\nAs somebody who's observed him over the last couple of years what Donald Trump means when he says that is you guys need to stop talking bad about me and just fall in line but that's not what America's about\nA lot of people did not fall in line behind the previous president or any president before them there was always opposition\nSo if this president thinks if this idea of unity is just giving him a free pass for how he talks how he acts how he lies\nWell that's not going to happen sir so anyway I'd like\nTo hear your comments and we'll start out with a manual he's in Warren hello manual\nGood morning how are you doing\nPretty good and by the way let me give the numbers since I did and you can join us and we got a full bank of calls but you can join in at three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven go ahead of manual\nOr if I could\nI Would like to make a public service announcement a plea I'm vegan vegan anybody is listening to you anybody wherever yet I'm begging you\nThree years ago somebody showed up at in the political arena they weren't called angry white guy I'm here to tell you I might call anybody you're angry white guy but I'm here to carry it you know an angry white guy and he gets the talking Crazy Stupid stuff\nYou've got I got to knock it off well all these guys are angry white guys where he was tired of regard of right now to knock it off\nBut knock at it and to tell them to knock it off probably won't settle anything good at it it it's a nice thing to say but I I Would rather see a angry white guys who are angry guys of any persuasion who have uh who are channeling that anger into a\nMaybe a doing some violent act I'd like to see them dealt with before they commit that violent act\nFloors we didn't say anything when they got to keep those guys show with a forty seven democratic rallies God's got for us this stuff started three and a half years ago right\nNow as we as a people I was talking to somebody the football game yesterday\nWe are the people we have the police are so I'm not blaming it on Donald Trump because he won't vote where I Am voting on American people if you know somebody that's going to do a terrorist act that is talking kind of crazy you knock it off and if he doesn't knock it off your call somebody that's how we stopped\nWell I you know I just call somebody before you even tell the knock it off because I think if the guy that did what he did yesterday or the bomber did what he did I don't think somebody saying knock it off would have really affected any change I think if you know somebody\nWho you things a little you know maybe their chief slipped off their cracker and they are talking this talk I think maybe they need to have a talk with authorities\nAnd this is a lot about Democrats this is a lot about Republicans this might this might even this like even in the state because if you got somebody to talk of crazy right around looking real crazy right you don't need that person that I Believe that we're all responsible for all the little states\nIf ... if someone comes into your personal space\nYou know and they're talking crazy right\nWe have to keep on doing it you're going to find somebody will stop that's all I have to say more\nAll right I think you Emanuel okay you know as I said I I I really don't know if you're telling a crazy person to knock it off would have little result but uh\nWe certainly need to bring that behavior to the attention of people and of course the the way the laws are written and sometimes the the law a law enforcement can't do anything until something happens but then of course there are things such as making a terroristic threat\nSo people talk and certain way you can even on social media it's a lot easier to talk that trash on social media when you can hide behind a screen name\nBut there are some people on both sides let me be clear this is not just a bunch of crazy right wing or there are some people on the left but I see make ridiculous comment sob defending some of the absurd behavior\nOf groups like the ... or antifa on though right I mean for me on the left\nI don't you know they're just as bad weather we're talking about the Proud Boys these people that beat people up and all that they tend to skew to the right so you've got people on both sides would acting in a very bad way\nHate crimes are up\nAlmost fifty percent in the last two years why do you think that is I'm once again I'm not totally blaming Donald Trump but I remember during the height of a\nOf during the Obama years out here people on the right call up and they were oh my gosh they hated political correctness you know sometimes what passes for political correctness in some people's minds as what we used to just call common courtesy common decency\nBut now it's All right to say just about anything\nAnd uh that you're just speaking your mind so if you're denigrate in a whole group of people or a whole political party then that's just fair game I guess\nMay be the idea of having a weapon that can kill so many people so quickly why don't we just stop the nonsense trying to say that the gun is not an issue\nBecause ... I because in many of these shootings yes the gun was an issue because have you had a six shooter maybe he would have had to reload but if he's got a thirty round the clip or magazine for the people who get into the Mannix\nThen he's got a lot more ammunition to throw down range in a very short period of time\nAnd the president once again his answer he doesn't want to talk about modifying any gun laws or anything like that or expanding background checks his answer is to have an armed guard and every church or synagogue\nAnd I guess that's all right too if you want to go down that road or maybe the Catholic Church is to start teaching their ah alter boys ah give make sure they all have cc W's\nAnd ah then then of course the in the Baptist church let's make sure that the guy playing the organ or the piano has a gun yeah that's the America I Want to live in or do you want to live in an America where there are places where are the where you can feel some degree of safety I can tell you right now though um\nI personally limit my my exposure\nTo my fellow human beings that goes I think there are so many people out there who are so\nOn edge these days so much anger in this country on both sides you hear me I'm saying on both sides but the party that's in power the party that could affect change of some of these gun laws\nAnd how we treat people with mental illness that party has repeatedly done nothing [noise] your comments are welcome at three three zero seven to nine nine nine seven seven I'm ...\nYears ago making a murderer became less the TV show than a force\nOf nature and did uncover to rave injustice in the criminal justice than it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this even Avery and Brendan dancey trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am to park to overeat budding emerge\nReminding a murderer is now on the ...

J.\nD. N. dot com driven by ... ... dot com selling America's Best selling brand [noise]\nThan\nWelcome back Murray on a Sunday and of course we're talking about\nThe tragic events yesterday in\nPittsburgh and I I also wanted to bring up a there is a\nTime magazine coincidentally\nIf anybody tries to call this opportunism or or media sensationalism they had a special issue called guns in America that was released on October twenty fifth and let's bear in mind that yesterday was uh twenty seven so\nThis is not opportunism on their point a ... on their part they had no idea this was going to happen but it just in case you hear anybody try to spin it that way the facts are\nAnd it's got a picture of various people holding guns criminals and non criminals and are it's kind of like a sergeant pepper cover except everybody's holding guns all these uh this this desperate desperate crowd of people\nBut the simple fact is that uh that's out there and it needs to be talked about ... but also I did want to go back to the bombing real quick just a shout out to all the people on the right the media figures who\nSaid that uh the bombing was a false flag and if that phrase was popularized by Alex Jones or the king of the ten fall hat\nWho basically when something happens it's not what it appears you see they just did this he called Sandy Hook a false flag so no kids were killed according to him this was all a big thing to try to take your guns away but let's ah a shout out to all the people on the right that said that\nNow we know these were real bombs apparently this guy was such an idiot he didn't know how to make them explode and thank God for the people they were sent to but let's remember that\nA name check please all the people on the right that said this was a phoney baloney thing when ultimately according to the FBI and everybody else this was real and these people were targets of a not a not\nA ... probably who just happened to be a big fan of the president of the United states his van attest to that\nBut here's the roll call Ann Coulter actor James Woods Geraldo Rivera\n... she's a the the current conservative girl because she's black and she's a conservative bill Mitchell Rush Limbaugh Michael Savage Lou Dobbs Mike Flynn junior ... who was recently part and by the president by the way a\nKurt ... Laura bloomer and Jacob walls and that by the way his spelling W H A pardon me W. O. H. L. shake up Wallace particularly a rabbit trunk Trump supporter\nOf some of his tweets are just crazy if you if you see him on Twitter\nIf you're a big supporter I think some of his tweets even make you shake your head and if you're not a supporter you might want to look at it just for entertainment value but anyway so all these people said this was all set up and it was they were just trying to Democrats just trying to get sympathy before the election oh well you're wrong [noise]\nAnyway let's take those call finally up next is Gary who's in Lexington, Kentucky hello Garry\nImmoral and thank you Yes sir [noise] all due respect\nUh it's up to the chase once more [noise] and I'll\nTry to be humble here but I'm going to call a ... I've got some unsolicited advice and wisdom if you will for my democratic friends mhm sure that reality\nThe reality is we can talk\nWe can discuss issues we go back to war can sit around a table with you know look at all pretty and all this and all that but the bottom line is our democracy in my view is on the road and others and you're probably in your view too I'm sure no absolute America\nIs waiting noon here's the ... America as we knew it and no it is on the world [noise] I don't want and Olive Garden ...\nForm a government 'cause that's what we're we're we're already there somewhat I don't want fascism which are which I was from a president and that's what we're getting\nSick and tired of people say using this cop out oh socialism socialism my Social Security if you don't like Social Security which is I guess socialism give it back when you get sixty when he gets sixty two\nWhat about let me come down here ... let me real quick because I think you bring up a very valid point that a lot of the people you know ... when these programs were initiated when Social Security was initiated they were court cases against the just like the war against Obamacare because they did see it as a form of socialism there there was opposition to Medicare\nAnd now we realized that so many Americans depend on these programs\nAre are you know and it to a lesser extent you can even describe insurance in a way of socialism you pay all this money that you may they may never benefit you but guess what it goes to your neighbor when they have problems but when you do have a problem it's there for you so if you buy socialism you mean looking out for the greater society for the greater\nGood yes that I don't think that's anything to be ashamed of it\nSo I Am saying and I know I'm not trying to bring this up like I'm Better than anybody um got more wisdom or anything I Am Seventy three I've seen a few things and I'm telling you folks\nI'm telling you from the bottom of my heart were on the road [noise]\nWe're headed for an oligarchy fascism type of government and Mr Trump who said when he did that than John McCain or John McCain won I was on his deathbed and didn't even mention his name I was done with Jim this man is a demagogue\nThat guy is ... that's the guy that wants to overpower government wants it once it got one of the bill that tell me how to live\nMy life well here's the one where the ones that are fighting for freedom in this country if Donald Trump as\nDeregulating Donald Trump is giving our own money back to what that's why the economy's explode\nAnd that's why we have three and a half trillion dollars more of that as well because these these tax cuts this money he's handing out your money giving back to you\nPack we are not we're going deeper in debt that's all I heard for eight years was dog Republicans whining about debt and deficit but it seems to be irrelevant under this president for some reason what happened there\nWas a tough year argument there you're in Iraq and it's so this increase it because it cuts revenue has increased\nYeah truly more revenue coming it because it expand the economy you act as though the climate was going to expand anyway without the tax cuts that's that's that's a that's a that's a fallacy I Wonder what is that what is the plan is spending here there are still spending like drunk and Democrats down to the Republicans are\nExactly at least I think you were admitted that because after all the talk about how we the conservative Republicans are fiscal conservatives as well they are not exhibiting that behavior and I'm just asking you to admit that they're still spending as you said the tax there is like CrossFit Democrats\nTheirs and by the way and as far as your ... or characterization of what people on the left won't listen for some reason all you guys think that\nThat will say oh you guys then I'm just as bad as you but a lot of conservative seem to think the I don't want the government telling me what to do but I don't think every regulation is a bad\nThing I think some regulations are in place if you look at the history of the FDA and OCE on UPA these things and come to be just because somebody decided they wanted to bother people can they can you over regulate yes\nBut I'm Glad if somebody's checking the purity of my food the purity of my medicines and all that kind of stuff so when I hear about some of this deregulation I makes me nervous because some of those things are just guard rails on the highway of life but it sounds like your answer is I have no guard rails if you fall off the road oh well\nWell let me get mad at all um evidence here\nUh uh over overbearing government I I was I I stopped by a by used to play paintball with a and as a jury store and a couple of guys come it came into by silver and you know they weren't on guard and they were just talking about the game was over here how\nAll this regulation about that I mean you have to have it there for different sees you got to have where different types of born on your thing my buddy\nOn his own property\nHe had he had he had a game weren't on his own property challenging him you know ... well you you don't have you don't have um you should have a a strap on your on your deer stand you you don't have enough tape around round your ... I mean it's just I think it's almost like a tropical except it's on his property\nOkay and that doesn't get well and that but he lives on your property property in this particular my money not your money my money\nAnd this particular case I agree with your a concern there but as I said if we're going to reach a reasonable ... revolution of some of this stuff it won't happen by you vilify the laugh the left to laugh because everybody on the left I think a lot of people probably\nAgain the problem here is the the other ones pushing for more regulation well Democrats if if they don't want to mandate something they want to band\nEverything every damn thing they want to tell you how to live your life well I don't like I don't like it all I Want to be able to enjoy the fruits of my own labor\nWell that's fine I mean I don't think you know but you know it seems like what I also hear from a lot of people on the right you also almost seems like you want to live you want to enjoy that beautiful life would you want to live in some tax free Nirvana where you you just enjoy all the the fruits of this country but nobody wants to pay for it anymore so\nSo so what we're going to get back to you to build that no no you didn't build that number that\nAt least the one is Trump what say even though it might have sounded silly he did win re election but um but you know we\nHave a president now who's only concern ... do you ... you don't blame them for any of the lack of civility in politics don't you think its course into under his administration\nThey go they go low we kept them yeah he said well with when somebody that's going to attack your values yeah you know I Wish I were in high school I could take 'em out back and beat the hell out of a [noise]\nYeah yeah you got older you've got all the Fox talking points now but you still don't answer my question as usual with a lot of you guys if you will but you have a good week belly okay\n[noise] I'm All right back after this [noise] well\nYou gave me [noise]\nAnd\nWelcome back I think it was interesting that the previous caller brought up those Fox ... talking points where they say and they take some things out of contacts in the case of Eric Holder basically what he was saying was time for Democrats the get tough basically the same thing that Gary was saying from Kentucky\nThat ah I think Democrats kept hoping that this president's of some of his comments that a border on a well just said there are a little inflammatory and ... those are you like it you say well at least he's not talking like a politician but\nThose of us on the other side and those of us I think many independents we also don't think he's talking like an adult sometimes we also think it's it's beyond the pale for president of the United states to glorify\nI a congressman who slams a reporter to the ground that's not cute but how you teach your kids I bring it up time and time again and of course you hear\nYou know so you know of course Hillary said of what she said and all that I get that but that's only after almost two years of Donald Trump continuing down this negative rode on his part\nSo but uh it uh but my question to believe it was a simple one I just said do you think that his negative comments contribute to the lack of civility in our current politics\nI think he proved that type of person he was during the campaign\nBy the way that's why when Barbara Bush died or the Bush family didn't want him at the funeral that's why when John McCain die they didn't want him at the funeral because you don't talk about people like that and just brush it off well unless you're Ted Cruz and you really need the president to come vote for you\nThen you can call my wife ugly you could say my dad helped kill JFK and you can come to town and I will kiss your booty\nBut ah here some of the things that the president said over the past couple of years\nBody slamming my cat\nBut I had heard that he body slammed the reporter [noise]\nTo see him grown in rough I said please don't be too nice she's talking about criminals like when you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head you know the way you put the hand of [noise]\nLike don't hit their head and they've just killed somebody don't hit and I said you can take the hand away okay [noise]\nThey do in France and clean the video\nPlanning my CNN when you're outside a wrestling ring pack ringing punching a man and he this CNN logo covering you think\nWe know the cameras at the north Carolina rally capturing you saw that happening\nRally were out\nThere is no back and forth and running to multiple people in the back room that way for may car and truck find funny again come to a fair way for Ohio dot com for three three ... three three\nBabies\nIs as bad as it was it could have been much\nWorse than the reading from Bob Jones special agent in charge of the FBI field office here he says the courage of local police cut the forty six year old son spec Robert powers for leaving the synagogue where he killed eleven people\nIt just shows you the person he is\nIt may be ... bullet\nOh you\nKnow I'm more regulation by the way and and like I said some of these the regulations and somebody has deregulation\nHas to do with letting these are mining companies put their their their garbage into the lakes into the rivers and streams that's not a good thing or or uh uh there's even a thing they're doing in the medical community where you'll be able to be exposed to a higher degree of radiation that's real Google it\nThe some of these things yeah it sounds good I understand you can over regulate as I said before but\nUh I don't think when I hear your cutting all the regulations that doesn't necessarily make me happy and I don't think a bigger government is necessarily a bad thing but in the world over the Republican it or it's too much unless that regulation happens to benefit them the same way a lot of these farmers who are against social programs in handouts but guess what now our tax\nDollars are supplementing them because of the president's tariffs causing soybean farmers and others to have excess crops that they can't sell\nThe terms of our code of course you know\nWhat I was ... it was okay\nAnd I got to be a few of the ...\nThat were you for joining us both rifle [noise] Mark Mark calling from ... but when you shoot a semi automatic enough automatic whoever Marco suppression\nBecause you get the average person ... hit a target for around birds were in the bottom line is no room on the street ... who is the money\nWell if there's a lot of people who disagree with you sir but as I said if you look at all these major shootings these major massacre the weapon of choice was a are Fifteen and get try to take try to just do something to address that there's more guns in America and there are people and yet there's not enough guns as far as some people are concerned\nBut my second point was on I don't know if it got to run for governor of New York who were ... could be wrong but anyway you know I'd be a fix\nThe roads and New York what's that this is the main rights to the landmark like the Brooklyn Bridge will be stable\nMhm I'm assuming that I'll assume that that guy is a a Republican because that's always their answer privatization and it's failed many times in the past it failed in New Jersey when Chris Christie tried to privatize the turnpike it failed\nAnd um it failed in our vice president Mike Pence is all state when his predecessor tried to\nPrivatize the turnpike system which have been successful for decades and it went bankrupt with an Eighteen month the privatization but that's what we always hear they want to run government like a business but it doesn't always work out that way\nYeah I was\nI had not heard that but I thank you for bringing it up and I'm going to keep on moving you have a ... okay and let's talk to Virginia and a Youngstown hello Virginia\nRight for Jen Hyatt this January you might and then we'd better ginger\nOh hello they're good they're okay how are you\nUm you know I I question how people to believe what\nDonald Trump says and I thought I found that there has to be something wrong with that seriously and um\nI I'm kind of a science nerd so I Can't digging for what could possibly be wrong with them you know and it's not learn of city a logical curious like they have larger than normal and that guy in the same\nWay about this a family show oh oh okay no okay I Gotcha brain it's in their brain\nOkay but no you know the funny thing is I saw an article in Psychology Today that backs that up that\nThe fact is how the you know do do we think differently than the the the liberal by versus the conservative mind ... and ... and you are matter of how ... what we ... I mean what we perceive and our ideas on empathy and all this kind of stuff they are different\nI'm not saying these people are we're not saying they're crazy there and they have neither are weak\nBut are there are different ways to process information\nAbsolutely as they are more sensitive to fear and what does Donald Trump to better than any other president makes people fear\nFear change if we get rid of the A R pulls a cooking is going to come after you get better have a A R Fifteen ready or you don't need a our fifteenth or in the hands of set of\nOr if the Democrats when uh the the economy's going to hell you need this thinking otherwise as he said before once it leaves are only you know he alone can fix it don't if the other guys getting charged everything goes to hell I mean it it's really yeah absolute fear mongering\nFear of the immigrants fear of the\nUh you know even though he's not trying to throw out so much fear in the case of of gays and and trans people but you see what he's doing their uh after courting their vote now he's turning his back on them I don't know if you saw were Caitlyn Jenner said she regrets or vote for Donald Trump but ...\nAttention right for that\nAnd as I've said on line many times a gay any gay or trans person voted for this president was like a chicken voting for colonel Sanders so it's kind of ... I Love that it's kinda well I Can't take credit for dates all the way back to Nineteen sixty eight was talking about black people voting Republican basically\nBut I I Would just say I agree with you there are not only that though even when you have a situation where you are as I was talking about a guy on Facebook who didn't even believe the ... the bombers van when he thought he believed that the liberal media had put those stickers on the computer generated\nWhen you you know this is what I've been talking about for months though when there is when there are no facts when they're when you have your truth than I have my truth this is what Lincoln talked about what a house divided we are going to fall if we can agree on basic realities anymore\nRight and that that's all part of this ... large amending the law they also believed conspiracy theory\nOh it's like it's like um the skies are opening for me like I have cousins that are that are devout Republican for them to come on they're smart they should know better\nYou know I mean I'm a bears fan I have relatives that are Republicans well\nMy brother actually voted for Trump but he pulled the same son as the caller before the break pulls you ask him a direct question about the president's actions the president's speech patterns and he'll pivot to well what about Hillary it I\nI didn't say a damn thing about Hillary I'm just asking you what you think of how this man behaves I'm\nAsking you a winning all my brothers big on the whole Christian Christian Christian I'm thinking is this when I see these mega church guys embracing this guy I said this is what you know what would Jesus do with Jesus lie look into the camera and live with Jesus said that\nEven though I talk this way and I might you know and I speak in these broad strokes\nOr if somebody interprets it and runs with it the wrong way this has no bearing on me in fact I blame the media how the heck do you blame the media when there are only reporting what you say at your rallies when you can get a laugh or a applause making these outrageous statements\nIt it's just we're living in the twilight zone right now\nRight and ... than I think the media has to start raining and they have stopped covering these rallies because it keeps his based ... ...\n... it seems to me he has nothing that an actor he says he's outrageous things so it can be publicized and rounds up his base and they become even\nEven work glued to the man I mean yeah and ... it all this back to physiological [laughter] but I in their brain\nThank you for bringing that up by the way I I Will say another thing that it's always he wants that spotlight on him at all times and he made that tweet about this bomb thing has taken attention away\nIt was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this ... trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too hard to re budding emerge\nRemoving a murderer is now on the ... hour radiolab

to our website that five Seventy WKBD N. dot com just check a check the upper right corner and it says podcast click on that and you'll see a listing of all the podcast including this program\nAnd a pod cast of this very program was available\nImmediately after the program but I also want it to say please listen to those podcast oh you can also if you have the heart\nMedia at a party I hurt radio as you can go to that and you can just put in a more a spray or Morris ratio and you will find my pod cast there as well and I I encourage you to do so because I think it will refuse\nA comment that was made by the previous caller I don't think I shifted my views on anything\nAnd and the great thing about it is unlike some talk show host if you can prove me wrong on something that I Will go with that and and ah this gentleman has sent me stuff in the past\nAnd if I find it credible I Will say hey maybe I was wrong about this or that but the fact the fact is that we are indeed three and a half trillion dollars deeper in debt\nIt doesn't matter whether some of these programs might be working in the incrementally I agree that some but yeah you you can't argue with the fact that uh and the fact of the trade agreements\nYes ah the other president has negotiated a the trade agreements with the with the uh the Canadians and the Mexican that's great but at the same time\nUh about twelve billion dollars of your tax dollars is propping up soybean farmers because of the president's tariffs against China that is a fact so I really don't know about the way my problem with the president is not him as an individual it's him as a president\nIt's the fact is I stated I don't know how many ways I can say that but as I said I'm only talking to the reasonable people out there\nBut I'm telling you is it is unseemly that this president lets his own Patti\nA fused with people getting the way of a human decency in the case of John McCain and and paying him is proper do as he was on his deathbed and not even mentioning his name for a bill that will specifically named after him by bipartisan Congress\nThe fact that\nAh the president engages in this name calling all that on one hand when he's reading off the teleprompter he's talking about unity and everybody getting along and then\nThat night it Showtime folks those dirty Democrats they all walk there all its mobs in jobs and all the bumper sticker rhetoric but yet I'm supposed to not notice that\nThere are plenty of us that we miss presidential norms\nWe don't think it's cute or funny or any of the things that you people seem to think it is and yes I Do see a bunch of these so called Christians as a bunch of hypocrites the same people that if Obama stuff this toll oh my gosh Pat Robertson were cry but this guy can say or do anything\nAnd it's all good because their their dreams are coming true hopefully we'll go back to an age where there is no gay marriage doubtful\nOr we'll go back to an age where it's almost impossible to get an abortion possibly\nBut that so but instead all that you claim to stand for you'll throw behind tobacco man who lies\nWho is has a history of adultery all those things that oh my gosh when Bill Clinton did it and you know was so sad about it all Bill Clinton got out of his adultery was a BJ I mean this guy went he went all the way but he's still [laughter] you still think he's cool\nBut anyway it's just it's just crazy I mean but like I said well have a chance to have a verdict on all this I ask you if you feel as I Do how you feel great but if you feel as I Do if you think it's time to put a check in place for this guy\nSo no he can't just go to a bunch of cowering Republicans and get whatever he wants\nHe won't be rewarded for his bad behavior whether he likes it or not he will have to deal with the other side that he continually demonized says\nAnd just maybe we can move forward in this country and if it doesn't\nGo that way it means that you love it by the way a comment I made offhand remark about the uh the racial composition of the average Trump rally\nI Will say the president did have a meeting at the White House with a room for a hundred young black people who support the president of United States let's remember this president only got eight percent of the black vote and his ... his ratings with black folks have gone down in the last two years\nBut at least he had four hundred people in the room who were enthusiastic Trump supporters\nAnd uh basically so if you do the math if you're a that was probably maybe one percent of the people who voted for him give or take\nIt is what it is\nBut let's move on let's talk to shower east in Austin Town hello Sharif\nHigh low this history it's like you know today pretty good\nThat's good um the caller that called earlier and was saying that we should just how are the people that are really that Trump's rhetoric and knock it off yeah\nThe reason why that is not um it possible that there is because you know you can't read or what have you heard the life of its own\nBut by going to correct you on one thing though he wasn't talking about so much Trump rhetoric per se specifically he was just saying that hate rhetoric regardless he didn't specify that the he", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morris Ray", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "28"}
