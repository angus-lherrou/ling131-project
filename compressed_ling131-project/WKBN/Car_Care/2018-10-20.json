{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "But then also the main part of the website is where we have our our ducked identification duck science duck migration reports\nUm this time of year is pretty pretty neat we've got a you've got a interactive migration back then people actually log in to um be my break in just log on their post what you're seeing a write in your neck of the woods so whether it's in Ohio or North Dakota and Minnesota wherever you are that she go on\nThere and see what what's flying near me right now what somebody ... doing right now is a really cool real tight way to observe what's going on so ducks dot org and then go to slash Ohio gets you write to all the corporation that you need\nHow to use survey ducks how do you know so ... how do you know\nYeah so the fish and Wildlife Service every year does it does a a a flyovers um both in the traditional survey area which isn't in the end the call does it work with somebody about Canada to do the same thing and and the cave near ... says\nYes we'll survey at in the northeast as well and they actually fly fighter planes like should count breeding pairs of ... ... number of ... that are out there as well so uh it's it's done by airplane that way it's been done for decades and that really gives us a good picture of\nWhat's happening year to year uh with splits waterfowl populations\n... it's amazing to think what those dollars and cents goes to you know it's not just a bunch of people going out and make it a little dyke to retain the water you got airplanes in the air you've got you know research and development going on on how to make the wetlands better\nI'm a little bit more productive in probably geared toward particular species a duck luck goes on ducks unlimited donations\nYeah no it really is like as much as I used to board a machine earlier it really is you know we've got this town are we doing it for over eighty years oh yeah\nWe did nothing by ourselves by any means everything that every project that would be too has a partner with the calculation partner an organization or a group that helps us to achieve these goals and and get these habitats acres per se toward on the ground\n... what's the largest uh the the biggest population went duck has the biggest population is is there any one in particular\n[noise] I guess it depends on what part of the state of the country is limited to ... you know so it really does this and that you're going to get more you know a large population of certain ducks here do it anywhere else some\nOhio even get some black ducks from from the east coast those are traditionally a ... to ... uh Atlantic type of species as a black ducks are seeing some of those Ohio\nYou don't see many send them in ... for example as her out west [noise] do you know each each area really has it has its own and I'll get some pretty big number coming through its shores every day\nI think one of the most difficult things would be is identify those ducks when they're flying in near away from you\nEspecially at dusk or done you know when when I was coming up and they do but you know it's like anything else like the more you look at them and the more study them you know the more you can see okay\nWell that there's more of this type of characteristics I can narrow it down to maybe one of these types of of a species I'm Dale divers have certain kinds as well that works for the need to do like I mentioned before that that spring migration as to go out there in the springtime\nWhen there's fewer people out there they're not being hunted\nA little bit less less skittish and actually observe the birds and their natural habitat for the outing them I really does improve your talk id skills to be able to see them throughout the year and\nShe was coming through some of the fog comes you do in a less can be a ... or that's going to be a blooming feel that that makes a big difference so it does help come come fulltime\nIt sure does will have to do a little bit practicing but right now I'm going to ask our listeners state to pneumonia galley sports news radio five Seventy W ...\nProbably brought you Bible construction news known within the feeling industry to fabricate deliver and install on site feeling systems we'll be right back on five Seventy W Katie and the comeback moaning valley sportsmen in the great outdoors sponsored by boat construction I might Craig\n... is my guest today from ... our public affairs a coordinator\nIn I'm In Chris so we're we're we're at the top of the hour we're almost done it went pretty fast can you give our listeners an idea of\nHow to get in touch with ducks unlimited in if there's any a\nA a local person place\nIn our problem I'm so we've got chapters thinking more than fifty chapters throughout state they're always looking for new chapters to form of ... the one in your backyard they know by all means we're always\nWilling to have more um we have a gentleman ...

... car care show\nGood morning or this I'm sure very I got a letter from a Chevy a number of years ago and uh they said they keep the uh\nHey cool you know the ... thing which I always do but it's it's getting worse I had a check and a a well used\nTo be a dealership and he lost his views shift but uh I take it down you know let them each ... pressure check the or\nCooling system or he said there's no problem and um you know nothing coming out the exhaust moon leaks on the floor in check you you know they should you know\nThere's no ah you know a fluke going in there right but but see I have two thousand\nThree uh shoes my uncle's car with a are\nYou going to savor All right you are and uh the intake manifold solve plastic\nOr ... I disagree with that you might be taught you might be talking about being to plant them in to plant them sits on top of the intake manifold bad is plastic but the metaphor selfies aluminum\nWell this thing had a hole in it and they got hit in ... I was always cool and then there are always wonder well off but\nProbably not the problem they had on those two thousand three let's say a bridge with but intake planned them was ... was also Boulder to plastic ... gets extremely hot and it melts the plastic and then they have a\nCooling passage that close to the plant 'em your traverse will not have that problem I see are you are using coolant\n[laughter] well you know I mean it it's gone down I you know once the oil on Monday and I you know I I oh I Know you're burning oil that car\nYeah I don't know if I'd get excited yeah because it will fluctuate it fluctuates in rows of war um I don't know if I get excited if I found myself adding to continuously or like on a weekly basis or might get a little excited about bad but\nWell that's what I'm doing you know I tell you we took it on a trip would kind of Williamsburg and it didn't it was ... miles but come on back\nAnd it didn't put any you know you know I just recently I you know like this change your Monday and I feel the top it off and I looked at it uh yesterday and it was done I had to add a cool into it how much you have to ask\nOh [noise] I don't maybe want O M M says you so\nYeah I don't know if I can get and I I have to agree with Jimmy I wouldn't be too concerned about that keep an eye on it\nYeah you know you could oh you do that you said you headed somewhere to have a pressure tested or check for leagues you can always say it\nWas a guy last is a dealership is is a Chevy dealership you know I take it down there and uh you know he checked\nIt over he says I don't know what to do is it maybe you ought to take a do a you know a a\nBlow to probe the early ... you could always do this they make a die that you can put into the cooling system and then you take a black hole light\nAnd this guy will uh this diet will show up if you have a leak it's very hard to find but you need look underneath that with a black hole I that's how that's how they can find those hard to hard to find leaks\nI see so you may want to consider something to that effect you may want to ... you know induce a dye into the cooling system driving around for a week take it back into his shop that's got a black white and then look for a leak that way\nWe're getting to your baggage goodies from the seventies and see if you still get you're right but ... says go like black white\n[laughter] okay okay well\nJohn thank you I but I think he's All right\nAll right let's go to Dave has a twenty fourteen high on die morning you're on the ... car care show how can we help you\nA thank you for my call I got it it can feel my gas tank tops off at three quarters of a tank and you're not getting them I Try try and get kicked shutting off so I I don't know what's wrong with it\nWell maybe the tank is full but the gauges doesn't work\nLike at twenty six thousand miles on it\nStill under warranty or out of warranty I'm not sure about that\nYeah I Would well\nAha ... he's got a pretty good warranty I'll bet that still under warranty\nTry me\nI'd be curious to see how many gallon tank you have um\nYou know and then then find out you know running down as long as you can run it and then fill it up and see how many gallons it takes up it's close to the capacity of the fuel tank then it's probably safe to assume that you're gauges not working\nProperly hey you know what I mean yeah\nI mean that's what I Would do or probably run down as low as you can probably does is a light come on when you're low on fuel yeah yeah I Would probably run it down to word that light comes on\n[noise] for instance if you have a Seventeen gallon tank usually that light comes along um two gallon when there's ten percent of the capacity which will be one point seven gallons of fuel so if you would put sixteen point three gallons or yeah\nOr Fifteen point three gallons and it and it fills up then you can see where the gauges and or if it's you know if it's not on full but the tank is full than I Would say that the gauges not working\nProperly alright thank you very much good enough for shade [laughter]\nAll right let's go for a lot of calls as well let me give out the

car I've got the perfect place you can go and get one installed because these guys have been doing it for a number of\nYears in a it's probably be probably the perfect gift you can give somebody you know whether it be a birthday anniversary Halloween gift a Thanksgiving a Christmas gift remote starts at the MIT on top of that they install seat heaters\nI use it never a couple of years ago a friend of mine called one that was set up to Jimmy ... he still talks about that you know at first talks about ...\nIf you know those are two things right there you can add to your car if you're driving an older car but those are two things you can add to your car that can pretty much update to Newark because a lot of newer cars had the heated seats had the remote start systems you know a just a just a perfect day especially when it's cold like this when it's cold like there's\nNothing worse than getting into a coal car with frost on the windshield just think if you had a remote start system\nYou can have all that cleaned up cleared up before you even got in it and and coming out of work and marriage got that little Honda fit that is going to remote remote ... yeah she did that's

was seven votes yeah yeah it's not working or not work in ...\nThat is weak was during the commercials\nHe sprays it out in the woods and that's how it gets big bucks because of the ... you know the trash the big boxes though why you've got an aerosol can see where the world's biggest toner\nAnyway so hopefully when it gets up and we'll we'll ask him if he got it naturally or if it was a Senate and the enhanced or something but anyway let's go back to the radio or lines and go to Bob Bob you're on the towers were less park here show how can we\nLearn Jim I'm I have a thirty five hundred Nineteen Ninety church bras Fifteen feet or the automatic good dodge\nUm I guess it's a common version but anyway the starting and I took a true friend garage and he said if women and he said something about it has to be flashed 'em what could you send me a little bit as you could buy a computer to junk your\nRight now it's so complex\nThis one ... ... do you turn the key to that there's a quote on the on the dash and it it just is is that correct the battery is good mhm [noise] but is it true that it might even have to take a through a ... a regular dodge dealer because they have the computer\nAbsolutely yep absolutely oh you know a lot of lord of the\nCar manufacturers now they're they've they've\nGot a way to bring people back into the dealership in or what we call programming or programming piece EMs or power train control modules the way we do that is a ... you know Christ or probably has all the the rights to the software and the capabilities of doing that it's hard for\nHer for independent repair shops to keep up with that technology so and I think in your particular case you're probably going to have to return returned what Chrysler dealer\nOkay and you and your and your expert opinion of how many hours do you think that will require before they find the difficulty\nI Would probably think uh I Would think a minimum\nOf an hour probably with all the diagnostic tools that we have today probably one shouldn't take him that long ago but bart is part ... most of the most of the diagnosing is actually getting the vehicle\nTo ACT UP so if it's acting up on a consistent basis your chances of finding out what's wrong with it pretty easy\nSo he should have won crane right\nYeah but I'm I'm just saying when you get when you get to a dealership you're probably going to need to do it right\nYes yes we are\nYeah I mean you know it's so your your cars already acting up so I think diagnosing that shouldn't be too too hard too difficult for him\nOkay well I really appreciate that Jim thank you again All right Bob thanks for the call\nThank you Bye bye how about that for perfect timing we're we're at a break we're going to take a short break

radio five Seventy WKBD ... car care\n[noise] from from from from the [noise]\n\nNine o'clock ... brother and spine hardwood online at ... dot com [noise] this is news\nBut anyhow ah [noise] it fires up paying quit right away you're fired up they had a quick\nDoes this end of the security light in it [noise]\nYes [noise] that's right I did [noise] Fifteen minutes\nFor the key on shut the chaos but came back in the same thing you\nMight you might get a battery charger yes\nYou might have to re learned the key it it may be what we're calling it may be in the short term tamper mode in other words you started up stops right away or you know is the security light on it all\nYes it is on even when it's running and shutting off the security lights continuously on\nA I Want to say I'm\nNot sure though here's what you should probably do a do you have both Keyes for the truck\nYes they they don't have the chip that\nWell you might not see the chip [noise] but if you got to the security light on your dashboard it's got to the parents system already built into the key you it the first generation had the little black chips [noise]\nAnd then the newer ones are building the key you don't even see that but the fact that you've got a security system light on uh it's probably lost its memory for those keys and it's not recognizing those keys to let you start it but it shuts off right away\nBut I had it had it right it was the old battery with the battery charger on it\nBut you disconnected the battery to change it right true\nThat's might have been that might have been one has lost its memory for those keys what here's what you could try doing this some of them have what they call ... learning procedure you you've got to hook a battery charger up you've got to leave the key on for I think a minimum of thirty minutes with the key in the position engine not running\nA until the security like goes out when it's your charity like goes up then it's learn bad key\nOkay now after you go through that procedure do shot it off and then in turn turn it back on\nYes yes I think I should you might be okay that way\nOkay All right so I've always had a fluctuating gas gauge now the field gauge don't work at all\nOkay\nIt is that part of part of the problem by other gauges work\nNo I wouldn't think so you mean is that causing it to start up and start up and shut off\nNo I'm just saying that the only eight don't even know where you're turning into\nA gas gauge yeah\nWell you have to have a test to number one the the I wouldn't think the gauge itself as bad as probably the field level ma joined the tank\nThere there were almost famous for it\nYeah OK as much as I hate to admit that they're almost famous for their their gauges not working properly\nChevy's all my life and your gas gauges I've never really been the best right\nRight you could\nIf you didn't want to spend the money because of fuel level modules kind of pricey kind of expense you know kind of on the expensive side you might just want to do a researcher pedometer and\nYou know Dr three hundred miles and filled up keep doing it like that\nGot to get around and first yeah you've got to get around them first so but try try that procedures I told my Ali\nG on until the security light goes out\nCorrect okay alright thirty minutes yep\nWell minimum thirty minutes a day it might take longer than that usually whenever the light goes up then the is learned a key\nI said yeah but the owners got vehicle\nI went to a hardware store and had another key ... for\n... is that the key you're trying to use\nI'm a laid off here real quick I don't think so [noise] yeah how much ... no I haven't\nYou couldn't drive both Keyes before you go through yeah maybe maybe you've got the key to you know you had made\nA hundred other caves at right now but I'll find it\nAnd one other thing Vern when you did change the battery how long did you have the battery out of the vehicle\nOh this long enough to a hawk OK okay you know kind of Fifteen minutes of the most\nOkay I just started maybe some time then you definitely lost the memory and a key correct [noise] yeah\nWell the security light on that's that's why I'm telling you I think you've got a problem in the in the ... system that security lights on\nUm that's probably more than likely what's wrong with it\nOkay I'll Try that All right you're right
