going to solve your\nProblem yeah I it sounds like you may have a valve and about body maybe sticking somewhat and by changed in Florida I think I think Jim is on a red line I think I'd I'd pull the pandemic change of the filter to but I Would also make sure that I had flushed and get all twelve or fourteen courts out of it a try to get some new some new floating there\nAre ... especially if it doesn't do it all the time you might be All right it might just have a ... body getting a little uh the valves have they have very close tolerance is inside and if you want to get this gets a little warm and it starts to stick it could cause it to shift at a higher at a higher rpm I don't think I\nI I Try and go ...\nWell the only way the only way you can during the tour converter is if I Would probably for were mine I Would probably pull it down but probably changed the a change of transmission a filter put it back up in there then I Would take it someplace and have the entire system\nA flushed\nOh and and when you do when you do when you do that total exchange like that that takes the fluid out of the converter also\nOkay and then uh you don't think I think that Lucas has life health uh my health uh\nWell if you if you wanted to go that route I think what I Would probably recommend first would be to have the transmission fluid exchanged all of it without changing the filter then put the Lucas along with it in the transmission to see if that would help but that could help but yes the answer your question\nOkay you're sure if we\nCan All right thank you very much we

yeah ... ... a problem out had up there oh maybe today I don't know where they're at so All right sir a tax march guys you bet ya Bye bye but like All right let's\nGo to line number for I Believe it is which is Sam good morning ... car care show they're already had Sam\nMorning I have a recall question I Want to know if you could give me a little White Sox\nLoss right okay I haven't\nDone dodge caliber the engine cradle knowing the recall on it until two thousand and twenty a and it said if it's rusty\nWould get replaced okay now my son worked at a major used car dealership an ape taken several too you know the major car dealers and had 'em replaced right they said mine drastic but they're not replace and it's not rush to bad enough or not there's no older\n[noise] okay so I mean so you've got the two thousand twenty to get this done right\nYeah but what happens when he said when you're driving some he's known some of them just to last and break and fall and break\nRank rocket engine right [laughter]\nWell unfortunately a is there call um\nHow many how many dealerships have you been to\nGet to where I bought it might try another way any names on the line no I don't want you to be tied trying other one why would you try another one and then the third call it's yeah I'm well\nYou know as well as I Do one one person my coat and the other one might not\nI don't know it's like balls and strikes\nWell you know when you know reason I say I don't know is I'm sure they're probably gonna have to turn the old part in and it's you know they they could bumps they claim that absolutely they could you know ... that's a gray\nArea but there really is I agree with you if it's a recall it's a recall yeah recall\nBecause here's here's the big misconception because this to happen to\nMe a lot okay a\nGeneral Motors used to have what they call you rushed through corrosion policy in other words it was long if there was like ten years aren't thousand miles or something yeah yeah so you have to have a hole in the panel you can't a surface Ross doesn't count as he rushed through corrosion you have to\nYou know I can still remember customer's going oh\nOh okay so I see it roasting I Know is roasting but you're telling me I got to wait\nUntil there's a whole there to bring it back and I looked at him and go yup yup that's what you got to do you know so I think\nIt's the same thing here in your case a it's a big gray area but\nThe other alternative you have is to call a used to call the eight hundred number in the back of the book\nAll right and then you know suggest asked them what you should do\nA you know tell them that uh you know you you understand that there's a problem with this and you got to recall on it and they say and and here's a here's probably what they're going to say well we got you got you\nUntil two thousand twenty so right okay you know ... might have to do that you may have to do something like that but at least you have some type of documentation or something you know\nAll right All right then well thank you very much All right Sam good luck to you ... ah right\nWas Dave Dave I'm just laughing because I think it's a it might be time today for maybe a monthly visit from our friendly northern neighbor\nWho would that be and I'm not talking Santa so are you talking about ... yeah\n[laughter] no I'm not among the mood for rock [laughter]\nWhen you left in the wake Mart near the tires last card shows that right ahead as you more than a warning\nI got a thousand bucks on a Saturday and power All right well if I let it sit for more than the lake or their egos that okay after ... years ago ongoing\nSalads battery no it's brand new I thought well that's a problem and I put in several batteries and probably that's a proud of the same thing\nYou um do you do your own work you take it somewhere I take it somewhere\nProbably more than likely you have something to staying on a ... it's not supposed to be on for instance possibly a trunk polite a you've or could be a glove compartment lighter it could be any type of light that you probably wouldn't normally see that was staying on or really\nI have a half the largest um a remote starts with on okay not do it\nI wouldn't think so I you know and the only other than well maybe I don't know you're the only reason I'm seem possible be maybe is you know a lot of those after market remote start systems have that blinking light\nYeah that possibly could do it but I Would think that uh if your battery runs down within a week you've got a parasitic draw that it's
