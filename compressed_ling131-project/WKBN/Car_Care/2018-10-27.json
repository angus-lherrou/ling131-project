scope that I put on my my twenty gauge rifle shot down I mean\nUh actually worked at excellent I mean good I spend a lot of times site and then making sure shooting it and and I think that's the key to a lot of guys sometimes when I miss a having shot they go out and shoot maybe three shows okay the guns on so they're out in the woods well you know what you gotta spend some time on a on a

to Ninety six hundred\nDave welcome to the show you're on the ... show go right ahead how can we help you\n... just a comment I Want to clarify insurance issue regarding hitting a direct looking at the beginning of the show I think it was that if you're here\nIt's covered under collision but if the deer hits you it's under comprehensive mhm that is not true if if you hit a deer or the deer hits you regardless of how you word it that is under comprehend\nIf a deer jumps out in front of you and use swerve to miss the deer and you go into a ditch you hit a guard rail you hit a tree that its coalition so the deer is considered an act of nature so for most people are going to do damage to your car better off hitting the deer because your doctor well on your comprehensive\nHis lap while ... so it does not\nI don't know how you word it so that so in other words if the deer runs off when you hit the guard rail it's it's ...\nIt's ... if you did not get the D. or if you were to list the deer\nSee that doesn't mean you know what it is something that is colors you know what if you do what you hit the earth comprehensive what are you an act of nature day what if you hit the deer and hit the hit the guard real same it also had the garbage what would that be comprehensive that would make all the initial shock yeah that would be under comprehensive way what are the ...\nFirst if you had to Barbara first and I understand that collision\nWhatever you have first it's religion if you swear been hit anything it's illusion and then your wallet shake around here okay if you like the guard rail first out under collision\nWell first of all we only set it in a joking manner but but no I'm Glad you are you know the\nReal thing or the you know the insurance companies are they ... you know they'd rather you classified under collision there's really not\nSure yeah that's absolutely yeah yeah but you know what the you know are you an insurance man\nNo okay I Know that's how I Know I'm Sorry I hit a deer that's how I Know oh okay like sixteen\nWell believe it or not even even collusion to duck or even collusion claims nowadays have accident forgiveness I Know I have it in my policy I was with the same insurance companies are for more than five years my first major accidents forgivable accidents so\nWe were just joking about it but that's fine I don't know what here's something that's very seldom\nHappens right day that I stand corrected [laughter] I'm Sorry I missed that our listeners you've made my day at the end\nUh well I think the first place I Would start would be a get yourself a fuel pressure tests do ... and see what's happening overnight if you're losing pressure\nA war could be there's a ... back there in the ... and the fuel tank it could be draining the fuel out of the line so would the symptom would be extended cranking or are very hard to start until you get feel pressure built back up\nOkay I'm a I haven't done this yet I was going to do it this morning we're going to turn the key on wait\n... you could you could yeah he was running yes could try that it's a good idea if that would work but you could you can look on line and a\nLot of BS on the opposition to see what do you think about those\nNo well I think that's not going to trigger and so that would trigger a code but the one ah one prevented from starting with\nThe only other thing that may or may be a millionaire and to the you have a crank censor on that\nDo not know\nI if you do I would think I Would think pretty much so that I wouldn't want to check that and I'll tell you why because my son had a problem with his when I used to have and we ...\nAround with for years every now and then it would not start properly and what what happened was that crank censor was was corroded down there and it couldn't find a pick up a signal so you might want to look at that\nWhat the words that down to crank shaft\nOkay there are more and electrical yes by the harmonic balance or yes mhm okay what would you do just replace it over to exactly you know you need to replace it okay All right All right well thank you very much I guess are the law by by by\nYou know when we're

I just couldn't find it so I kept driving it found a life\nBut off you know a friend of mine told me he had trouble with with his vehicle is that finally the lights went off and maybe the light burned\nNow if you look on the radio that a lot of times those will get credit on the radio and that's what they'll ah they'll come on and off because the ... after a period of time of war some of the corrosion off so\nI think that's where he be looking for all right sir thank you thank you for the call yeah All right let's move right along to my number three which is gonna be Randy good morning here in the ... show the head Randy\nMoore and God the morning the morning\nI got a question for you about a mile an oil change mhm my Chevy said oh seven age HR alright okay when I bought I went down to a Chevy ... about the oil and the kid says I'm\nA gasket I should I have no idea so I bought a gasket for two bucks okay I think the the drain oil and I'd take the cap off the oil filter for all that out\nThere was no gaffe good on their on the filter on the cap the metal captain on the dream plug no no not that one to fill fill cap yes\nSome don't have to ask what would you ask you did he turned his son I used\nTo I just assumed that a lot of times when you go somewhere to buy an oil change they tried to sell you the drain plug there's like a a a plastic seal the sun the bomb in his dream plug that's not what they sold you are\nOh no no no because there was a plastic seal on drain plug okay this is where you\nWhere you put the filter on top of the engine that or some metal cap you screw it down okay like I said I took the metal cap off to the filter out more and there was no gas get anywhere to be found right that's what I'm trying to figure out\nA so I took the guys get back and told the kid there was not in there and he didn't he just looked at me gave me my money back so I just want to know should\nThere be well rent Randy it ... I I'm assuming you're talking about the oil field cap itself right where you put the wheel down inside\nNo no the weight where I put the oil and the engine that a couple of inches over for more of the focus\nIs a filter ... does the filter set inside of some ... containers that and it's not as your own filter canister\nIt's it's a it's a type of filter you just drop it there okay All right\nOnto aluminum housing okay then you have the ... screw on\nKept the you know\nThe does over top of the filter yes All right\nUh it could be on that both sometimes they put they put a gas get on the boat that the to screw it in with okay sometimes there's a gasket there\nIf you unplug the compressor and the temperature stays warm um that might be part of the problems\nThat might be part of the problem [noise] okay so if it is the problem not draw it would've been frustrated mad\nWhen I Know Sara Lee is like Carl Carlton says it could be the door could be really adores sticking\nInside working [noise] and it's in a country is just not right and he's actually break we got around my friend [noise] okay I'll Try that thanks for the call then I say Carlton yes you did\nThe region's most listened to station five Seventy WKBD in Youngstown moved down [noise]\nThis is Carl\nOn news radio five Seventy W.
