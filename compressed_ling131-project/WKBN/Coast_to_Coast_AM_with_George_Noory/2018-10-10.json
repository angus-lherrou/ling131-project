war\nNo one wants to admit it but we are right now I Believe in a civil war\nAnd it's time to stop saying that it's not happening because it doesn't affect you directly it is happening the media is playing into it social media is playing into it and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs not two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're saying if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a patchwork of affiliated in surgery or insurgency groups and we have counterparts engaging in fights in skirmishes along overlapping edges of other networks that are demanding your support and your attention occasional\n... and and this leads to occasional high value terror attacks windows terror attacks happened there turned into political radicalization points\nAbout things like gun control\nThings like immigration\nAnd it's not just that that were radicalized that were radicalized with TV shows Roseanne next to remark immediately we

because the war itself composing\n\nAnd the thing is if I say one thing we so obviously he thinks like this will know if I say nothing obviously things like that no I Am not taking any side I Would say in general\n\nThis is what we're seeing itself composing there's no official word to be called\nThe war is what then all of us were angry about everything what radicalized about everything we have an opinion about everything that doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identified the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identified after the war and that is what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we could say were little skirmishes ... and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville\nBerkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here in my my city is it is just it's terrifying\nAll\nFronts aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as rigorous missing the signs of networked violence thinking in terms of classic civil war can blind us\nTo the many actors working to disrupt the United states from within and beyond our borders we heard Carlos talking about the rough childhood cirrhosis of the word world we got a benefactor's provocateur towards all the guards plutocrats transnational credible criminal networks we have\nA Islam we have a border skirmishes where you have MS Thirteen we I mean we have everybody\nWants to come here and disrupt the system this is why are you know we always hear about Russia provoking anger this is why George Soros is always the guy that's being said well he's funding move on these funding all these other groups\n\nNow if you can think of all these characteristics if you think about how we're all breaking down into like these tribal segments and now they're fragmenting everything you can see that this is what a modern civil war looks like\nMore sporadic and unexpected conflicts but with fewer deaths\nFactions products like mushrooms taking different forest but coordinated across invisible networks waves of information warfare\nOr seeing chaos that accelerated ... accelerated bizarre of violence in all kinds of I mean look\nWe have a healthy immune response obviously for the local and national authorities\nThe goal

how civil wars are fought in in modern times it's not about dying it's about fragmenting it's about I mean some people will die and some people have died because we've had these terrorist attacks we've had shootings we had all these things going on and no one's going to call it it's a civil war I mean what what what I expected\nShow if you compare it to our first so\nOur civil war was the first civil war this is Don unconventional what you want a Confederate union you're not you don't get a get it it's not going to conventional that's the way civil wars are fought in the twenty first

encourage you to\nWell I I think it could lead to assassinations because\nIf you look in our past of remember we used to have abortion doctors that were assassinated ... and and this is the level of hatred that we're at right now\nThat the you know if you're confronting somebody in a restaurant or at their home who's to say that they don't have a gun and they're not going to assassinate

I'm UN ambassador in part because she was a governor of his state to more of an executive function so\nShe certainly extremely opinionated in into the uh you know the Trump\nYou know kind of foreign policy in line to AT T I mean I I think you know it's not surprising to the extent that Haley may want to follow the path of perhaps the person that will replace her who is Dina Powell Powell is resume reads like somebody a hundred years of age or even though she's forty\nFive she was with the administration now she's with Goldman Sachs investments for\nWell I mean not only was she would this administration she was with the Bush administration ... you know she started off in turning with Kay Bailey Hutchinson and went to Dick Armey I mean this girl really knows how to move and shake and I think if they can wind and you know she's an extremely close associate of a bunker Trump I think you can really\nUh uh uh ... uh diminish or discount the idea that that uh evocative Trump is going to take this position she says she's not going to\nKnow and she's not a dog but I think if they can can cook Joel or you know twist Dina Paulos arm to take this it would be far better than Margaret now here's the current ambassador to Germany and this girl is God\nYou know she's got all electricity about her and I I mean to wind up managing partner at Goldman Sachs without a bachelor's degree in

have you ever seen more up people in two years with members of the cabinet or his own staff\nNow I think it's pretty safe to say that ... there's the turnover rate here is a you know a unprecedented

think that you know that's a really tough job especially today and you're just button and have all the time I think she wants to kind of move on to other things and pass the baton there was some speculation that she might even run against Trump but you know this is just absolutely hogwash\nThe likely scenario is that she'll probably be Trump's campaign manager in two thousand twenty I mean

don't use it but Google Plus will be no more but it took more than that being the least impactful social media platform on the Web to killing\nMugele has announced that it will shut it down and social network after the wall Street Journal reported that the company did not disclose the security vulnerability in the spring and expose private data from hundreds of thousands of Google Plus it counts\nLet's check in with our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult to Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for him so hopeless\nIs is a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy Facebook\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to come to regret it given what's going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\n... of the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't is they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that we're that we're theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well\nWhy stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why it's her petition and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly or the first place\nUm and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who have been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I mentioned that there the Google commercial versions of Google Plus\nWhich operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month\nOr per head using us that's going to continue\nSo Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea and the first place that's the time\nYou're right it it seemed at the time well it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up\nOf serious ways to so there's

colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle ... he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect suggesting that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in presents men experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work now psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you uncover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that have been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also looked at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random\nAnd so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment got it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more want to hear us again what do we find is that they're at the mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in ... people have that ability or have\nThat's right George those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround an event that we know a producer heightened emotion and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a hunting trip basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing our attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said doll etched trickery its magic\nBut they do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a\nCandidate B. taught can cycle can ... be taught\nWell I've heard of of doing bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked\nInto it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller then and\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of ... success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo yeah there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that\nStudies were around and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind

mandatory involuntary orders three hundred Seventy five thousand residents of Florida are being told a get out of the way of incoming hurricane Michael some for whatever reason won't\nWe have no idea what's really some uh some of us they some of his left on the ones who said we're just so we got to pray that everybody's going to be our\nI'm Glad you brought up short they're really really important one because if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond the nation\nIt gives us into a window into a reality that we typically don't you with her eyes but I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling pieces of evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known as ... active cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest their resuscitated and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than asking people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for example Dr ... us and party out from Stony Brook is another one the real scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nCome back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant in cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stops after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier\nSometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is from Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patients in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be that the federal later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this new doesn't experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body\nTells the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not\nFunctional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark who you are on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that the area\nYou can't see those radio signals what's they're out there is that a little bit what what this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat is such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us\nAt our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot haven't you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist and immaterial west\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and bees\nAnd ah where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically\nI liked it sort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers neural ethics\nThat chemically the brain\nAnd therefore they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical leave the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches the going back to psych ... it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively\nAnd in the mind that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain or does it affect the conscious as the mines does thing that show it here's my question for you it doesn't it showed that if\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if\nSomeone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another we can't automatically conclude that one causes the other\nSo here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire\nSo I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation well I have a chapter on that in my book about\nThe studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall things that they shouldn't have any way\nKnowing a man or sometimes verified my medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nAnd in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another often simply\nWe

that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started into shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO the night sky\nI've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw\nYeah so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior to when the rain\nComes within within just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know that yeah\nThey can feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skins\nThe the things steam and just said we're on our way isn't it\nYet even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomena much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough\nAnd that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure so that's another reason I really wanted to write the bucket but the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field to fix that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement and the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another\nAnd when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness\n... Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat there are things in the ... fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do I get ... this has opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIs ... and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time do you bought your website and where people can get your book and then to upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K G.

[noise]\n\nWell\nThis is that time of year where we talk about those stories and we are going to talk about them now the name of the book by wrong and collecting Maureen would more goes chronicled stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic transfer medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased at the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and it was a company the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me looking forward to the next Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know very wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is a shit known as the high priest ... salmon and often\nWhen I was younger you are walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very um you know she cried upright and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question\nYou know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but\nLet's just say the town in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your sibs ability what year did to start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her now here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that Jesus you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do\nReadings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo would\nYou see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her um\nBut my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history is who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed dome stories from one to the other than you could ...\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said\nSo that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England you goes project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um [noise] you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individuals that you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually worked because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help um\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house they're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've done more than a hundred investigation is\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise] um so I really believe that\nThere are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's good reason why you don't see it [noise]\nUm so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their lives\nMore than you conclude about what this may be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped\nFrom the stairs on you know all these\nOut she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and she lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her oven I'm it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all that just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\n[noise] we had in the mid term elections you'll hear ... way way and then there's an issue we all the fate it and hear this and I

left an impression with us I think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring you\nA very on on on the particular case uh the you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as location and and the more people more pieces equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance\nIf you have reports of a ... be unseen you might bring more video equipment or anything like thermal or I or whatever\nBut you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing recording to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization\nThat you've come across that I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization visualization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations\nProbably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ghost towns in the war while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a lot of White House history funds for him and we do you know public goes on and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of course on top of a White House and we do these haunted tours\nAnd one time we were in this um [noise]\nIt's ... uh like an observation tower where it's a square\nBuilding with glass all around you and says windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and those who want to do it in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to him I'm doing my ... and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the ... the a side of the wall you know it's going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself ... she came and then they didn't want her to missing anything so I stopped and waited for ... I saw her continually walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the ... inches of snow this there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat same vocation is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base\nA coast guard reported seeing woman walking on the wall in that same location so it's that was kind of intriguing I'm\nAn I'm perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes on ah what island lighthouse in a bid for pool meals Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen my service dog all across the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no\nThere's no sign outside jumped up immediately ran to the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman that she says why would you see and I just had our dog she says can you describe not so sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I described the dog she'd just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all the lighthouse keepers after would took care of him until the dog actually died in the island she says the dog you describe pretty much matches\nBecause of the dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for it goes but it certainly saw what appeared to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back in both the euro will take phone calls next on

to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] there you go\nSo how often do you get to calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we ... it was quite common but there are so many groups out like when I first started I always say there was\nA twenty ... the other day it was new it was like twenty four in the country and all this like twenty four and a nice city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael this just an image now of the sudden right now has scarlet ... I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nYou know I haven't seen that yeah it's pretty that's you're already it's on MSN dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from a four to nothing\nThat would be good\nI think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to note somewhat about it for instance if you're going especially if you go to a big location you have to know where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noises coming out of tickle area you might want to concentrate you audio recorder Syria\nIf or a or a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I tried to get too much into the details with whoever the the quietness for lack of it or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for you strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know do the things you hear from people but you know they loved the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that go started there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us and uh and I very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house ... something we're not going to do it without you know or are we from someone else\nBut if they wanted to investigate to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted bake California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHey thank you for taking my call her thing\nAnd yeah I had a question and I had a really really rough year here at probably the worst year of my life and\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see the year next I mean you're being a lot better hopefully starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you\nKnow that's for sure yet what um okay so Brandi\nI did pull a couple of ... um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right\nUm and I obviously don't want to get your personal um but you know and
