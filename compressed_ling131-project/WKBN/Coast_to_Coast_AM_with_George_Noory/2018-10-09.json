where President Trump is called\nThe king about that for a moment\nSo what Donald Trump be fully aware of the fact that there were books written about a young man named a barren Trump who was advised by a man named John\nThese are some very interesting seeing British season coincidences that made me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group to go to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nBelow my friend are you doing you love your show what you're talking about it it's another as usual mind thinking situation that\nYou always open the canals can and let the mind begin to think last year I think you I Love that you knew that thank you so much yeah and well let me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and as a person has come up with the idea that their boss away something good because you'll notice what protections a lot of times it says hey there's something good comes up or something bad happened\nI think one of the other\nAnd ah so you know [laughter] people predicting than people who are in the past it protected thanks\nYeah I Know that the best Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to\nUh put on there was a probably something that was played after World War two and England because of the gentlemen talking\nAnd it sounds like he's anguish and he's just trying to bring hope people make them realize that someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that [noise]\nThat's what that's all about as far as people make a prediction guys are good or bad now the the secret you know I totally believe that also as you're saying they alter plus\nAbility it's I don't know myself personally it is but with the way the world is today and the way it is today and the way the issues are and the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably cigarette\nBlew my mind is the you know here we have John Trump who is a Donald Trump ... who had all of Nikola Tesla's work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a big helping creeping X ray machines much of what tests as work was about and Lauren Tesla created a death rate of that ah most certainly you know speculative there but it's like well John Trump's that will nothing was found that was a very important but yet John Trump\nWent along it became this and this and then Donald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays at mar a Lago and this is where he kinda hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls is is the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about are also the ah the story about Baron Trump\nAnd the story about the last president it's just been amazing a kind of coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nWell one thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what she criticized Clyde too is the fact that usually it's the people that have the money\nThat's right and if and if it's some sort of time travel secret society man that that explains a lot of pressure Robert thank you so much for your call

G. wells are as you know\nThere was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another picture movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fable time machine and the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic weights as H. G. wells\nMarried Amy capturing Robbins\nDied in Nineteen twenty seven and it's just as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a baby and socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a a utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a ... that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War distorted Nineteen forty\nUh the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate what really happened in World War two well then he wrote several of his books that\nThat there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing it kind of like well\nOh safe dot com today that's right oh save dot com rhino safe dot com\nWhat do we know about his family what do we know about his relationship with Nikola Tesla what was it that he found in those papers that were seized\nBy that alien group with the government the FBI and why is it that he likes to stay in the U.S like what ... talked about this this place where plus ultra is all over the title\nAnd plus ultra is a fictional [noise]\nTime traveling secret society where H.

was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWell George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin i._r._a. instead of a gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about it pointed traded for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins\nThat were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and with stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWow that's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is bitcoin on currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people want to own it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any

Dan rivers\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nWelcome back to coast across we'll take your phone calls next ours we talk about the high technology artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time\nThat will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand than two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find maybe one person in ... doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nWe know these technologies can do an enormous amount of good they can they can feed the hungry and diagnose illness and do all of these things and I'm not sure that introducing an element of like it may turn on us\nThat that may be more ... than they do is a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine\nWould do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with uh\nI I always transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could out of the airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane full of people\nI think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer fly all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and and we come you know we're better now I think\nAt writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth on this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the ...\nThe main thing that fuels their technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was calling to Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer\nOr they thought that was very interesting reason which was Newt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws\nBecause the laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the intelligence we done that being said people got excited about a bunch of money came and everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up to space up his face up to space it's delivering the good it it can if you out of business you can make public any department in your business to ... percent faster temperature ... better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nThe technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and they are\nAh we probably had twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today to the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now will we ever have a a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with the land mine just hypothetically that said uh it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder and\nYou know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess it's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of mass killings systems I think it's disingenuous the debate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't uh they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a a weapon systems\nIt's good to have it well for\nFor three very easy reasons you can argue that ah ... the better the more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ...\nOr ... whatever country you are and and and third you know they won't they won't work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost of going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nUh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean do you see the day though by run that now we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but\nYou know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars do you see the day that you know all the entire post office system will be done because they'll deliver and with\nArtificial male people for example but think about that will be back\nTo find out where George ... speaking go to the ... school down to the bottom and click George ...\nPeople in these cars cranked up ... and all that stuff\nAnd it's always great I Love you know for me you know designing stages and all that fun writing show and all that's on\nFans get a kick out of that the first and foremost thing for me is the sound great uh I Want everything to sound as great as I can make it sound and when it just sounds close to the record as I can get it to sound and have the energy and excitement everybody wants which you have to do is you have to walk out there and there's a sort of spoke a contract between you and the audience that you're going to\nBoth sort of Mrs is conducive environment let them use the takeover and sort of just fall into the river and yet I think that that's what you were you know most nice to have some nice it doesn't mean those are nice to see you really want to play\nThe tiny two o'clock ... going up there and runners dot com they use radio five seven down

replace pulse to people who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know um\nI I had a I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it I mean 'cause if if the machine can do a job to make a human do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm because if if you just use a person for stand in\nFor machine then you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in we only need you to be a machine that there'll be invented a is delivering the mail or or delivering packages something like that I could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine that washes windows I can imagine machine that automatically\nMost my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things that\nYou know but but if you take a step back these technologies\nThis country for two hundred and fifty years just as high unemployment between five and ten percent\nAll the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology five to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years right and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to\nDo it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever if you get self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of the city if you are I mean like\nIt's it's hard it's hard necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if it's a one back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be the sweat thing ...\nBillion people are gonna use it what do you think that's going to do their jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were going to vanish she would say well that's gotta be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages on the newspapers\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs are going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEvery body Everytime technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter when a lot I don't\nI don't think a robot can do a what a waiter can do you know they use spell a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean\nAre so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we had this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't going to you're not going to make machines and had the same range of moving there aren't going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm\nNot like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yeah because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer can\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know lack of one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of ours but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and we've used it\nOvercome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is that you\nKnow twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened\nOr you invented a nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world a giant civilizations emerge ...

out how old are you\nIn disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all of these things and so they're suffering\nPeople around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream I wouldn't it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough of all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're\nAlmost there and and so I don't think we\nWould speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in the world Richie ... also known as the last thing you know we live in a world

you know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the show interesting topic\nI just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that you are to be an age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought\nSo why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty are the people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home\nBut not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we will have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you\nKnow who to machine a fix my road probably good a machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine\nMachine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... faced a than than\nMore than now and Ken ... and ... they're trying to take care of him and tell them to him and then ... and ... it gets half a in a less than a than\nTalking about automatic guns\nWell you're you're taught the guests bart is entirely right um\nWe are using a condom his weapons were killed a surgeon so of course we've done that since landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines to kill a so I didn't mean to say\nThat uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but partly agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find old I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit and reach dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out jumped to very\nSimple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventy fifty nothing happened what if you look starting seventeenth fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we decided to let that and there's no limit to where the wind is going to go so vast amounts of well created a unlimited in poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger\nYou will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed the hungry people\nDon't really know crushes them to know that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that would be traumatic more to come on coast to coast as we talk about the ghost

story about to go talk\nYou know this it's it's a it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data and and I'm and I'm known you know within the organization is being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nThey couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up you know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't make this stuff\nYou know um I Would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right\nTo our choice\nUm but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so\nYou know people could feel liberated to just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him\nI also wanted them to you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that has actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the ... and like you said not a lot of ... minutes well once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners and because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them to go because I you know when this started happening to me\nUm I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand [noise]\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of the things a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe in ghost so we're almost the majority\nWere barely a minority and that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nNot all of a thing yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening\nUm but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide and you

painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghost and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes were older guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started this aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a

you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this I'm with a lot of ease because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um

Adam and Eve away from God to see\nYou get them scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all it's just a theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think it's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line on is when this can happen\nAgain is just a theory that's pretty good\nIt's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have had a bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark does it
