but there are problems and see smart cities\nAre are based primarily on data all day and if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings and street lights are just going to wake up magically and started chatting about the weather no\nWe need sensors to see here smell and taste and feel on the behalf of these machines\nWe need sensors to tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors that tell us have been damaged gonna break we need sensors to remind us or to tell us that made me a floods about to happen on earthquakes about to happen to anything\nThat can be thrown in his data any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality infrastructure integrity just go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation researching advisory firm\nFiled report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities and smart city networks shows redesigned smart cities around the data we want instead of the

at a smart city or the smart city metrics guide based on a number based on social credit based on what kind of people live there for the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a low credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're gonna have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable vibe behavioral Bye bye bye have your data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to\nAnd it's going to lead us to score cities the leaves the score people uh you know it'd be like one big Yelp fast\nHave you ever been to Yelp you\nKnow you can destroy your business by giving a business a bad review on Yelp\nIf you get enough people to rally around the basically a you know a right some bad stuff about

that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city\nTwenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors\nBy twenty twenty\nOkay that means we have to drop a trillion at once we we can't do it we can't drop you know one sense or a year or even a million sense of the year or once a year you you can't do that right and so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty\nSo how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taken care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWe'd do as smart as we do it would then particles we get I mean look

Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years\nA goal oriented creative sign all of the some of its characteristics about religion and philosophy over the centuries are not all that great but Jupiter will go into his home sign for the first time in twelve years it's the morning of November the eighth and that's going to last for almost Thirteen months\nThat is a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science editor areas in general the next year or so or by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is Scorpio and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn so it does feel\nThat way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well and one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there there there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like liquor these split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about\nSocial networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising\nAnd the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional positive war will go into its own sign actually late on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often\nToo many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbling jumble\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born at a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the look of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that three they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath were were say guess what England were independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various plant if it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what does that saying about the potential\nOf my work at this job being president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website or new one great barrier enterprises dot com we've got an linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nGoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually mountaineer I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things the sunrise birth is is it near noon his son said is it\nA midnight we're or the plot that point because in twenty four hours most the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been ordered the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of a character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which was signed rise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nAnd uh and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah isn't this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there when it happened twenty two when I got to do the other is on the nuclear at Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the coast to coast day

eventually led to my troubles along with the drugs and the drink\nIs it I didn't know I didn't the person who is fast becoming popular as Elton John becoming you know the number one rock star in the

to Jessica Clement shot three four\nAnd rivers weekday mornings they date news radio five Seventy W. J. B. and\n\n\n\nGeorge ... already back with you hear more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take so much to study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I okay it took me one year was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two\nI was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner George grungy of a a spent ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor Dane Roger who is one of the great astrologers of twenty century and he had studied not just astrology but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorize everything and the reason which if their students out there of the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was on the same spot but anyways I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they because they have to learn what's called transits of regressions with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince ... since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people had studied\nA more of astronomy telescope scale layer and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThe world went to the phony thing of astrology because the the biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nYou know how could that possibly be what what's wrong with the guy\n... what they didn't realize is who was a science it was taught in the University of Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome greet you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay worn out one forty two in the afternoon\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there I'm not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick\nIn and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this era of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nYou're\nWelcome to the program through your radio down a little bit okay yeah I did that you know great you're you're on with mark Lerner of given mark you burn the day to you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say ah of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon coming from other lives and like instinctual early this individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in another ... particularly in the last life and now with the sun and Capricorn it's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn\nIs in the process of Criss crossing over this individual sons so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nTo that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things um but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused in a has a good attitude about things\nYou have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not healthy now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on and other people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about\nMy life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess so how would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people in mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there was a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto a movement toward your son and the next like year\nOr two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine to in two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of a link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy\nAuthors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be hard it could be music anything a hobby a craft an

part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals'\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology it was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis who many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can\nAround from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere on the planet to understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as the sun science Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a Taurus son signed tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you of mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroids that says a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what you know something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously okay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection\nBut you want to learn more about

rows back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw a bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but tux and shower\nMany rows straight up and disappeared and frankly I think scared the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight I was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music\nWhen I saw a large white light hovering over a barn and a few minutes later began blanking on and off and following my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's oh and\nThen it stopped and whole Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared on one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times then stop and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with the larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam\nAs I approached the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and none\nOf that same that same year on November twenty Nineteen fifty eight I was standing outside my father's oyster house that faced tucked in river at about five o'clock\nWhen I saw a a a red street lights hanging over the river and there were about Fifteen or the\nCo workers with when we saw three slender shake are shaped objects that we're moving slowly over the river to St Mary's county on the opposite side\nThan a fourth much larger object to approach it seemed to come out of nowhere and it dwarfs the other three UFOs as we watched the large jobs you began expanding from both ends at once\nAnd it quickly rose up into the sky at an estimated what I estimate\nAbout a twenty thousand feet outlook to then they changed to a silver a desk and disappeared tremendous speed and the other obvious followed suit and I had all these reports in the night cap and you know there are [noise] are existence they're\nNineteen fifty eight we didn't have any aircraft that could do that that's correct\nWe sure did\n... did

about Nineteen sixty seven or thereabouts as a matter of fact my wife and Marty and I were there at the time\nAnd uh he came in and uh just introduce themselves we didn't know who he was and he never said how I became interested in it a\n... at that time and at least and is he asked to see a cases he said that he had gotten interested in was wanted to investigate some cases and uh so he went back

is interest was at the very beginning I I don't remember that he may have ... he may have told us but don't\nForget this than almost fifty years ago now yeah\nBecause he committed suicide in Nineteen Seventy one\nAre you sure you did I mean there was a suicide note and everything but how do we know he wasn't just you know I was murdered\nWell he told us are doing or his last visit there it was it after he left our our house after staying there ah\nI'm of overnight a\nAnd it was it wasn't that long a month maybe too before um his body was found we didn't know that he suffered from depression at the time\nYou you didn't show or did he\nKnow it didn't show it at all and it's hard to believe and even told us at the\nTime that he had been followed a buy\n'em on Martin vans didn't have a license

briefcase which he laid down on the on the seat um or or or or or he lay down that popped up against the seat the briefcase was and when he went to pick it up it was empty somebody had exchanged\nSomebody briefcase way the exact same looking briefcase\nAnd uh he said that he had\nBeen a said followed around by an unmarked vans and I'm scared I'm a little bit but he is he's still and and that last visit he said that he was ready to again we're writing his book and just as he said that uh\nHe went back in about a month later he was gone shot him so they say that that's what they say yeah\nEven done a small grants from the office of Naval Research to the phones Denise\nDid he did I think it was a five thousand dollar grant or ten thousand\nWhich is pretty good money back in Nineteen sixty seven\nYeah back in those days it was it wasn't bad that's correct yeah yeah but uh\nHe had um and actually Andrew I helped Andrew\n... quite a bit in writing the book I spent many
