they're still going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven\nAnd a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the ... tower had hundred reporters standing outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation under ... shouted lady\n... remember that yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd they lost like getting a function that they the art but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr do you say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter] which one did again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case\nWould Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got on there and I'll let you get to know that very good\nVery good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it class I loved it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight I might be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus zero plus one plus eight at up to\nUm eleven\nOh that's right and when was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I ... when the when I was one plus one add up to nine plus one plus one\nYep twelve\nNine oh one eleven sorry that's right\nAlthough nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRight up to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\n... you might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I'm saying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice said and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because\nIf you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to ... ruin Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that something else and it does smack of of rice and poisoning\nAnd I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so you know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states for their already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a ships to the ass off to\nSee a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the war\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest\nThe vote I Would tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down to that's gonna be a traumatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I wouldn't be wrapping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're going to already be finished by\n... now you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just devalue wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but I doubt metro call has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that that's what I think it\nHas you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith in or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost the teen years ago you do really\nI Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I

S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner sense\nSince Nineteen eighty six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide actress oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe or the Rhine River is making a comeback to Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations to become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNot what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nEvery little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they\nThought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example than the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email

nationwide tested wireless emergency alert system\n\n\nAnd welcome back Steve Moore I'm with a steep what are the views worldwide about climate change\n[noise] well the uh world leaders are pretty much signed up to this more than a hundred and Ninety world leaders have signed up to this is the most of them signed the Kyoto Protocol in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd um it was I was at a conference at the University of Chicago and they mentioned that the nations of signed up to the Paris accords even\nEven though President Trump has said he's going to it\nDraw a lot of it is kind of a universal thing um but uh you know the uh the members are not living up to their\nTo their uh commitments it's very very tough when you need to uh\nTo impose a things on your nation and you\nAnd you are a half to impose costs on renewable energy and also there's there was this big demand that the world set up to the United nations they wanted a hundred billion dollar annual climate payment to go from the wealthy nations to the\nDeveloping nations a hundred billion annually quite a big amount\nAnd a year and has that has completely collapsed a matter of fact the guy who was ahead of that just resigned this last summer and with the ... with uh the United states cutting its commitment uh they're nowhere near that they're down about four or five billion dollars a year\nWhich isn't there a scandal among some of the scientists who were me you know prove man made climate change with the emails and things like that\nYeah the east the climate gate was called the University of east East Anglia back in two thousand nine\nOr they don't know who ... somebody released thousands of emails either an insider or a hacker\nAnd these emails showed some very bad behavior\nUh there were a uh guys that are ah were saying I'm a don't tell anyone that the United kingdom has a freedom of Information Act\nOr there are people are racing emails uh there were people a trunk Keating a data are there were people trying to you know interview or to influence the peer review process I'm\nJust a just not a tough situation you know and and my thought is by interpretation is that the scientists city saying in by the way this was a this was the primary I mentioned before the climate research unit which is the primary keeper of the world's temperatures\nAre these folks I think we're we're trying to do whatever they could to try and save the planet to try and convince the world if you think the world is going down the wrong track\nOf they were pulling any means to try and do that but they were they were following very very poor a scientific or a procedures\nOkay let's go to the phones now Eric truck driving in Indiana hello Eric\nDon't charge or is there to my child guy how's everybody doing than that you\nJust scared the heck out of my guests\nIraq as to hey buddy a many many years ago the founder of coast to coast art bell and his buddy ... Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] [noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under their call during\nThe day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks in that it flows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so um there was there was a fear though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down it's really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the Keno these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll egg and they'll make\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John yeah\nAh my dad who ah who quiet down I just want to say you were were talking about\nWind bills when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the meal that they had a big fat and it was about a twenty four boy blue\nFlame you know they were were burning off the methane\nGas were asking now why\nDon't you put a generator on that and\nWhat do you know Christianity\nNow come back and they had no no no it's going to cost too much you can have anything out now that can't be the only way they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be born in a methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think

the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like a dimension I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware is a\nGlobal elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and say no doubt this a lot of ... Sandler\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite max that we used to the many years ago we're seeing an animated cartoon\nBut there is a fight I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is\nYou see a former meteorologists he keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zone coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power and can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees\nThat can steer hurricanes they can start hurricanes they can blast thunder head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... went about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\n... some might have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across a and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just said is exactly right I Want to these conservatives it happens to believe that the way that is being gay oh engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the sun well people are so much more\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were told us that they said they were going to back off Kim trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's it's to the point now where you can go to the street and on the stock market on the weather if they didn't want her games that they want to intensify the hurricane through the aid of heart\nAnd on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish I may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing with Trump I'm proud of having it got us out of the climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the wealth of industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd mean China sit there with her sky completely on pollution not paying a dime and do it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to quite old guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to

a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river and when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there was like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd when to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up\nSits there and won't position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later\nHe sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess with this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kids in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited ... rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a\nWilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined and\nNinety percent of it is uninhabited\nSo when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine or the money was right the property was right the people I had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match\nMade in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools the wife is saying the husband was\nAlive and they can you get down more credit card users you know I hear them warm during the boom you're free\nWe do mornings in age you Dan rivers [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nOkay\nWell come back we'll you with us William\nThe abominable snowman the lady from the Himalayas is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account of was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of his vast knowledge of things but time nickel\nAnd they form this unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking\nPartnership they had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in ah the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman a speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they parked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and a Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yesterday and the abominable below\nSnowman I have no idea uh I have a senator since ... book the abominable roll a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the\nFilm is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taking everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep\nDoing what we do a in spite of ... what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast you know uh uh\nWe all tune in because we're hearing things that we can't get in Oklahoma ... nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nUFOs and big could encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the ... falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys got all working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being paid so they were spending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS\nAre using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating\nAround in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the sides of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right\nNight for the ICC well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall on Tuesday is which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own monarch you'll or\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one or the kid says hey what's that and they noticed it in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a you know a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd that got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nRight so that that passing a it was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happened\nNine Ninety nine menu not great meals one great price oh Charlie's\nCase the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw I
