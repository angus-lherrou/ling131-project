and I'm a ... a lot of corny stuff\nUh but those shows used to for a while they travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the the theaters didn't want to give up their eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are flow wall and they would they would buy the theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these uh shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an a and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did have matinees for kids to\n'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out and they would have ... and asked him ghosts made out of a mumps that were ... phosphorus and [laughter] and they would they would uh\nYou know they would have these changes that would be wrapped through the

feeling like I wanted to change the world but had no way to do that and uh I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have been with somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time and the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver\nAll through my\nBody off the motorcycle and\nUm I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and I think there was something in that moment that suggested any way that consciousness is more than just our physical ...\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I laid there and I used my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg\nYou know now I have two sturdy legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience new ... you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good NPR assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet ... I think so I don't really remember them on on it\nBut I've heard tales and ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense\nDrinking\nI drank it and that causes massive pneumonia and\nAlmost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand\nConsciousness somebody once you were wrong\nI guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raise their left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was\nThat I was born in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights a war we spent most of my childhood and then the marsh first places I was in ... Michigan Farmington Hills\nAnd then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven and then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis or Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family\nUm they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nYou're born I really yeah well you\nKnow told me weird cause you must remember there's the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who\nWas ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm going to I'm going to close my eyes and yes you'll remote feeling now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear miss viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your back your my gosh yeah\nWell thank you my friend I preach\nSuited ... really steer you in the direction where you are now um and you get a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of a psychological shows you usually get into the but is this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and there were timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown yeah\nUm well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this you know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job\nAt no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological lens\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is any relationship between the family\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery which you'll remember remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really ... yeah I'm sure\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nDeath experiences above the other side what ... what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA then that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something you know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to\nSo they these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across anything much do ...\n[laughter] every day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures expect\nFrom the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\n\nAnd runners weekday mornings at a news radio five seven when you came yeah [noise]\n[noise] I've never seen a ... more bash district ...

is productive\nI I think can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no Juno gr Mitchell before he passed on\nVery well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes like possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to

on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses that come and go\nExactly giving their own personal testimony based on their experiences\nWe ... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI think so too Dr Merrill Lynch much were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it plays a role but employees with all this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't\nEven now that we have them and yet they're the most important thing that shape their experience and it's like we're walking through life with the colored glasses on and it\nIt shape our experience and so we can't see the thing that lie out side of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware and that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive the other part of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of it functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is something that has intelligent it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in fourth because\nEvery now and cranny and filled with light and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness or something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal that it keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet the spiritual side of all of this\nI think so I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I spent time with Sophia the
