the book the monster a monster book um and at some of 'em like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard band as a as a newscaster ... back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something that couldn't somebody in a costume or\nA as an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called a wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\nOh yeah I actually that was at a place called the kind of chasing central England only about five miles from where I was so now the area very well it's a large area\nLike places around the world that same should be hotspots normal phenomena kind of just saying you know they'll be coming out his window areas where it seems every image for other times\nI'm Jake weird but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news for the post\nUm somebody saying what looked like a humanoid sort of literally flying shoring would be a better way to use the words at high speed you know kind of like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they\nYou know the stories coming out to point platforms in the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect than there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police or the [laughter] I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which is already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI tell people if I don't have on says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um [noise]\nYou know I'm not going to tell people the big four days some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nBut you know [laughter] I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ...\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd I'm I'm for a while in Nineteen Ninety four and it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I've talked about that before a that might be spooky here than the men in black\nAnd and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place uh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now on on this phenomena foreign to men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know go on and the skins live\n... white white um\nUm people talk about how vaccines have this ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talks about when they're in close proximity to them that they fall and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black of turned up in homes right have to pay for using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe the ... the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits walk\nIn and you know I'm asking it into context ... with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um\nUm humans and helicopters that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nUh pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\nWell yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... nations you know you've got a really weird lungs and exploit couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain there is a power line with the men in black where there's\nNo doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for their mind they but I think it's a very small cats agree versus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was what I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the ... over the years agencies may actually unemployed the legends of the men in black as a means to cover their tracks in other words the maybe paper within governments who know that the men in black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them\nFrom using the legend the motel have as a means to to threaten and quiet papal who who've I may not want to have them talking about cases so the government might actually not know who the men in black really are and I don't think they do fully\nThat sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction wiles what the government doesn't want you to\nLatest book or whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on

[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back we're talking with Dick Redfern or you know there's an old joke about paranoia paranoia ... about something along the lines of just because you're paranoid that doesn't mean someone doesn't really following you around it's sort of the the the inspiration for this new book or yours top secret alien abduction piles you talk about uh the world in which we live where\nMass surveillance is sort of a given now right\n[noise] well unfortunately in of course you know subsequent generations of growing world wherever I've never known any different\nPaper the night before the Internet age will remember it was sort of well why some islands so we have now and\nYou know I think that's what I mean I'm fortunate things for future generations it's going to be helping normal thing for probably accept it as well\nOr you know you mentioned in in in the book about the idea of the fear that people used to have that maybe the government's going to talk us into getting a computer chip stuck under our skin and then they can follow us and it'll be for all the good reasons you know for our health and wellbeing and\nAll kinds of ways but in fact they would be able to monitor everything we do everything about us we already have a a surveillance devices like that we all carry them or their cell phones yeah\nUm but the idea that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would put time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs thinks that that's the word alien abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what ... alien abductions are all about that that idea which seemed preposterous but too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote a book which actually facial oh vacation guy to November people can already got it [laughter]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret abduction falls is because over the years I collect a number of official documents on abductions which are painted classified true the fame Information Act in the um the U.S some primary I was in a position where\nIt actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the ready to leave us it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with a guy to showing how falls or be put together now I start the book actually with the contact a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies\nDo ah put together falls on people who claim to have had I Lived in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them had FBI falls open on them one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on communism\nAnd I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... she was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contacts have people now in the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September of sixty one I'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn ... wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weird um I don't feel writes the\nYou know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd they get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly striking\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning to back to I Am an essay was driving the vehicle to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the ... started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew ... what's\nIntriguing is that they the British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised in security services there was sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the the the they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild ... to with the with the ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled by the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of\nSounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO come down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of felt strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact ... and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does follow them around it takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientist studied UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going round people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books with salt\nI'm On a ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn ... um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens\nBusts the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination tangle and I'm\nOften thirty minutes bass the hours of the time\nYou know I Know they

losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and and combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a real one um\nThey do seem to be tied to both capital mutations and um the Eileen abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government\nAnd had the names tend to [noise] excuse me one was named acting Lewis named ... anyway she took him there and she never could turn out to the parents were or anything like that\nSo she took him in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got into their teens\nI noticed that they didn't have any hair on their head on or anything but it wasn't a bond movie where\nThey had moved out the ... and ... she took them then they went to school and we were fourteen years old they a duck out of school because they love each stream the calendar as a matter of fact that ... a built a cabin Adams there's little farm\nRate my late ... and um they um you know like you say very intelligent boys both with twins whether any of that went on when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old got a very bad up cut on his own detour forming action that\nWell they couldn't pin local hospital and a\nA a felt like they will have the lead transfer you can cook it lost so much blood but when they took his money tight they couldn't find any type of match anyway and they check to a place and then they checked\nHis twin brother and he had the same lead type\nSo that they had to use his blood transfusion lean rated went back to the ... nothing happened\nAnd they went into the army they drafted in young the Nineteen forties to when when they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and am when a cabinet was the vet there\nAnd they grew in town maybe once a month for supplies and so forth but then they had set up a ...

running out of time here would not only do\nThey um they like I say I swam and some people want to have to see him because they hadn't seen in town any of that they were missing they couldn't find anywhere and the only thing they could find was the rock it shatters the cabin with some high a good thing or something for them wrong\nAnd they called a professor at college women very you came out like that and he couldn't figure them out in the event or they were missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sure that story I'm going to get next to take on that Thanks John appreciate your call Nick you're that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have heard a\nKind of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was known but um you know what I have a grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole ... took off\nThat that were abduction like experience whose body fat in other words it's not just something that began with a bacterium bony heel case\nIt's just it's just a case of trying to find the earlier ones and very often that does come through you know what a family member decides to to contact someone like me you know and and share a story that goes back to\nYou know the Chinese or the ... live out one so I'm you know I think we can push they the barriers back significantly you know when it comes to when this whole phenomenon actually kicked off\nTrying to get one more call in the first time caller Josh in Toronto hey Josh you're on the red burn\nYour evening gentlemen how you doing All right I Do on your mind\n... yeah basically has been looking on my mind it was a Nineteen fifty nine case of nine rushing students hikers who went missing will not missing but it looked like they were attacked and according to many people in Russian uh yesterday I don't know if your guest has any conclusion to that story was uh\nBut I Am ... house yet I outlaw yeah\nYeah the death of a pie stories and interesting one you know it was um [noise]\nYou know a bunch of ah of Russian people um you know work together with friends and um\nDied under very odd circumstances and I'm\nReminded him ... to this day I mean there's everything from like violent big foot type creatures attacked and killed them\nOr you have sort of Russian military experiments UFO activity and despite all the research and the father of several books have been written on the subject there's no sort of one hundred percent consensus on on what actually happened it's it remains\nYou know ... but there are a lot of weight aspects to this story which I guess unfortunate though you know we'll never really know the answer I think it's going to remain a mystery unfortunately\nNeck I don't know how when you sleep but you are you're a as a prolific an author as I Know in the world or any one I Want to talk about anything else you got coming up we got about a minute left\nUm well as a self you know that's the new books a top secret abduction falls that's the one I'm sort of a\nYou know promoting now I'm I'm not as I said the reason I wanted to ride it was because yes they're paid a lot of books on abductions but not above that sort of actually addresses\nFrayed information files on everything from abductions to missing time to black helicopters you know ... presents and new\nAngle on the abduction issue if you like\nThank you Nick it's always great to be here when the urge people to take a look at the new book and also the monster book it's a great one to have your library if

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this issue you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch grief for doing it\n[laughter] you know if I'm yeah how do I get away get away with it from you know a lot of people and\nCultural studies or people who are interested in studying religion or yeah we do we do get a path to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nExperiences whatever whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privileged to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of how my interest and that's really ... how the book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality but as you know this on ... and new direction by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it would be sort of fantastic scientific ideas have let 'em have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents isn't any than actual experiments and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a belief in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\nSummoning a around the western world but interesting spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remained strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nI guess would be called spiritual beliefs they pretty high numbers in America I'm leaving and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation in traditional religious congregations are silly Asian and traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about this how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that\nPeople seem to have a very robust sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like dark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi versus thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and I wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard times too late normally George it's too late [laughter]\nYeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort of that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given day or a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it it hurts to even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kind of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the in the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and\nMaybe I can just say worried about that for for the listeners tonight yes you know I'm going to get\nAnother demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimensions three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or dimensions there's there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions [noise] a a direction and space or a dimension in space that's different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line as one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object\nHas three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else\nAnd that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these

J. B. and\n\n[noise]\n\nWe're back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific views came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah he and his wife is quite a story um but you're right they're they're ... and there's many others in the book sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like habit being raised religious and find the time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and [noise] his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turn to the you know fantastic scientific concepts like hard to mention another new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am an incumbent mentioned story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nFalls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make All right and the situation is he he races map addict and geometry as a kind of a he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nThat the dreaming south can somehow lift itself up off of our normal world um and peek into other parts I'm In the timeline or for other areas on the timeline so the dreaming self\nThe dreaming consciousness has a kind of a freedom\nThat uh that our our regular everyday consciousness doesn't have any and he uses a lot of\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a he has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these power and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and he writes this I just up in a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that than happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job where they see out to be in some other reality and then they come back and this one side of audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well also in that chapter sex um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a fact of that book but she talks about time slips and time travel um and so on and some of her books [noise] so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time it is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we had a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that\nEinstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe\nThat could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block prior we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics [noise] um and and this is actually discussions Scott defending wants to look at it it's just after my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I'm the only laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYeah you're right you're right and it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices on and so on [noise]\nUm so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow lift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions and one temporal dimensions\nDreaming stuff he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moments and Don believe that um you know using a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space philosophers there I'm that's what he believed was happening some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we could talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and have you thought everybody everybody's sleeping self had this degree of freedom and he he also believe that everyone if they haven't kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and when they fall he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that if everyone did it they would be able to see that all of the all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and past events I'm sort of mixed up together well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it a that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences\nWant to talk about say onto a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before might fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for visible dimensions by Christopher

ending\nAfter all those valleys station news radio five Seventy doubled you Katie and\n\n[noise]\n\nA crisp white so tell me this in the example of flat land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world and pulls them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached down and grab us and pull it up so we can understand uh the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimensions and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had\nYou know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional hum and as being that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the fear that that and and I'm an avid spoke at flat land so\nYeah people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects than ... entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying that science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nYou know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experienced like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics I have different voices in the book I'm\nTalking about what the meaning of\nThese events are ... and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experience with them and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concept to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right to have these dreams for him to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he\nDidn't actually go to the Bible that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went through he went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um well I mean\nHumans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time ... would be an example reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a\nRemote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been given Vonn earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity on and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nAfter your dreams and you know in the sixties and other times you know Americans psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another round and\nIn other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the chance to to reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely are all different all different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about ... viewing and other uh paradise ... ... has\nHigher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land from it because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right fighting around the surface of your desk they don't they know a length and wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ...
