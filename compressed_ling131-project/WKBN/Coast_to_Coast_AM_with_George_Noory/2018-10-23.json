O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping cash is ah we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um\nThe the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere and we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed orange that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the soil because it's been ... and it would out gas and it was thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much ... fresh water in those places there is in North America\nOceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would strike to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick CEO to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient\nAnd in in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara foreign within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technology is we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country but the Martians\nAre they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches those I ss and they bring us back a while most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well uh here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch company is my guest the Chinese though because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and ah because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the ... and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um hold\nOn Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on the coast to coast they\nSign up no go zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to ... um\n\n\n\n\n[noise] to this we do sports history or back in Nineteen sixty four for the famous wrong way run the Vikings Jim marshals picked up a fumble and runs sixty six yards in the wrong direction for safety still to this day\nIt is the NFL number one blooper [noise] this weekend Nineteen Seventy the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers leave their first home game losing to the San Diego rockets one ten Ninety nine\nThis weekend Nineteen Seventy one Texas Stadium over in the Dallas Cowboys the\n...

Dan rivers\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast Robert Zubrin with us we'll get to calls in the seconds rubber we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space or how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] [noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm\nIs about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven [noise] um I mean in terms of manned space flight a you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit\nBeyond that I mean they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nDo they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one third the time at one tenth the cost and if\nUh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with understanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd uh so if who wants Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right now you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is a ... in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons\nOr the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well that one weapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but\nIt is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just the uh the rich ticket to go to Mars well [noise] um\nIt's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and\nAlso I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go and um\nYou know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportions rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nAh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air with only a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a ... you know the next new kid on the block me a a you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because you know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America like uh Europe yet on the American Indian or\n\nOK well there yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life\nAnd for people to say ah for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because um what we get to the American Indians was wrong because they were\nPeople right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American\nTo nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no buys in\nHerds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about the course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance mine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nWe gave them the news at ... news radio five

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh\nHad quarter laugh a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo is German technology that help the Soviets to write\nWell they they captured some vie to split\nA as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers\nSoviets captured a lot of the two rockets but they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWhat's amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those critical time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have ... you some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums\nYes ah you know and so you know like the Apollo\nMovie or just now the moody last man for not last man first fan\nFirst myth while it may be the last ... now what\n... yeah well I think it's pretty good movie by the way I just saw it um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nWell no they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\nThat this movie some people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know Neil Armstrong relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the teams with the exit teen and the Gemini in Chino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed\nAnd just the and the spectacular nature of of this thing and this this this and the daring of America at that time and um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes so\nLet's go to David the Salem ... said David go ahead sir\nI didn't mean to you both and thanks for taking my call George ... thing um okay so it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago it was really played into my question we you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and things on Mars and already might stay in life but do we have any plans are there any theories on\nPossibly can relate in an atmosphere stimulating of life's just learning environment um drilling holes that were trapped gas is eating the the atmosphere with and we have Orange County areas her plans for that what\nWe discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of costs a lot of atmosphere that out gas out of the soil\nI I've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can settle Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that transform it in the way that you are a suggesting because marshals wants to warm and wet planet which means by the way it had a thick atmosphere\nAnd um it could be made so again\nAnd you believe we must go to Mars don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh\nI Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there is an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nThe port Arnie in Roseville, California go ahead Arnie\nYeah Hi I'm ... I'm ... and ah I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you in Anchorage privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars\nOr the planet I mean are you looking at just allowed to be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can or are you are you in the government should be more involved in the ... how\nA position of real poverty as it was would be nice if we ever got to the point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left so\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copied us because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese government that they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good idea to some of the bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas\nImmigrants will flock there those places will grow and they'll become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my friend always great talking to

clinical does get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghosts in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so I actually I actually got a day job and then I studied the parents psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I've spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that\n[laughter] how'd you do by the way that's not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight which was that was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just social studies for what he was an overview of what you been doing it\n[noise] well um [noise] you know I uh I have a degree in Paris psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with the goes studies and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes way encounters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as hallucinations interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life ghostly encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters um it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats have been picking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting first hand account of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere\nAnd then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my I took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts\nAnd I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book well\nThen you bring to do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you just\nGot to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article a kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded to brag about what the grossly experience might be for real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's environmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them what do they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes so that's a inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ghostly counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy\nOr I'm sort of 'em are coming in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a uh tell a path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of a ghostly encounter\nHow important then is the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ghosts of encounters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um you know emotional distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it\nAnd then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to\nSend a distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is like the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there was a an operation of my aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed away\nRight on time that I had that right and I and I and I think that that you\nCan sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll thing ah to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot\nResearch out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affects certain people more than others\nAnd this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions um there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people\nYou know I Know they know

and the mom saw this woman dressed in the future of the ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even skier due to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit\nI had an experience I'm\nA I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio and um [noise]\nOh one morning a you know my wife was out of town and I'm One morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon\nAnd I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside so I'm like yeah well you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it\nYou know and I'm like you know and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door of the dog went outside and the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and somehow um you know drowned in their lives\nYou know it's dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signal sent to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kinda like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many paranormal experiences occur Brandon because the person who died comes back never had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have to do with easing or coke\nYou know with the psychological injury like the death of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with death all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nThe the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of hill this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use conventional me you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are sort of stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think the thing I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debt spouse one month after their death um so that's a pretty high number eighty percent\nIt's huge yeah yeah\nYeah and and perhaps the bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way the\nProcess emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the deceased couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards revolution and I ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it could come out of it goes the encounter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's it's not a negative and demons and things like\nA brand and what have you concluded about the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about them\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them you know when they put 'em there's there are some cats out there\nSpecifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like that I Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing F F MRIs jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for which we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you you know I might get\nPoked with a pen and to me it's a

colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in it than most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't they do and I was really shocked you know you gotta sit back and got away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's\nThere's still some colleagues you'll come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that but the response has been pretty positive it's something that's really fast\nAnd it's I mean it's a mystery and it's been intriguing for human since you know the dawn of time\nYou know does this go stuff [noise] um so ... you know it's\nNot that bizarre or out of context them anything\nAnd listen I mean parents college he is a subset of psychology at the legitimate discipline just like social psychology and neuro psychology\nIt's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for those of us in the field it's\nYou know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you ... you don't have the answers\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nPoultry guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says where objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on and those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're um in distress um you know to me it's hard to\nFathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that\nI really don't know the answers to that um so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seem to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMission to give us another story\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning a soft glowing light appeared next to my bad the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre wasn't I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child standing my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of telepathy or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional chefs related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witnessed I'm the typical soft glowing light operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or ... phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message tell a path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the wife may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also bags that question you know was this did this happen after he died where did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I mean it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all things electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but\nYou know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well and the animals she does show you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone who's walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a Pulitzer guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic fields are always present as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter\nOn the other side of that there was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with\nWith ghosts and go see encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president you know if a if EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher [laughter] um so you\nKnow energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes way encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know\nUh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up for I felt the room felt energized are like that there was it felt like a of electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri to get things started Jay's\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that we're [noise] [laughter] I ... in walls and blue suit and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in ... you\nKnow I I don't think so you you know and and then this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us\nYou know like a TV um I I see the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there's some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in in sometimes that falls into an earth ... spirit but I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it's it's it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments\nHand picked up a good be
