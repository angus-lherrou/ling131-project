asked whether whether anybody had remote viewed Jesus was he on this earth was he the son of God what are you know if anything\nI'm this is Len yes Lynn oh I had started a a a do war story here uh I had been doing the bad guys for for weeks and weeks and I went into the director and I should look\nI I Believe are based on a remote during my experience is that uh the UFOs a real uh let me say that up front I have not seen any evidence that there aliens associated with UFO phenomena of not seen direct proof of that\nHowever are within the context of aliens I Would have to say that are also based on my experiences um I Believe that there are a entities that people would perhaps call Ian\nBut that doesn't get guarantee that there extraterrestrial they could be um and they could be essentially time travelers a extra dimensional a projections that sure almost anything\nAnd I don't think we possess pushing proved to say one way or the other what they might get an answer Joe\nI'm very however all of you agree there is certainly something out there other than us\nWell this is Joe Joe I'm ... this isn't a new issue are this is this has been around for two thousand years that we know of\nAnd it will continue to be around because those are simply experiences that are that people are having in a while we may not be able to say ... very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be properly investigated or or looked at\nWhat happens unfortunately is that a lot of the data is a is mixed with this information or it's collected improperly or poorly\nIn we wind up with some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nOr are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nA generally so yes uh well here's Paul um the the biggest ... of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might have disclosed the existence of some human source that we have you know and and a\nHuman outside him at risk or you know uh there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved is what we're doing that that is sensitive to end are important to ah American security\nWould agree with that\nYou made a rather startling statement one of you or that it deems you felt disclosed some classified material before it's time oh well this is Lynn ...\nI'm not only on a on a few uh T. V. shows uh I think there's one called the other side or something like that and a radio shows but also um\nI was down in Atlanta one time a working with a student and I had the chance to meet a person named uh Courtney Brad ... who was going to put out a book or this book was about the Stargate project\nAnd he asked me to take a a\nCopy of the manuscript that he had and read it and then the first chapter of the manuscript never remember everything was still classified highly classified I'm In the first chapter of the manuscript was the list of names of all of the viewers\nOh I went back and I said I said Courtney you can't you can't publish this and uh and uh you know if you do they'll they'll confiscate your book or something in in any way that got him to take that first chapter out mhm\nOh I ask him where did you get this information and he said well I got it from Ed\nOh\nWhen I was a kid watching you know the old world war two movies and all I knew that the absolute worst\nTrees and that any agent could ever do\nWas give the names of the other agents or I mean you you you bite the cyanide pill and die before you do that and yet here was the entire list or\nFor the purpose of being published while this was still a a a classified thing now the reason that upset me so much was because um of another incident where it at a meeting had gotten up and told what I had done a\nAgainst Hussein and uh I called him on the phone and I should add\nThese are crazy people with guns and uh I've got a family here and he just blew it off well the only purpose I could find for giving those names to coordinate to publish in that book while it was still classified\nOh deals with the idea of targeting for remote viewing\nOr if you have a name basically you have an address and a the a history of Russian\nAu pair of psychology has been more aimed at remote influencing\nThan a remote viewing or data collection and uh I saw and I could still find no other reason for giving that information to coordinate then to\nHave something happened to us and uh that upset me very much and uh uh I stayed around ... court in a not only took the first chapter out but also deleted it from his computer ah I wanted to make absolutely certain that was completely gone\nLook guys were at the top of the hour anybody here have to bail out or can you stick around a little bit\n[noise] I can stay on for a while I'll ...

target in this area or would have been the Roswell episode and I've got a a person vaccine me from Los Angeles saying uh somebody must have tackled that one has anybody looked at Roswell in it so ... what have you determined\nUh I can I can respond to that first I guess this is Joe okay Joe I'm I I had a private client who actually targeted me against Roswell and uh at the time of course was totally blind to the actual target and uh what I produced was essentially\nA very accurate description of the location\nThat was being targeted and Roswell which was the police crash site uh there were some indications that there probably was an incident there but it did not involve an alien craft it involves a\nA possible ... collusion between uh uh some earth earth bound traffic and probably involved some materials that were sensitive [noise]\nEnhance or then of course the story about the weather balloon\nYes I ... the data I had not specifically match a weather\nBalloon but uh it it did a indicate that there was probably any that but it was probably not a ... a alien associated\nSorry Joe I'm facts where you from Orange County aren't in reading ... book mind track which by the way I felt was a great book he talks about a stage in which he sees creatures or ghosts spirits\nAnd uh the person wants to know does everybody who remote views eventually get there\n[noise] uh in in regard to what what their referencing are uh some chapters in an era where I was discussing a my interaction with what you Michael\nThat is that a ... this took place essentially as an experience outside of remote doing All right I Want to make that very clear all while these these may have been a personal experience on but I think is balance [noise] ah they they were not the separation was not obtained a\nSevere um oh if you don't have um I I Believe it's my personal belief um\nBased on Nineteen years of participation in the project and in the remote doing that I've done\nIt's my personal belief that um that we are by nature are essential existing in two worlds a one foot physical and one foot in the spiritual and to ignore the experiences from a spiritual side would be taught them out to cutting off the left leg so to speak\nRight now I hear well then here's another good question other than the remote viewing of\nChrist um Kent any of you or do any of you aside from your personal religious beliefs are in in in the context of remote viewing ... or is it possible to confirm the fact that there is life beyond the physical\nI I I Will answer that uh this is Joe again I'm In my opinion yes uh\nBut it's not life as we know the physical and it's it's obviously something else fright and uh I I Believe that uh we do have frequent interactions with or what might be termed as as entities or spiritual being\nAnd that uh they have profound impact on us as a spiritual\nSpiritual beings ourselves in that those types of experiences are have be because of the profound impact of them have exactly the same effect as if you were run over by a Mack truck in the world so they should be paid attention to 'em and that's up to each individual as to what they do it at\nAll right this is for all three of you are in the process of learning or are in the process of remote viewing is there any danger to the remote viewer\n[noise] this is Paul I'm I don't think so I'm In my entire time with the program I never experienced myself or heard of anyone else experiencing anything that would be considered dangerous\nI Know there are claims out there to the contrary but uh um you know I I just don't know where that's coming from\nA well a dangerous to the psyche of the remote viewer in other words that you might see things for example that uh uh would drive a person over the edge\n[noise] uh this is land could I jump in here for a second\nYes um [noise]\nFor each person when you establish a sort of contact between your conscious and subconscious mind sometimes there are\nThings that your subconscious unconscious have been waiting for Twenty years to say to each other and there's a period of time generally when a person gets very sensitive the very a\nA reactive to things uh fly off the handle easily and so forth uh but that gets over with a any real danger that comes to a person I think is basically\nCaused by the fact that the subconscious is harboring a danger that is then let loose\nUm I have never had any or even actually known any person who has had a a a remote view in session where the session itself or the target itself a had a\nA danger to the fewer oh I think what you carry into the learning process for remote viewing may be a danger to you but that dangers been there all along anyway I'd ... I'd like to add something\nTo that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said I've never had a bad experience and remote going\nBut I Would like to underscore the fact that uh this is a very interesting um experience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that\nAre that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct\nOr it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with\nAndrews remote influencing is possible that would have been an obvious or a major ah project or would you all agree\n[noise] a little ahead oh I I I Would agree except that I haven't seen any evidence that the Chinese are in fact doing that so it's sort of a moot question and I'm not sure how anyone would would evaluate the results of that\nThere have been there's a power there have been a lot of reports about the Soviets having been involved in that in the past um but it's mostly kind of rumors and and and such a again no evidence of course I think of this nature it'd be hard to prove any way\nBut there were some interest in what wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nAnd so on and there are All right gentlemen hold tight we'll be right back to you\nGathering of eagles I'm calling in leading Buchanan Joe ... and Paul Smith all involved in projects\nDarn good for the U.S government which ran for Twenty years of using your tax dollars\nTo remote view\nAnd listening to our drill somewhere inside there might be drink coast to coast am run march twenty Nineteen nineties\nWeekday afternoon news radio Seventy yelling you ...

remember the generals double bind the commander of ins calm whatever that is was chairman of the board of side check when it went public in Nineteen eighty nine\nOr would that would that affect anybody's comment with regard to the release of a classified material\nOr I Would ask if it is a exonerate ... at times oh I mean does this mean that he didn't do what he did Iowa to that\nThis is Joe I'm ... one of the one of the normal procedures for for\nFinding something else is to um\nTo claim that uh someone else was already told you and then it's just a matter of elevating the information we're getting it from someone else um this was a a pretty common ploy and it's used by the media representatives many times in newspaper articles and things of that nature\nBecause someone else said it doesn't make it true and it certainly is no valid reason for violating a a video that an officer mates or the security that someone is committed to in a dams case um\nI Would rather not comment directly on him [noise] but\nUh I I don't choose valid reason for what he may or may not have a\nYeah I I'd like to kind of when a little bit on its defense here um\nI think trees is too strong a term here a treason implies that you're providing a damaging information to unknown enemy or it didn't do that um he was\nYou know in the various ah Venus and when she released whatever information they did um\nHe was perhaps you know I don't know what his motivation was but he he didn't intend for that information necessarily to be used by an enemy or or uh or someone who wish to harm the United states you know of course by releasing it publicly you lose control of that information\nAnd you don't know what you saw it will be put to well that still doesn't constitute treason and\nWell do you help people like this ah ...\nAh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and ah for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them partially because I Want to cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity\nThat oh if they will get the investigating officer to\nContact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nAlright ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case the gave your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no I think for many years to cater to clone\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now we worked a case not too long ago last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our ah\nOur session a Mel Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding\nA I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lean okay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nOr do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com\nNo let me also say that right at the present time we are heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so uh\nOh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable a west or the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nI yes\nGood morning my credit for that kind of lost track of all they care to cover up a story that\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nAre absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote view and is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong out of your respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing is well this is one reason why I never\nUm a\nTask the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view ...\nLay the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly the more you learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encouraged\nMe incorrectly ... and a dishes my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder ... just\nA you know the hundredth McKee if you're a just a almost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire

doubled you Katie in [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county will is here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford been so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween\nIt really does have um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get state panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kinda stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nAnd ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids do not just trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you\nExactly exactly I was just such an offensive\nAs like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all\nAnd you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted for but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember it was always go X ray or candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also\nI'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often are actually at the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything and the candy and the answer was almost always know\nIn for something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't\n[laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yesterday he can see all the stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily stricter the British Isles\nUh and then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nI'm ... and in fact I tell you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the the trials they have ... they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly ... for for for many years I'm\nA court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know\nBoys they'll hire you if you'd actually have families coming together to make a kid's costume\n... and what you find is that the first\nUm the in the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in about the Eighteen seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's it's big it's become commercialized for for better and for worse\nAnd this was when you start getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on us no good question you know I think that um you know ... ... the Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's\nIt's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each it raised with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken too far\nOr in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep\nIt keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a ghost you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you got to say that he was like this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about any part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and really we tonight\nNever missed a detail issue or just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com\n[laughter] what's new day on the free I our radio\nFor decorating the house or just setting the scary movies our pumpkins by the pilot has Joe ... with the labor is why when you know after day\nIn swing make sure you break out all our great video game party playlists whether you're at home or the stadium knew I our radio ... collection check him out\nMean you're the one on one time is right\nHistory behind him finally recording ...\nI wrote my first single ever with Christopher I'm we we've been friends for the last five years and I've always been such a huge fan and a huge supporter and when I heard him sing crash and burn I was like oh this isn't like the the sad country songs singing crust that within that I've been listening to for five years with like this is crazy like what is that if you ever wake up one day and decide that you don't\nFor an artist to go in and try to recreate and make your own [noise]\nBut we somehow managed to go in there and I\nWe had to lower at like twelve kids because I Can't sing near size crafts but um you know Dan and Jesse just did such a great job producing the track and\nAnd uh you know getting the confidence video and and now when I hear it's just it feels that feels like I was in the room riding and that's how close that song is my heart and um [noise] so I Am so thankful that he let me you know cut the\n[noise]\nGotta feeling sorry for the war in the house\nDavid you're either has overcome a severe issue of whether the light the light bulb went on and I started\nTo research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough they made me feel so much better I can let me tell you one thing\nThe product war and not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me like ...\nOr how [noise] just a better way carnivores bills every spring back into my body taken a while but you know ...

Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's or I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the\nWill of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it\nBut I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep and you know a mall haunted house reached out and grabbed a crook somebody or whatever and there are some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean are they mentioned before you know so and what not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of sometimes conservative cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if you drink some way and if you ask them you know if you told them about some some goat creature that you know the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about one part of their own view\nUm and and again you know the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a feeding and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course when you look at this point to a team\nYou know ... not fair for which to live\nUm and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a coping influences right so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's\nOf the more obviously comes up every every year coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in Nineteen eighty with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in a ... in a couple of years back up at the heart to see James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a hold of it if it weren't you weren't strictly prohibited anyone using a ... board will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so\nFirst thing I mean the the owners were so so concerned that using the word you board was going to open up you know do you want to ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is\nIt's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... that a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party\nSo the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from Holly and this is our way into the harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights and the ah we were um and I grew up\nIn Louisville, Kentucky and one of the

B. yet [noise]\n[noise]\n\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here\nWill is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nThen that means that by definition their their material because you know sound is audio waves and and you know ... you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing Adia waves and so\nSo that's that means that they they can be recorded\nUm on on your audio taping and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used as a tack ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field detectors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved the you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nAnd that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science\nOr in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think goes I mean there are cool\nWhat why what what is it\nWell you know I I I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know this million dollar question right I mean you even even among the hunter and believers across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you don't have a theory that there is something that's going on in\nThe you know with some murder murder tragedy that was recorded the stone and treating the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional means other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinion you know problematic for ghost research right because\nGoats can't be both in our dimensional spirit\nAnd you know an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder\nYou know the dead so so ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problems so I\nI don't know what goes obviously they're not meant Scientifically Proven I think that my my best guess if the real would be basically Couric explanation that would be there some sort of fears of the debt that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for widows for Willis weaned so thank you for giving us the information\nYou have in fact that I

consider these things as I say I don't particularly think as a person running rounding ... times how the moon but I'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of the ...\nAre telling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built county and the ... century I took place called ... calling a inflicts them it was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up\nA and the king was stunned and he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge and the night it's a fabulous name what's

this cattle grazing it's looked slum where they'd be in the old so to lake but I don't have much in the sediments and everything is produced\nSort of fertile ground very fertile ground well yeah yeah I don't think that that's why the cows and not race officers in it you know the first in the Nineteen seventies once again now spoke to this guy numerous times and recorded it sightseeing\nOr you know and he did a bit of poaching in the Nineteen seventies you know catching has and ... and places that he shouldn't have been on private land and um it was a place called Fox ... in grading Dale which is\nEight miles from flicks than any still lives in Britain Dale and it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with a friend said need noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what my roommates net to catch the rub it in the has the other game small game\nAnd it was ... ... is ... so to Britain ... born and bred and he's with pretty ragged him out to ... as\nYou said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing a sudden there was still a bit of snow on the ground you could see so to Roosevelt and as you look you know if it was the uh the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us if ... was doing the poaching in the daytime\nSo there's a large hedge hole forms and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall\nAnd he will he sought to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and his peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said he thought he was a young hopes it meant halls so HBO to bless each other for a while you'll also first\n... believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small

said I went to the edge of them to try and get a fence stave it's\nJust to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world or what quite incredible um you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county\nAnd if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the beast of bombs to drain the featured in the u._k. papers quite often\nAnd you said you are supposed to be aware of that was sort of going the ... into the sea six miles from where I'm ... now so we got this where we'll type creature reported that moving along the coast and if you go for the
