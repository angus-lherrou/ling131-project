to do anything they did not many but\nHistory shows that that it had a as above all last night alone I ... and it was going against certain groups\nCertain opposition a boat like thirty six or eight thirty eight can you hear all compare what the Democratic Party is doing to the Christians are late white males are\nThat's going on today could you compare that you know not as you know a ballot as it is right now I mean I've seen things going on it or\nWhere you're at and it's you know ... and I was just wondering if you could say the parallels\nIt you know I could tell you that now I don't think we're seeing the Democratic party doing anything not see\nI I'm sure that the I'm sure the Democratic party or people who are representing a the the left wing will say that everything the Republicans are doing or not see I mean calling out of Nazi or calling Nazi here and not see there's kind of it's the God when argument and it certainly dumped pills everything into a soup of not of nothing this and it makes it less effective\nBut I Will tell you that's about all this oil no but I Do like let me finish I'll tell you where it's going well you have a mayor in this town that is corrupt and deserves to be arrested in fact today I came to work wondering how I could organize a group to arrest them he needs to be arrested or on many reasons many reasons he's arrested because he\nIs not holding together the rule of law in this in the city not at all uh\nIt's it's like you know the same as little as a write without the violence but we still have the same\nKind of their employees you know I don't know is saying that you know a seller before last they shut a major bridge going across the river to lift as\nWell what we do when we have okay well we have groups that are uh basically blocking traffic a and there and there are abusing people and the police look on the police are told not to do anything so their their arms and tied their hands are tied when it came on the ice or when there would be a\nIce takeover here the icy takeover in ah Oregon\nSame thing happened in fact they were saying that what he did was\nUnconstitutional in and would be a and I think there is somebody actually suing him for what happened there but we also have a governor here and that is very corrupt she's actually a better a lot of things that she's doing right now but in my opinion uh would would probably weren't arrest as well\nFor some reason we have two very corrupt leaders\nA mere Portland it's a corrupt leader\nAnd the mayor in a in a new governor of Oregon and super corrupt\nAnd both of them are in power right now\nAnd so even if they're gonna wait it out to the election but in my opinion [noise] somebody's got to be done sooner than later [noise] and uh after and this is why we're in the position we're in right now and I you know I don't normally I don't normally talk about local politics I leave that up to a guy that I work with the Mars Larson is amazing with that stuff these conservative very staunch\nConservative but still you have a handle on Portland politics and a lot of ways\nAnd I keep telling them every day what are you going to do\nTo get people to start talking about arresting our mayor Ted Wheeler and tell him look you don't you don't allow this type of thing and a lot of crime to run in this in this in the city and I think that uh you know it's being well known across the country now his reputation and what he's doing and what has been happening here in Portland, Oregon\nThey said before prepared for anything anything can happen in anything is happening right now so as I say it's best to be prepared I'm not calling for civil war I'm not asking are running the streets I'm asking\nPhilip your hand and scream and yell all I'm saying is be prepared for anything will be back [noise]\nHis online banks for closing on us they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the

there is any go hog wild and be all violent and crazy on on Facebook or on Google but they're looking at tone and once again once again this brings to mind this social credit score\nWill look at tone will have a heat scale will will run the site to the algorithms in the heat scale and we'll see just how it measures up in a bit and we turn out of the day turns out the ... algorithm to you have a

these hints\nAbout war civil war and license for violence and the motives of course getting what you want\nThe motive\nYou know we want so many people to go out and vote but we don't want certain people to win and if they win will keep being on civil to one another if they if they lose maybe there'll be more violence\n\nAnd of course the media says about Trump when he said about the GOP violence of Georgia wow that three expected you know he's a he's a fear mongering narcissistic blah blah blah blah blah blah you do that anyway but then Hillary\nClinton says consequences be damned we need to have incivility until we get what we want enter claim of civility could return when Democrats have power is this measure the ends justify the means\n\nMeanwhile she said this one we've had Republicans are being shot stabbed docks be mailed a a rice in powder\nRun out of restaurants sent death threats and yet she says we got to be an civil until we get what we want well who's giving the chilling response is right now\nSome guy I guess or maybe two hundred pound bomb but you want to detonate on election day one guy said he was going to explode it was reported the news Eric Holder's basically said I'll probably the quote somewhere Eric Holder the streets we said we need to kick up talking about the Republicans we need to kick them when they're low\nBecause the words of war\nAnd I know people don't want to you know want to they want to admit to it but they are so what do we do well you've got to be inciting civil war which many people were saying I'm doing why don't we take the ... these people are making these statements including President Trump\n\nYou know we we stop blaming the Russians for meddling now we're doing it wide open\n\n... or there's meddling going on the media is meddling Hillary Clinton is battling and now Donald Trump says well the that's meddling too\n\nThat's voter manipulation in my opinion is motor manipulation\nRegardless of what you think of your president regards what you think of Hillary Clinton that is voter but it'd be only should\n\nSomeone who just sit down with him and say you know you just did what you said about your ... your manipulating the boat Hillary when you said that the Christian on the ... year many people even vote\nI'm sure they don't care\nI'm sure many of you don't care that I'm telling you this because you're

all these people have said they stay all these things and that oh wait I didn't but there is the part that they're creating already believe that that is what they're passionate\nWell it's like what Sarah said the dog whistle with the dog was it like\nYou know they say it and like you said the people that are radical here at me leave they go oh yeah that's what we do we keep being a you know getting in people's faces until we when you see they don't say that the Trump things they oh Trump advocating violence\nNo this is ... this is something we're not doing but it is it's dog whistling their dog whistling their people to kick them when they're low their dog whistling their people to be an symbol until everything\nYou know goes down the way they want it to and then what happens is

especially in recent months that were coming into a top either right now and now we've seen signs of that in the last few days or a week and the whole truth just like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction here which are already close to that\nUm we may make it you know and the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the stock market it's the most overvalued it's ever been even now more than early two thousand the greatest bubble we've seen in our lifetime which of course crashed or\nYou know it was Seventy eight percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through ... you know most of the time stocks go up and then they correct or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get back there you do not hold through this and you do not listen to your stockbroker at this time\nYou buy back in when things hit the bottom\nYeah you know that's the secret to George a lot of people say well what do I do it might well first of all you can be a high quality bonds and make money which she did all through the Nineteen thirties the great depression when everything else was down\nBut the biggest bonuses if you preserve your money or in high quality bonds making some money or or if you're really daring and you're short the market a little bit\nYou got money to buy things when they're down I mean imagine if you could buy the best companies in the world like Amazon or apple or whatever or Coca Cola for eighty percent off or Ninety\nAnd off 'cause they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct is much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down to the person and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're monitoring well what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days is really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for that is that just panic or ... what's

and they go down but it doesn't mean that companies going to go out of business right\nRight again any time you get major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve in government the recession's bad thing\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company to survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the big point bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies will not end well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God it was\nFive and ten years that we used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the\nAnd win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult to social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria no civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here\nIn the U.S we are polarized this Kavanaugh thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean is this there was no common sense no rationality it was just political partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for\nDefending him in installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really I think that the social unrest and this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff and the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate enough and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd and and they're going to hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war\nOn the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial an urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue the south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge and I think there's gonna be ... I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed from the red states because they can't agree on anything that there is nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground it's either red or blue you know\nAnd his argument planets argument in hatred that are on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always a nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost the sole thing you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kinda like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then if I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price\nAnd and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her I suppose it's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover and zero our\nIn our newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened to every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here we have had a couple of guests on who say very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you lose one fellow was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally comment and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turned boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a river so\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that\nUm and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best\nPolls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crashing history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance of happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFor forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what happened when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest ... was the only stock market that violated a critical point yesterday it went down some more but came back up to even but it's still violated but the U.S\nMarkets looked like the ... going to open up two to three hundred points tomorrow now that's minor compared to fourteen hundred points over just the last\n... stay with us we're going to come right back we'll talk more take phone calls with you next on coast to coast to\nCoast insiders

Youngstown\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard camp to across Alabama Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia around one point two million homes and businesses are in the dark no electricity post Michael ABC News meteorologist in Jersey is on the ground and Mexico Beach Florida which took a direct hit from the storm\n\n\nWon't come back to cruise to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well area within the can you predict dumped five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble and the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm\nJust from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending so yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over a bout about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states is kind of the best house and the bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities\nAnd things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spend much more of their money that\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate and more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes that young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just go into Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be really fun to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about one that's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world that makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and and when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I saw most go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona to get things started with a side Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure\nThey're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think ...\nYeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that our money they're pledging but they also tend to have you know capital they raised up to about ten percent\nSo so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm\nAnd getting ready to go and do a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and we're going to hurt them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I and I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms\nHave have it in a brokerage account because they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen in people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go the keys in

and like you to wrap it up here a very conservative guy like me I Am saying flat out we're facing prove civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to be at each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a\nAnd I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas have been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote you know heard instinct Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times and like\nHey hey let let let me are real quickly you're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now

E. R. dot com\nNow George thinks that it's not going to happen and I don't know I kind of think it will\nBut I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because\nI when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path that I I\nDo think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but but this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured\nMassive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next younger generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to part we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went too far and that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices weight and keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off his loan so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens\nIf it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and and the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place\nJust sin if you know send it to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just said everybody at twenty ... every household with twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have help people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefitted corporation including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or you're you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to Harry in Port Huron hello Harry Good to have you\nKnow hello there George an area that question for you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems with farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do if bank if governments have ticks procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my question is why I asked\nA direct it might have even one of my parents fly a lot of my head and humiliate them all on the line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my gardening among the comics um okay what part of that you just answered my question like about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much as um as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off ... off a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out in a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course when\nWhen things go bad people gonna hit for the positives more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a\nProtected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd well that's a good thing Carrie thank you were at a time here ... website it goes to goes

looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that somebody would your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times you know when my book the borders of normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but\nMy aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential doctors bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by his patience and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nFive stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from my own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many rushes to death [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to women moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nI think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans that they had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close Russia's the staff affected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls that that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of that might just kind of ... the ... you know\nI just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well yeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous themselves doing it it's called ... hello Jeanette transplant ...\nWas more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer I just feel like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nAlthough super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um yeah and I had it\nFor many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um fled transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapse and that fight against that they gave me the parents find\nHuh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant she lives in an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact ...\nAnd I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was the name of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the don't you send for Washington DC and the team from the city where I live down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him the death happened\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did say my license and they'd hear\nAltruism you know he said the way it came about was um they were having a donor drive and one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she swab\n... that's it yeah that that she slept to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bank and then um\nYears later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow the produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live in but yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the psychiatrist\n[noise] however since I had that experience and the taxi I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or child quite often will be some type of post deaf contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and nice to have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you and agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or Pete cognitive beams and other things you talked about such that stations and voices and so on\nDeathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP\nUntil after the extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be fake it was just thinking about\nYou right what does that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there in the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise]\nWrong verb weekday

bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh they're so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the mess\nThat's the question like where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these messages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York 'cause I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of\nGetting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and and how how would we know\nIt's right you know um so yeah that could be pretty remarkable\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it but I remember\nBut it just clear as day when I woke up this is a message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion ... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that fate in fact she dreamt of the night before he just tells you that it is going to be assassinated\nShe backed him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar the where the march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong ... premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole many\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't leave their intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to that because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they ... the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think fear I think people are they don't believe that they don't believe in alpha they were afraid of getting into\nSomething which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere'd be any parts of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they thought what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was founded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he just observing everything that was going on\nAnd then when he when he recovered and I couldn't find where she put it statues and he wanted his teeth back\nRight\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wild yeah it works is work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr mystical their mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event so I think paranormal events can have a spiritual component\nYeah\nBut I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live in nine to five eight you know day to day lives that if something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we

there were twenty the Supreme Court of Washington\nState has made that state the twentieth to strike down the death penalty the court declared it's been imposed in an arbitrary and racially biased men or Washington governor Jay Inslee\nDid you shu or is psychotic how do you tell the difference man\nWell the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone who's hearing voices they're certain qualities that would distinguish the psychic from a psychotic experience for example of someone who is the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nIt could be the sound of machinery or insect\nThere may be more than one voice to have the voices talking to each other both the person the voices might be a accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and climbing the other thing is with psychosis\nYou can't just look at one symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work or within the family\nIf the if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the loose nation for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian\nOr you know feelings of\nReference that people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nAnd you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients well they weren't patients they were actors pretending to be patient\nAhah but they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... there were admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patients knew that they were faking so\nThey were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come to the doctors could do that\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nMuch true [laughter] but but the patients that\nThat's right because all the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nYou know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls here for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri hey Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to\nTalk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake and had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I've let my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they get all the major planning for their European\nFront ... well that's\nWhere I used to go as out of body experience when I was little and there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not legal and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be there\n[laughter] but you did that it is a remote viewing huh\nNo I ... I was out of the body travel and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there's really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were fighting on the along the Suez Canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven\nSixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really bad\nWhy I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many\nWell I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping out the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but\nThe most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed because I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you're in that particular place of knowing what all income cussing love is\nAnd what I was during meditation or we've taken and I could see if you know what glitter looks like in a in a like a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles\nWell this was alive light and the whole screen of my vision was filled with this glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\nTotally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but\nI found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when they're just\nI'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I the last time it happened I was in surgery and as I came back into my body I could hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nYou were saying I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] but ... you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called was the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I've been up\nAll right that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to function or whether there's an illness that's interfering with their life\nSo it you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that a person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia because someone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions\nAnd you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell there again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia\nAnd they can also be ... nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting that person's ability to function [noise] but I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain in the dark\nAnd places that are dark maybe he's trying to help maybe in some way she's thinking on a on a spiritual level she can help these people\nAcross cell of Bamako Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia almost one and a half million homes and businesses are in the dark no electricity storm
