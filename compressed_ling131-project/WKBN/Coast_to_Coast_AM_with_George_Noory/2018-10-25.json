our authorities and the intelligence\nCommunities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas and then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on the way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to an end hopefully that's a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast [laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side of the other\nAnd that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem\nI Do believe that the media bears\nAs you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing and looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that some of these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nAnd our law enforcement or individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this\nAnd it won't ever did this with somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nSomebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight shut up wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the weight\nEmpires our staff and America is an empire and people are going to get stuff done but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a paper it'd be one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most fix more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf ... did in ... and ... and when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric that drives us apart\nAnd and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone\nKnow stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week\nAnd and see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as

misinformation and election hacking says the author of a ... book on the company David Kirkpatrick says advertisers\nCould start to showing the platform if scandals don't stop after a year of seemingly endless controversy over misinformation privacy and fake news\nListen to this new development in fiber optics\nCould make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster by detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used to easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost efficiency let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing ...\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a technical comment on the fence today um I Would I Would estimate the probability of the thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time of being very very high\nA pair of Korea I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat means all kind of trace evidence is available for them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI you at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office cameras at\nThe post office or ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence that's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd we've got about a minute left why we're optic story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the eye of the is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole

I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's ... you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an

I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a rush a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near ... big bear\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo I stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about UFOs talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or they could we sending a signal\nThe latest word against it looks like they're about one point six planets per star opera galaxy start\nIn our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion star all that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place and you know that\nChanged as our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and we're at the top of the heap well we're all over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd lead honey a room in other words for others and we come to realize that you know get in here from mayor is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of farmers comes from doing things differently [noise] so the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't

Y. U. haul New York very soon his name's officer Brian\nGolf one and so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy you know you for already endorsing the book yes or if it's something that a little different for me because\nI'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nYeah absolutely and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Arthur\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter is Margaret from Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York and he um somehow got connected with officer God's one and\nWent actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer ... cents and\nHe's very credible and it was not only him but seven other officers are over it two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police\nAnd so the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then\nThe second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big foot bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet what's your take\n[noise] well I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like uh of course you know if you're reading not which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book would be knock it talks about the ... the son of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called enough one\nThose ... unnatural sex acts with the beast of the field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah you know made it with\n... and I find anything can be to\nNow think about this\nAnd a lot of these cases there seems to only be one\nFoot friends there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay\nIf if it's not a hoax then perhaps\nThis creature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think in the old Paterson given so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] Mm I don't know it ...

think there's the intent behind this whole thing\nAnd I think that it is evil intent because uh when you are making such changes to some of the scriptures in the way that they've been altered and

great topic a [noise] a juggling stories one again in Nineteen Ninety One July twenty third now see my dad died how ... how will remind wages in jazz and asked about it\nAnd they need to thousands are Jane on the other one in high school I did I as I again home the yes side of the nation\nThat was for people in the car by John Connelly was never in that bar there was never six people in there\nThat's strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right well\nNo I\nI remember governor calmly and his wife Fagan act are as well because presently governor Connelly with head off though with one of the bullets well\nNo you're right the governor's convoy was in front of him because he ... he had one of the bullets\nMagic bullet\nBut where it was a were was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy and his wife was to his left\nThe but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nStreet there and I can't remember if the if the seat was with Connelly and his wife\nOr you want you know ... ... you know I think con Connelly if\nI remember the artistic sketches of the shooting where they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got hit but but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I like the front seat I think he was in the front\nAt so they so governor currently and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another seating there and then a driver\nOr a or any other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange route and the Tom was looking at it and what do you ... to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second to any ... to put your speaker ... tell me what you're saying\nWell I just I just pulled up does approved her film and I'm watching them come over and what are you just described Kennedy and back with his wife right and I'm hoping you can hear me 'cause I'm I'm looking at the film are now I hear you [noise] and uh and then a congressman front there I don't see a third row of seats\nI didn't I don't remember seeing the third row either belt thanks to okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents at the front seat and then a second row with Governor currently and his wife and his wife was to his last president and Jackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nIt straight and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front driving because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this and I studied that as well as William Cooper is one that was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had to have been left and that if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so they'd have to take his eyes off the road to turn and then make perfect shot you know with his left hand\nAnd everybody wants to see that\nYeah so I you know I don't buy that one every\nWith Bill thanks for being behind the secret door

guess\n...\nA day when we met me rather well I think they're\nI don't show you're not lose McCants\nAbout not being let me tell you and you know like a guy and he was already like me you know what did you get rid of\nThese issues here in ... oh my God you\nPartner I think you know the ... board with Parker Brothers you're right ... that's got to be you\nYou bet Karen I have been doing great George how about you I'm great together we just didn't act like\nEverything's good enough for people who need to know who you are curing doormen is the weed you board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we we divorced tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things talking boards ... boards\nMarlin ... a more ... believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind of let's say up that way she's very ...\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves Luigi board folks as you know I'm opposed to it on and want to use it but Karen feels very secure with a I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge it has to do with the use your your intentions and how to do with the reason why are you the number one and also\nWhat people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have comments since about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nA from a place of light for a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the school changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and introduced to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will believe and that they're earning power that they are just the pond to their world and\nWhen my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strengths within and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that\nKind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have there is no hidden spirits interviewed or power inside of these chunk of wood or cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel's\n[noise] have you ever had a bed and we'd you board experience\n[noise] no I haven't had bad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing that and he wants to the board and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty through through the board they were crossing the border\nBut let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage if somebody in life if I'm if I'm like standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk\nAway or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored you might aboard an eye on a jar and go good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own\nBeliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful of everything\nThat's what I'm a draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving the plan a trip to Iran is at the individual or is there some spirit behind it who's moving\nWell let me answer that from a few different directions one as many people believe it's the idiot motor effect which really basically means your mind is controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles are the power suggestion is making the plant shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nTo Beijing worked with what happened in ...\nThe amazing and I will say this\nOr the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked him before I talked about um before on your show and work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning of frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower the heirs to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plant you have to move and for the for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though Karen to put somebody down if they don't like the ... board that I appreciate it\nWell I I you know that's that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he's one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness and this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness ocean I'm not\nFor that I'm for having a discussion
