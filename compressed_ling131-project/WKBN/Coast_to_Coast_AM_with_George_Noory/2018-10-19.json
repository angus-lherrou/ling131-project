I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving the reading\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you're here you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe ... or a yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers of others who are critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told them I ... I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this what's sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal I Believe he started out doing magic trick because many of these wonderful psychic do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and it it kind of well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames that did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks that haven't started in years\n[laughter] choice to say that when you were growing up you didn't magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nDid a little magic when I was a kid um you know wasn't ... I was a really good at that but uh you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven uh which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce [laughter]\nYes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed you know if I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought it was terrific and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking so restrictive and limiting no into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests are very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be\nIn growing in a consciousness or the kind of a digging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers listeners your birth month and days and all you\nHave a birthday and a first name possible short\nThey're asking about I'm a fellow man to a lot about love and [laughter]\nAnd try to keep each call too by the minute nap or so she came out with his because so many will\nWill cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\n[noise] I don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have if we weren't for more than one time in either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because\nThey've been in other dimensions other planets I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation I have to say yes a variation of it and other churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and the religious voters\nAs a psychic is there anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhen you see a very strange about like um\nAre you picking on them or you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going to cemeteries I don't like the energy there and people who are ... are they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their grave site and they they really want to go into the light they want to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process\nIs really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief\nBut you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right he was and\nThink about that we can wish them well if they're going to feel like God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had to go there and let them go are going to the cemetery very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery ... hours as when I was growing up is that a good word goer [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of a generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and uh I found myself a cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point in my parents were pointing to a muscle am as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of\nThose and I think they were wealthy at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here I'll play you know they're not going to stay here back\nTo this day I was I started crying and they said what's wrong with you I I don't want to live here and they said no no no for my mother explain more about that to me and that was very

you remember the Casey story where he was getting on an elevator yes he could see or has and he looked at all these people in the elevator he couldn't see any ... scared and they haven't caught about how he didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable staff and the people died\nYeah you gotta love Casey ... absolutely George George reminder\nAs a psychic where do you get your I'll call the power where you get it from\nI I don't think it's powered a guy that we're we're really trying to think a lot of people say that and I think on the God as the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely afraid to call in I'm very happy to a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's our life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy is after all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys and many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question oh it's all connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me that night and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] and I don't want you to worry about me\nWhen I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother\nSo animals and that's to your question try to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go [noise] but they do\nHave a really as we all do from pain and misery it's like a it's a wonderful dimension but\nI I I don't want people to think that two sides that right you're supposed to go and you're supposed to go\nAnd you know so\nA suicides are all different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\nSince ... very sad\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to ...\nA feeling of the class that had you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel presses or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSo if you're with the person who is not that good it would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche a\nVampire shy or ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I tried to work with those people by the way I Try to have them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know how\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary [noise] so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates or the ... day in year and then if they want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be grave however you're on a charge that\nThe one that started

[laughter] up there and you argue much I just had one\nOkay so tense exchange so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris oh I'm\nVery much a creature routine and I just wanted that routine and our break his routine can get boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and uh do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\n[noise] um um I used to I Do some writing now\nYes well you have a month and very go at the time you were born and that tells me that your your extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paid you should be paid again that's very therapeutic the press and that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well\nSo you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough now I see so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it did you have a\nQuestion no that was there but thank you very much\n... much less yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know what sometimes can become really really discouraged and you say that to be something else so at that point you have to it\nVery very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to do like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy and so on and change your life and try prayer and meditation they know what I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and something no an spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all of my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up

could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition\nIs that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings Michael dissociation ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army is that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one of the things that kept me going is amongst mine is a book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nCome and sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through

invisible companion George was the older Robert's younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleader and counseling to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as at some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now they want to many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know that for now dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solar consciousness survive physical deaf so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from the life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members are ancestors a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get the on the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past for this life and her mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is another time periods in the multi dimensional universe\nSo this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experience as pop the dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely remain experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we didn't know dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or the goddess if you like but\nYou can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that\nI'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on an more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dreams sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nIn which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done in minutes you get some help with feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it the ... the rush style to sleep on the alarm clock for the need to get the job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in the in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means there's good times and Bachmann loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that that just ... because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says ...\nLosing that cut us sometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nPoint of view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I I'm not doing enough on myself connect with an Anglo Irish men who came to the American colonies\nSeventeen hundred ...

I was in a graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to a head start he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to sudden goal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport\nI don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the these examples proliferate so ... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking for waiting fuel round the next corner which\nIs a very good reason every setting in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack check what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to not to into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality is a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating minded matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's the phenomena that used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time\nMy blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to get get some blood for a blood analysis hits like gosh are my blood is boating and it's on the line you lived in pants\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams\nBefore she put her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Fort took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly reported people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know things\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about the sudden medic response was me pick up things from a distance from other people\nAnd we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nActed dreaming is way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams are going to share them the right way you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some healing energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose and dreaming you could call it ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out looser didn't stay lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay there's some romance an adventure still in the stream let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the dream and have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on by going back inside the dream and facing the ...\nEverybody started certain ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream you know another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift try like state\nTreating sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make of the state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the things that will come to you the porch or pollution dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming that the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook for science books in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't
