this to people who are non believers in all this who might say oh you just tap ... what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that\nBut I often start with I happen to believe at this point that the past and the president and the future all exists in the infinite realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stops someone because one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there to your to your

just fascinates everybody doesn't it\nDoes and they are becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcasts then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt in New York cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust and ice left over from our solar systems creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and dust goes much further\nStarting where the ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and us fear Rickles shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine was indirectly found in twenty sixteen because\nTo date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object but Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests around simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to a dwarf planet in the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing the ghost whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii to find planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this elusive planet nine or planted act that he uh is still trying to mine and he told me\nThat he is planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than ... June ... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the ... that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the ... up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November ... will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes which really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky once once we find planet and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that um\nOn this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun than it would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories um where might come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or that it was inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in ... we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAny that a quarter of a light year oh no it's\nNot even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWeekday mornings they date news radio as I said to be dealt with the TV and\nYears was coming up on them next

welcome back to coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so there's really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the eye PCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to do\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only be\nI'm more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices than they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are are having to be a band that votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they're likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as there's hippies\nBecome habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you get you in the such migrants at one point five degrees but\nYou had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees and that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect\nNorth America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises fair\nSuggesting that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken\nRoot now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change in increasing more gas and we bring more wars\nYes yeah there you go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that are the forty eight continental US state\nFor it and now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes Whoopi risking persistent

the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already one of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs it they get flooding constantly on full moon constantly flooding on high tides that get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and Mary saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami not ten\nThey've got to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nHad melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and now that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida had water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that didn't mean that most of the southern

Wednesday evening's beginning at seven thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight\nIn front of his computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world for my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing updates on three categories the first had to do with the very distressing subject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car road kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspots solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just a phony deflection\nThat he actually involved the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem and air force base a that's down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update\nHad evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body specifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately and I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is\nWhat I was talking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\n[noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these little videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analysts was\nThat he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ... I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt\nThat there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of this parents to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this is provoked by two\nEpisodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream\nAnd that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard or talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn string the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bad coverage of all my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I could see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty great ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looks like it's coming right from my head\nAnd I was just raising the fascination that I didn't know what you're saying then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with fish living\nThat was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I didn't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word boy\nIn your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hired glitz almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I could see peripherally these hire a glass but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they were just float by me but kind of mean at the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a download information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because of my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had

you and our coast audience an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication that the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I had\nBeen receiving these various categories having to do with out of body\nOr what the fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago\nListening to you on the coast to coast while writing this my\nFather was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life he passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office was his caregiver\nLived in this home for almost six years which I currently still owns that you do not live there\nWhile sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nIn the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up\nIt went through the door I did\nMention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends I Am an open minded conscious oriented person\nBut immediate feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color\nI wouldn't normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person I have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house\nMay have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the words smoky fog\nYou offered them up all night\nAnd this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a ... cat that I lost a year ago and that the two of the young ones the big furry

coming from people who say in their opening sentences I have never told a single\nHuman being in my life and I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have
