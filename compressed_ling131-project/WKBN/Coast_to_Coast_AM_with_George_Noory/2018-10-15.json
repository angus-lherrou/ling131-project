understand it's going to happen or more frequently uh over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage\n... imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be there would not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe if the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by\nThe state Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening Leslie stall and

I'm going to take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review are or who was it was very well known or ... or drop here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls this waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by Clinton as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner bought\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have around fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten a originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John Paul devolved and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in costs me gloom ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have\nIs there a consistency to the ah repeating of the thicker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps is that every twelve is there some kind of ...\nNo I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know to me it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I\nI'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nBecause you know you were just you know simple minded I thought that they weren't just applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egypt and the Egyptians designed their parents with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount Ford\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to fat thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen veteran decker\nThat the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in a state to block interview I think I said that uh Belmont dish 'em shot a shop to ... and ... published at Cape was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a cave in a big dip her\nIt was a star Iraq\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation it was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper\nAnd why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI got to jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we got to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back

am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that PDF\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you strike three hundred ... a a scrawled on the page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing bowl and you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks a war specifically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right then you have to have some basis for this and clearly\nWe have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example correspond a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface area that is around fraction of twenty fifth from Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of the great pyramid show right that\nCost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than than than the one that we just talked about is a question I'm thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact that the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted tower but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be role eighty four\nNo row eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they

Dan rivers\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot tomorrow and\nThe paramount thanks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key supply town and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a\nRemote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples have spent discussed\n... yes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to\nHarshly restore the monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard or it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this was on the direction of Peter\nI'm a new alien um they are basically re creating these ah ah ah I ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to ah descend into a virtual world and we exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think is looked at you be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform\nTo this uh you know the simple rules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids and for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned\nWhat is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public can take my answer on the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there are now with you\nRegarding jumped to have a lot so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nI'm regarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so I'm the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they won research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you see that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is ... ... watts was still the director of their\nKey I think he is actually involved or Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved a ... at these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved they asking for is at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed\nBack here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said\nPolitical right now and I I understand that I knew it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that are they gonna have to open right are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so the listener's question I think I forgot was down here I think right yes um yeah so I think what you said the love and so I think that has something has changed a sort of a\nYou know people are even talk to some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fair that they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the

Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nPrint for the great pyramid is included in the top of him you know a numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid you can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the question is yes I think that's the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I\nAssume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north and maybe a something astrological uh within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched a documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nOr has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the traits I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\n[noise] [noise] yeah well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off of our as opposed to sum it up the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a and\nIt would have been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter off that fear is a meter\nOr it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a stitch Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins\nThat there was this fear on top of the great fear of it's not if you're a media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by age and height I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new ones can show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that uh Rudolph guns and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that ah who Don and fire investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right the north\nEast corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up to a place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the
