Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI Want to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books are insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seem to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities or some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's\nA lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution in my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the drags fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are\nDown and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with\nThe the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh I kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families\nAnd covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA runner and out of resources we've got stopped well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching wind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers\nThat they had found disappearances in their parks were they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information that couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service

written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that for a moment before we jump into the cases\nThis is one of the most frustrating parts of you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David flight is missing for one one missing and national parks there all frauds\nThey're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent\nAnd listeners to get on and\nEvery time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads the only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know\nIf somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use euro in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name as specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most time a lot of times they want there's a case from eighty six\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track but that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one\nHad a list that accumulated that probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida was found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old ... Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last scene with these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about and I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty\nMiles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are the\nMaking this extraordinary distance and extraordinary hike [noise] when I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hand and I said if I said OK you set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away or watch the child the child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and your think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise]\nBut I have all these examples where these heights been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know an incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nOh yeah it's got to be talked about a two year old boy that they just traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was from face down in snow the next morning unbelievably why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has\nNo recollection of what happened this is Martha couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe even know why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours you have to go watch six miles per hour\nOr by the kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up for some something or someone picked him up and locked up there\n[noise] [noise] well ... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas and they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away\nYou know ... to put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time doesn't\nMake\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

police are there\nWell there's an art a location called Oregon or gee a an organ pipe cactus national monument and it's an Arizona far southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico\nWell on February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two years old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico\nDrove there and was going to take a few days vacation and break from school and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called er\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff yeah some pretty documents on that case I got the documents in my hand that I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any\nI said have you heard of that case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all the articles in all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money she loved the outdoors hike regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residents in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions was smart February second she went to the park visitors center spoke\nTo a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nFebruary third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth\nAt nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in F. this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger smart smart thing to do\nNo I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on for ... seconds he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that sending to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined Carol was laughing eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service store to get low on resources they\nAlso called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted carols parents in North Carolina\nThe parents that are that Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second that Ryan told the Associated Press it's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery\nMarch seven one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh off the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd again they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane a

E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to Treasure Island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scramble to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the boy\nWill the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them at ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had uh LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in the file and they couldn't explain why it was their\nMinute eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field against dating that in LA had crashed\nIn the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast or the navy response to Daly city and they find the airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to ... near perfect condition both\nMotors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were white preserves over the water both of the life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone\nThere was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks the radios in perfect condition no distress call\nFor function and called back and say they said they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nThe central coast of California had a major search that started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip and dropped to ... on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowds\nThey said all appeared fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared the crash happened at four thirty to build your street Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean the crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere's a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break in the background to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded up break with the journey wheel in the sky\nMind them ... and I just logged on to ... am done\n\n\n\n\nOur lady oh weekends for a time capsule sports fans are Sandy lasted I'm here to get you on a journey back this week in sports history let's start back in Ninety\nMessage and I think they will return to listen to Nick and Vicki story about the quiet [noise] ... and ... carry\nNothing day raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier so Oscar Sater we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and\nTwenty one and the first broadcast of the world series on radio in New York Yankees beat the New York giants three zero as we can Nineteen sixty times also Marco\nEasier than ever we age list male Macs a patent pending formula within a greedy and that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater in\n...

uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood there was massive\nSearch off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bog there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the crowds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there\nWere lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because Jeff north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which had several strange disappearances I've documented and just south\nOf the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area and nothing immediately half a half moon bay so it's one area that has just strangeness attached to it\nAnd like you said they they came up with some explanation for to me that were laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or I mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get in that case I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of in Walker ranch you know\nIs going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from this guy several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman bucks it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin walk Iran's that a program that have been created by\nThe Pentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin walk around and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ...\nUm that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch and\nI asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean\nAnyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know\nHe he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody who's been looking at it is a I think it's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call I think so um\nSo ... you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance that I could sing my teeth into that can related to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say just related to missing people that I study but as I said before sometimes I think\nI related to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's just filled with water\nI have no cases from there it's bizarre and isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the most right in the middle of the ... reservation in the ... ah control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people have brown there and uh\nSo you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really uh dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that\nThe person who told me that in D.C had brought them your books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are gonna want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nThe FBI like with any other kind of priority investigation will deem this at the top

living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm gonna send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah\nAnd we shut down at a picnic table and the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking with what's your name\nThey they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a glove creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped\nAt least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out and then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that that creature and those people that are pure\nWere part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was\nA genetic hybrid this is what I Believe

it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story in my last book one right before the ... about a story of a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came upon this giant piece a pink granite in Texas it's a state park\nAnd he said that after he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him and he said that he was inside this Boulder he guessed that made it for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that isn't the only story I've got like that and ah people probably don't know this but there are stories out of Iceland that\nThey will move over the road when they're building it before they will blow\nUp a piece of granite or big Boulder because
