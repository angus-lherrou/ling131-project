I'm a member of the government the you can help us get breast cancer research foundation and making an ... San\n... mental things mean everything people in this state family I Would apply\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guess George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but\nCertainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you really these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative\nEmotional energy drawing ...\nI practice something called modern actresses and and that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel them\nAnd it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so to negative\nSpirits and so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place for carpet paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that and they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of\nEnergy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nBoth kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea that first negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent trees say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because where I work with\nPeople from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody any ways really\nIt's not necessary there's no such thing as as a distance on a non physical\nLevel doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family\nThat's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies their energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nOr that are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I get people call up and say well like I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all\nNo you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which calling me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know it they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website starkly

afternoons at three [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey human once we get to calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you been in with us\nOr both or just a few years ago um I did a three nights a stand essentially at a legitimate haunted mansions and very famous I won't mention the name but um it's\nSomething I was against for years and years and years for use all invitations I finally they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and ah so ah it was essentially set up\nFor ... to go in and uh with real quick and then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something that people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bat I forgot what that's called and the patch learn but\nVery heavy gold she it was called the gold room and it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there\nUm I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite me because all of people home negative spirit's just they will get\nYou know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want so I don't react to the ... you know the\nSay the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's strange possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me in the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear it loud and clear just horrific song slowly and I'd just I'd you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at the at this time I was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion\nAnd actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to lose\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits in somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the\nCalls come pretty quickly you know in times immediately you know it's like you know we feel\nBetter right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and they need a clearing\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I guess that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling drained\nBecause they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy and we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run negative spirit and so\nYou know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really helps\nYou know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or over the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinute already five different things so remarkable it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing has different George depending on what is going on with the client and may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround six people that is coming in for their six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has an effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits and so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep meaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy\nAnd also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into\nApartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its old very beautiful but I mean think of\nThe moon energy just\nMutilated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session and all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good low cost ...\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to Jay in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey

negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues unhappiness a overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen\nAnd and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of the media does but actually\nWorking on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office\nMy girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power\nSuddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the demonic spirit had pulled muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself\nSo all of the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know the\nTrip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing exercises ... and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I was saying\nI Am not a spirit psychologist [noise] uh it's\nKind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steer steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for the spirits out\nThere that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nA mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary but actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kind of things in past life helping people\nThat to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work but the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they loved it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the real reward is Val I'm feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure is Jeffrey you bought your website would you please\n... you can find\nEverything you want to know about me it's dark clear dot com stark clear dot com it's gotten my Skype address my email

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and once in a looser tree but afterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream\nBut what I'm curious about is somebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has been consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is\nThat it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nShe hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you'll okay where you\nAre I'm engaged hanging um I had a um a thing you could lose believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little bit of the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was in a bone in my life where\nI didn't really know if God was real or if they do all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything and then I'm going back to the point when I was out and do you want to live in a a a gun and I was like ... ...\nYou know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to\nBelieve my so uh it's probably ... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later than what happened when\nI started seeing these little things like with people like um beagles like these little spinach and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight and it seemed like everybody he had freeing the everything he did he touch was no I mean you have a one like you know what I'm saying in and then I think one can't he didn't have none okay\nNow these kids that you know oh it's a glass of water without knocking over some breaking it it's something told me that he was willing to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he just didn't have the time and I'm leaving it was kind of me just to show me that you know how it works or no and then so [laughter]\nSo I bought a church in a ...

C. S.\nOr the penguins have a ... problem with all the injuries that they suffered earlier this year and it's come back to bite them uh and they they damn near half to play a perfect game in order to beat teams like South Dakota state and there was anything but today\nYeah and I I think it's so frustrating because in the first act you felt like you have plenty of opportunities you know you you go down and you get a kick block on your opening drive it could have been three points and and you go down and you're knocking on the\nDoor and it stopped short and then you get a Fifteen yard penalty you know because you're trying to call time out and then you have a longer feel goals that you miss and on top of that you have to\nPick fixes that you dropped and I firmly believe if DJ small the price gifts and catch those four paws or those near interception they'd probably go score so it's\nBeen more of the same I just um you know more\nUm self inflicted wounds you know just ... yeah that's all it's been missed opportunities you know I think physically the theme was just as good as South Dakota state you saw that early they played with them they all turned Christian who's one of the most explosive quarterbacks in the nation to just Seventy eight yards passing but\nYou know they gave up some big plays in the game and I just mental errors again you know if if you just clean clean up the mental heirs and play a clean game you're probably right in this thing uh but when you let a great team as you mentioned you give them free opportunities and extra possessions\nYou don't have a chance and you know it's just it's confounding you know I think you're you're at a point where you would think six games in that the mental errors would get cleaned up and it's just not gotten better game by game in some cases it's gotten worse so um\nYou know I think at this point you have I don't know if the coaches you know they don't have the same mindset but I think you've got to start figuring out who can help you moving forward\nZach lot of guys know exactly I I ...\nI completely agree with you look I mean we're we're halfway through the season now look if you're still doing mental errors then you need to put yourself on the bench and you let someone else come in who is not going to do the mental errors 'cause this is ridiculous at this point\nYeah not agree with you on athletic director ... ... you can see the preparation you're on the first chapter in the right places\nYou know I I think they're prepared I think the game plans are solid cooks cleaners ... over a number of years you know how to get a team ready to play it's just it's the execution it's going out on the field doing it taking what you do during the week and and doing it on Saturdays and\nThey're just not doing that right now and you know it's unfortunate for guys like Kevin the castor and save on Smith and Arman delegate and you know these seniors who live you've been through you know some great seasons and went to a national championship game two years ago to to be in a position now where\nIt's it's it's not looking good and it's going to be difficult to find when the rest of the way so you have to keep plugging away obviously your next week you get a chance at homes that ... back and it's not going to get any easier with South Dakota but at this point the whole goal you just gotta clean game I mean you you just got to go out and have a game where you don't turn it over don't get a kick block just play it clean game and\nI'm just try and prove yourself that you can you can put together a game without the mental errors\nYeah if you can put together a clean game there's a really good chance penguins wind up winning a game and\nAnd again South Dakota a they got ... northern Iowa tonight and they're building a that's a seven o'clock starch or South Dakota's not at a a a bad season this year\nA you know there are certainly going to be a test or at three and two there are the one of two teams that are undefeated in the Missouri Valley football conference North Dakota state and South Dakota\nNorthern Iowa one in one two and three overall there in the same boat with the penguins they need this game denied in the worst way otherwise they're going to find themselves having to win out in order to just make the playoffs so obviously if a South Dakota the whole serve at home or they're going to be coming in\nSky high tied for first in the Missouri Valley football conference it will be a difficult game but but like you said ... I mean if they play a mistake free game and they don't you know they they don't do the little things that ultimately killing this team\nOr the penguins can actually be a good team when they're not doing the little things wrong\nOh I I think they've shown that you know I think there's been spots where you see when they don't make those mistakes if they're writing games and\nUm you know I think that if there is something policy to take away from the day I think defensively secondary has played better and you gave up some big place in Iran game today which which arch in the second half but you know the whole town Christian to Seventy eight yards passing and and have some consistency you know not give up too many big place through the air I think is a step forward because you're going to face another talented passing off in the next week\nThat's okay and I'll I'll answer by saying that that Fifteen yard penalty only allowed to a a missed field goal of thirty five yards thirty five or thirty six yards Kennedy's Kennedys had an awful year and he's one of the kids that better shape up real quick\nBecause he's going to find themselves no longer kicking on this team or at least no longer the starting ... kicker may look to Fifteen yard penalty okay I can I can understand and thanks for the call Jim I appreciate it because we got to move along well guy going to understand if someone wants to moan and groan about the Fifteen yard generally\nA wearable Fellini went bananas on the sidelines and got an sportsman like conduct but it shouldn't have cost the penguins any points of good field goal kicker still kicks the field goal and still gives the penguins attend denying lead\nYou know we don't have a good field goal kicker right now I hate to say that but it's the truth we just do not have a good field goal kicker right now uh before yeah let's go to Ron right now Ron you're on the fifth floor to show what's going on Ron\n... thanks run a horse off it's good to hear from I'm Glad that you're feeling better yeah everything's man\nAnd look at this guy had tickets a back and they\nSeem to remember that why you hardly even had a football team first off and you could compare that you're in traffic or you're\nGoing one democratic all of them there there's a link was ... strong as it is now the league has grown three four five fold from time to her was\nThey weren't even in the Missouri Valley football conference when Russia was here that's that's the other thing I regret\n... Quakers are really good are getting better all the time\nBecause they're good and great prayer for come in here I think we're getting a little bit from your not finding the right players were suffering from a lot of uh injury right now as well as you mentioned was not a bad flu or American before it's a cool if you had five from 'cause\nWe're in there in in in the right time to go right and unfortunately it's costing them\nIn the long run so then we go to jail and they've come together and all\nThat often ... your first and if we can actually start flying are winning they\nWere not getting that right now we're getting mistakes\nAfter mistakes here and there than here they're caught the gloom and they really shouldn't be and I worked in it if not both calling for her record pretty darn good coach that we have right now for why we're weaker respect that that um you know like you're correct quarter player on the field and expect\nThem you know not really for the ... you can only bring a ...\nOr what's going on and part of murder murder rate for him to go back out there to do the right thing or create their own again then you have to pull him off the field or whatever\nIt is you know for all interesting Ron it's just frustrating it's frustrating when these kids are doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing in practice and then you get them out to the game and it's like they've never done this before it's it is incredibly frustrating to see the proud of\nThat is supposed to be really good uh we're not even anywhere remotely close to that because unfortunate leader nowhere near uh the product that they're supposed to be fit and it's it's fortunate\nI Can't agree more with you I mean I Love his team you know I was a wise you grab that as well can stick around as well but\nYou know I've been following this team for a long time too but one more quick climate before I let you go you might be a top of it I'm not sure but yeah I don't know what's going on with the buckeyes either but I'm telling you that these trends just starting to get a suspicion just suspect\nThese teams are figuring out what they could do against his team and in this\nIf we were playing better caliber teams we'd be losing these to these games thank goodness Minnesota and you know the the teams that were planning or just not that good like Indiana as we can get away with you know giving up these big place here and there and the office again is not doing well either um\nWe don't have a multi faceted off and it's like we used to Haskins\nCannot run yeah well that's a huge issue and he is ...\nYeah that's that's a that's something for other people down in Columbus where we're not talking about guys but ah but I feel your pain I definitely feel your

state final score thirty six to seven ... seven to six lead in the first quarter South Dakota state rip off a rips off I should say the final thirty points of today's game and they get a victory and as I mentioned at the top of the fifth quarter show\nIf you would have told me at the beginning of the day that ... would be held to Seventy eight yards passing on seven ... seven completion in sixteen attempts\nI Would have sat back and said okay penguins have a serious chance at winning this ball game unfortunately a couple of turnovers a lot of miss tackles a frankly some God awful play on the all sense of line and unfortunately once again guys that\nKnow what they're supposed to be doing in practice that once again did not so show where they were supposed to be in a\nIn the in the game and it's little things like that that is turning this program into a two and four team wanting to in the Missouri Valley football conference and if the penguins are going to turn this around\nThat they are going to have to find some guys that are going to know where they're supposed to be the right reads that they are supposed to have\nA they're supposed to be the right place at the right time I think that they have done very well in practice that just have not transpired I end the games\nI think it's about time where the ... coaching staff had better sit back and say\nOkay if you can't do this and we're halfway through the season now if you can't do this then you're going to have to be taken out of the ballgame and someone else is going to have to go in and do this penguin sat at least to pick six is that were dropped\nA lot of opportunities where the penguins if they were in the right place would have been able to bottle up South Dakota said our number on numerous occasions to today unfortunately they weren't in the right place and it all adds up to a thirty six to seven set back which\nIf you look at the statistics and again the statistics do not tell the story all the time but the reality is the penguins out game South Dakota state three forty four to three thirty one they had to turnovers it cost them seven points\nUh South Dakota state did not turned the football over and they did a great job absolutely abusing the Youngstown State all sense of line they were able to uh\nI get in on a couple of ... they were able to hurry Montgomery van border and again van border in his three league games is now throne six interceptions\nUh the cleanup of the of the mistakes with the turnovers and other things it's\nWell it it really depends on what
