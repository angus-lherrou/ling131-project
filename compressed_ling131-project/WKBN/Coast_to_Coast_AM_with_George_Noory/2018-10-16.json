airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have an air price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now\nBecause you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy\nAnd it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that subject like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was that like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state

the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust well it's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy ... look at\nAnother indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate\nNow how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes them on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequences the president states has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you don't watch him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out the Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew is remains I Can't remember where they put him to but they will have a country\nIs the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the

know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even a ... two oh five two fifty a gallon\nBut now we're pushing four dollars a gallon and uh I I really think though that would have an effect probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into this fear that some somebody would wake up to ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something is happening\nAnd I don't know the the the the world down anything is possible anything that we speculated about the past is coming true it it's just weird how you know and and it can you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves in it in a in a moment of scarcity\nWhen I talked about weeks ago with what the and re Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services and and and make everything uh a happy global family see this is

the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a in that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United states of America\nGo to George in Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have a foot here scenario world that I think you're right about the eight states but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that that rallies way Trump has to ignite the public on both directions good and\nBad or we have and if for sure we have George George no these are like the way say white light but no you know I\nHad known as the fact that there are other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be the major but I think the next one coming up is it will all of a sudden we're destabilized with this tape state narrowly involved in all this Trump is going to be able to put himself\nIn a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carrying the through until we stabilize the country\nDo you have the war so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about it well he did he would lay that loss you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about what the uproar is between the neo Nazis planned everything that's going on think about all the uproar what's going on and what this is setting up for and I mean ... if you look at it in a respect the\nLaw is not going on that it's not happening\nBut then he's okay well that can't happen but it is happening look at all the diversity or I mean like that's happening with the Arab by up or you got all these a fraction of the people that are just ... fit about everything and then the country if you look at things\nWill be stabilized everywhere\nAnd I think Trump has an exercise any of those things yet because I don't know if he knows the odds of it as it is disposal or if he does happen to supposedly chooses not to use them you realize he could jail reporters were lying about it if he wanted but he had it alone\nBut see that that the pitch but if he does that again why would not be the time to do that\nRight now will not be the time to make any rash decision about Saudi Arabia but he's going to have to 'cause he's being pressure to do it and then they know that\nWe made the problems with the gas pump we may see some problems with inflation and the economy we may or may see some stuff go down and this is why I say this is the deep state move it to the deep state movement a worldwide on the world wide scale\n... you're you're thinking it's all you know against him no I don't get any it again Larry it's against the United states it's against it and it set up a lot of different things and he's part of that set up\nI don't buy it I don't buy the trumps the part of it not

oh in award winning historian longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've cross with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nAh their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group on one side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith ... and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group that the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with this sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nCom is at us and believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether at us and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written and I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect up and see you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete hands on math is\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can define miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a thought in the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in advance\nMentally and and often the shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives of other\n... before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved it and the guy missed it or something like\nAnd now here's a story about or he's an old\nA a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law items when I was Fifteen Years old and I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arriving go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost that you couldn't find it and he was telling a story about it in and out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping and it was the tight class\nThat that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter] yellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing these are the ... in there for that [laughter] it's amazing but\nBack to these miracles and when we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but\nBack to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side the curse of other people they put ... on other people\nAnd then a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum and my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether\nYou are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people something's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection\nAgainst evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimension to the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research to quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMitch we're going to come back and talk more

Dan rivers [noise]\nExplain what an affirmation is\nAn affirmation very simply is just announcing something that you want to select announcing a reality that you want to select\nAnd a great time to use an affirmation of just need to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud agreed to them to use an affirmation is those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state\nIt is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but\nBut cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time and ask them\nFor tell a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur when people hold African nations in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night\nThat is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals\nAnd I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've actually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real\nIf you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life and you know these are things you\nWant with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that the method we can all do it is easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy that the the the the important thing is to do it with consistency\nIs to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty arriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things to coalesce around one name has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism\nThey become an enormously powerful what is it a laser other that focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions\nThat I never could have expected I've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nWhere you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true and the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes a gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the miracle\nGlide the miracle club I used to say that anybody can join the miracle ... he didn't have to\nSign your name up any where there is no magic decoder ring in anything and of course that's true everybody who's listening is automatically a member of the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun if people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club but anybody who emailed me and I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet\nIt's just something fun to have with you\nTo sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising how many people have miracle stories\nOverwhelm you know\nYou know we have to understand that life is made up of of of joys and and sometimes great tragedies but in as much as we do experience catastrophes in life and let's face it that's a part of life\nWe also experienced extraordinary absurdly unexpected moments of good news there are in fact times George where we get just what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role\nIn that again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable

me about the power behind writing down a goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal and really demand that we put something out of a book that Dick and that's kind of magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity and the one the hidden key behind every health health program with something won't work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolute definite chief aim in life and that can be something that we very often resist\nWriting things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener\nIs whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus and mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDo all of my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes and the mental human tradition of things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who were drivers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experimenting with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend\nIn New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one

I Know you love very deeply the magic of the leaving\nOn and so\nYeah and my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he\nListened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss who said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that you know you can carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand\nDollars in ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend you truly felt like a miracle\nThat is America it really is yeah it's exactly what he experienced and was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up at these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things given twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in

cognizant state just before we fall asleep at night\nAnd act in image in your mind enact a scene of something that you want to happen but don't enact it is if you're looking at it on a movie screen and acted as if you're in it if you want to climb the ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder but climb climb you know really feel those rungs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene in order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders and you always need to bring it back\nIf you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking your hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you you've got a promotion at work\nIn time in time that will Congress ties into reality may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of gestation or an interval but in time it will occur stick with it you were a Simpsons harden into fact eventually\nLet's go east of the Rockies to begin

things on you know what we wish for other people rebounds to us because in effect\nYou know if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great over mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called it the oversold pneumonia and he'll called an infinite mind in a sense once we've determined that the mind is extra physical we determine that we're all\nConnected that separation is just illusory so
