be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics when he's in Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to how we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they've built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced and wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the end you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... end up this rage not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this says this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible offer Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplice\nHere that this is the time\nYou know\nWith our election updates through\nAnd nationally after this election\nWere going to be listening by Seventy [noise]\n\nResident Trump campaign rally in Lexington, Kentucky where a Democrat who is retired Marine fighter pilot challenges of the incumbent Republican congressman\nYou can either vote\nRule or you can vote for Republican Party stands proudly\nThe law and order freedom and justice [noise]\nEarlier President Trump gave the status of the investigation into the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Yamanaka showed the last scene entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey over a week ago but not coming out\nYou know we're looking into it very seriously a turkey is looking into it a very high level at the highest level and so is Saudi Arabia\nA caravan of more than a thousand people in Honduras is headed to Guatemala aiming to reach the U.S officials raised total deaths from hurricane Michael do over twenty Florida's governor says Seventeen hundred crew members have searched over twenty thousand damaged or destroyed homes Chuck secrets an ABC News\n[noise]\nThis audio is for your review for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of other ... copy of the air quality origin on his property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal health introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more online go family care dot com that's family care dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nUses for terrifying attractions one location designed to get\n\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show\nThem out on the show and the answer is no one else does deserves the truth about Congress\nRule of law is indispensable to a thriving and vibrant society [noise] she'll citizens from government over reaching an arbitrary ...\nPursuing truth means always yelling the fact [noise] even if they run counter to our house [noise]\nIn a courtroom [noise] truth about credible evidence [laughter]\nStrong opinions\nSounded a lot of talk about ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize what a five ... five applications actually a warrant just like a search warrant in order to get five a\nSearch warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know assigned ...

on the New York times the thought that we don't know what it's gonna be this coming week\nYou never know but ah any we could all is a good weekend appreciate that [laughter]\nUm you believe a summing up the the jury in the Simpson case wasn't smart the judge was bad right across the ... a prosecution was atrocious right and as far as the so called dream team is concerned quoting from your book I'll quote in fact\nIt was only the greater incompetence of the prosecution's say right on average bureau belly Scheck at all from defeat a yes so you really leave all that\nYeah not only not only do I believe it not only do I let it about anyone will read the book guys almost compelled to go along with those conclusions because if there's one thing about me are uh uh\nThat I never do I never make a charge without support in it and uh I I have a tremendous amount of support for everything and I say I don't just say something without giving four or five examples to support what I'm saying\nWhen I talk about the in competing for the prosecution in this case the page after page after page there's just no way that anyone can read this book or without coming to the same conclusion and it's because\nOf these revelations the shocking revelations of incompetence in in my book out rate that the word of mouth has been fact that the book a shot up the number one of the country because here too for the American people have been blaming the jury for this verdict and of course the jury was very bad ... don't\nGet me wrong and I are on that at all very very bad they many of them blaming the LAPD claiming the LAPD botched the case before I came to trial and but the main reason why this case was loss was the unbelievable and confidence that the prosecution in this case and you have to realize art I think you know my background I'm very\nPro prosecution no one in this country with more supportive of these prosecutors in Iowa throughout the entire case I mean I even sent them a telegram\nOn the morning there's summation trying to pump them up but I had uh\nYeah I'm an option here either not do the book and I actually I was talked into doing it by my editor and I'm happy now that he did a or write the book and be candid and uh this is a very serious charge that I make and against the prosecution in this case I supported in space so there's just no question about it\nMore than ... on either incompetent up there and watched every moment of the trial a lost a lot of sleep over and I presume you pretty much do as much as you could the same thing yeah did you sit there is sort of beating your fist against the wall about how well\nYou know I also got on radio and TV I kept a to a minimum but I got on radio and TV and said many of the things that I'm saying in the book now so this is about Monday morning quarterback but I get on radio and television and say they've got to offer some of the evidence is very very incriminating evidence of it was a conventional type of evidence that\nLaypeople you don't even have to be very bright laypeople has been consistently basing verdicts have guilty on for the past two centuries it's the type of evidence that\nIs automatically associated even by people rather low intelligence or with guilt DNA is very good evidence don't get me wrong and I'm not criticizing the prosecution for presenting\nA DNA evidence in this case a but DNA is very complex very difficult to understand it it was all an alien to this jury but evidence like Simpson\nOr taking off when he was being charged with these murders and they're finding in his possession of gun a passport a cheap disguise several fresh changes of under clothing and and and ... a driver the eight thousand seven hundred fifty dollars in cash on him which he proceeds to tell the police the Simpson had given him inside the bronco\nThat type of automatically associated by lay people off a with guilt and it was not offer it to this jury ever saw that evidence\n... speed stuff ah Dominic Dunn the respected writer has publicly stated wanted to prosecute him didn't present that evidence he says through his sources\nThat he's aware of sheep conversations of Simpson during the bronco chase where he's talking on a cellular phone sobbing crying claiming to be an innocent man who framed is that why they don't use it\nIn the frame no no ... not no no uh Dominic is partly true there he was denying guilt a big deal\nBig deal up it means nothing when someone is charged with murder and they'd be an ideal of course they're going to do and I know who in the world expects them to confess\nThat is the reason by the way that the prosecution did not offer that evidence nor did they offer a suicide note with absolutely reek with guilt I mean show me an innocent person charged with murder\nWho would write a note like that so they were afraid of it\nWell that yeah but but but for the wrong reasons in the suicide note\nSimpson denies guilt to also the thirty two minute interrogation of Simpson the day after the murders rent a incidentally I have the I was able to get a hold of the audio that thirty minute interrogation and I've transcribe it and it's an independent of the book is the only book on the Simpson case that has interrogation ...\nWhere he admits dripping with blood on the night of these murders has no idea how he got caught but in that interrogation he also denies guilt and the prosecutors you're right they kept that out they kept that out all of that because they didn't ... this is what they said you can't make this up it's too far out to make up dark and says it in his book\nThey didn't want the jury to hear Simpson denying guilt without us taking the witness stand ... but aren't the jury already knew that Simpson has denied guilt I mean they knew he pled not guilty that's why they were having a trial for Pete's sake I mean if the guy had come fast if\nHe had pled guilty there would not have been a trial you're going to keep out extremely powerful evidence like this or just to prevent the jury from hearing something that they already know that it's mind boggling and this is the mentality of these prosecutors good people the good guys lost here\nThis is the mentality of these people were representing the state of the Simpson case and and people wonder why this guys on the golf course with a smile on his face\nYou're going to keep out for instance the passport the cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and the fact that our colleagues has all this money on him which Simpson gave him all this cash because he denying guilt because he's denying ... I mean the jury doesn't know that he did I get why are they having a trial it's mind boggling\nI don't know what about the civil trial and all of this that didn't come out in that trial will come out we would not in the civil trial I can\nGive you a virtual one hundred percent guarantee that um the plaintiffs lawyers like Daniel Patrick ... whom I spoke to they will be offering that evidence anyone would offer that evidence why these prosecutors didn't\nWhy they're so incompetent I don't know because I keep hearing that around the country why are they someone competent why did they do this and I can't tell them I mean it's like asking me\nA wire Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dog a great basketball players I Can't tell you I can tell you that they are but uh the genesis of why they're so great uh I don't know but yeah\nThat evidence will be offered like virtually any other prosecutor in the country would have done if they had handled the case that evidence will be offered during the civil trial and I'm very confident that\nThere'll be a judgment against Simpson uh uh in that civil trial the question is whether he's already spirited as money out of the country and they're gonna be able to like on the judgment that none of the real problem\nDuring and Clark moves on a very in your face kind of a presentation and a lot of people translated that to competence and they apparently didn't look a little bit deeper at some of the things we just talked about oh with regard to the evidence not presented\nWell actually they were not in the face they should have been a lot more in the face they were much or too casual a and laid back they were extremely casual and laid back they may have been a little in the face a outside the presence of the jury when they were talking to judge Ito in front of the jury\nThey couldn't possibly have have been more definite imagine in your eyes what this guy Simpson did to these two victims viciously stabbing them to death you know their life blood draining out of them the horror and the fright in their eyes the last moments when they were trying to survive imagined that now imagine now imagine\nMarsha Clark during jury selection telling this jury\nWhile this thought on your mind that I just told you he is such a sympathetic guy okay then telling the jury this is not a fun place for me to be making this up this stuff in the transcript\nIf she tells the jury this is not a fun place for me to be art\nThat's like telling the jury you know I really don't want to be prosecuting this guy but I had been assigned the case so what can I Do then she tells the jury or you may not like me for bringing this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse than to tell a jury\nThat you're not winning any popularity caught as because if you're telling them that that's like telling them the majority of people outside that courtroom\nSet of four wintertime seem even more than two hundred dollars back by mail every day when you buy a set of force like good use hires your credit card just isn't any one location\nLives are dot com in some some of the credit approvals he sold for details\nFrom sending family separations at the southern border if they feel that will be separation\nThey don't come you know\nIf they fail the separation is a terrible situation there president\nWas on his way into a political rally in Lexington, Kentucky this as a caravan of more than one thousand Hondurans is winding its way toward their country's border with Guatemala with the goal of reaching the U.S\nTurkish officials have an audio recording of the alleged killing of a journalist Yamanaka showed the from the apple watch you or when he walked into the Seventy consulate in Istanbul over a week ago that according to a pro government Turkish newspaper\nRescuers intensifying efforts to find survivors may be trapped amid the ruins of the small for the panhandle community Mexico beach devastated by hurricane Michael where one body has already been recovered tempers are flaring and power could be out for weeks total deaths from the hurricane now over twenty\nChoked secrets an ABC News\n[noise]\n\n\nWe took on\nSomewhere in time I was raised new number one on the New York times best seller list the author Vincent de ... it'll be right back [noise]\nMethod you dated ... burning\nYour degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors\nAll on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little list sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

a you know several months off work to attend to trial\nWell I don't really know what that means because uh if these people weren't the brightest people in the world with which you question them may imply that all the more reason why you offer conventional evidence like flight you know after he was being charged with these murders he took off the fact that he cut himself and has no idea how I got got cut the fact that he writes a suicide note I mean\nYou know when you're charged with murder or if you're innocent you're going to be blazing mad that you're being charged a desperately want to prove you're innocent find out who murdered the mother of two children instead he becomes very passive and he writes the farewell letter that ... like a suicide note\nOr he refers to himself as the last person these things are incompatible with innocent so in answer to your question\nIf all the more reason why they should've offer these conventional uh items of evidence I'm not saying they should have offered DNA but not to the exclusion of these conventional\nLook talking about DNA for a second all these other issues inside right I'm just an average person talk show host um but I understand numbers why didn't the DNA evidence alone convicted\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme or a or incompetence here um the defense every time\nEvery time they made an argument to explain away incriminating evidence the prosecution either did not respond at all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion the\nMain pieces of evidence in this case other than that that\nThat I just told you you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pat I would've convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation along but the main item of evidence against Simpson was his blood was that the murder saying okay there was blood on the ... gate\nA which was also has found later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify not collected the night and that was not collecting\nFind if you move from an out of the kids altogether is there a conviction\nOff [noise] if ferment were not involved at all in this case um they would have had them the defense would have had a more difficult time\nArguing the conspiracy theory and injecting race into the case but they would have found some way to do it uh although it would have been more anemic the prosecution would have had a greater likelihood of a conviction or without from it is there any\nOne sitting you can think of that if you were to just pull it from the case would would have made it a slide the conviction\nSlide you say this law ... law\nNo no no because of this jury\nThe private let me say this\nThe prosecution when they presented scientific DNA evidence that Simpsons blood was founded the murder scene they did they did in fact prove Simpsons guilt beyond a reasonable doubt beyond all doubt\nBut where we were dealing here with the jury that was not operating with too much intellectual firepower number one number too many of them particularly the black years were probably biased and Simpsons favor however here's the key point\nA powerfully presented chase and summation which we didn't have here at all light years away from that where you put a bit on the jury and use spoons feed them can handle both of those problems but this was a problem jury no question about it and with the problem jury it's going to be difficult to get a conviction but you can do it you can do it\nWe're talking here about an F minus presentation and yet the first vote that this jury talk back in that jury room people tend to forget this a black journey white you're voted guilty on the first ballot doesn't emerging dollar an hour after the after the jury room if you can get a tend to\nWith an F. minus presentation you can imagine by ... what would have happened or if you had an a plus performance which the people in the state of California are entitled to I think almost assured\nLeaving a C a pardon even a C yeah\nYou had a guilty verdict or at a minimum a hung jury that\nYou'd have had problems with this jury unless you had an a plus performance the only type a jury the only type a jury that you can't turn around art\nIs the type a jury who state of mind is even though we know OJ's guilty or we don't care uh we like O. J. blacks have been discriminated against by white throughout the years we're going to get voted to free murders but let me tell you it would be extremely difficult\nTo find even wonder what that outrageous state of mind much less all twelve\nAnd and looking at the backgrounds with these jurors for instance the Simpson for person was in the Nineteen Ninety LA county employee of the year\nI'm listening to what they said on radio and TV reading a book written by three of them I get no sense that even one of them had that state of mind and I don't believe that for one single moment\nSo this was not the best jury but they would have responded to an a plus performance what happened here is that the prosecution allowed this jury to live with their conscience they did not eliminate for this jury all possibilities of symptom been found not guilty\nAll right uh had not the whole of the Rodney King business in the the riots and all the rest of the been hanging over this which was right or how much difference with that ...\nWell no question about it that affected the verdict but again again invariably we come back to the unbelievable incompetence of these prosecuting here's what Cochran Dick and it was duplicitous on his part and went right over the head of ... who's a black went right over his head\n... Cochran argued to this jury\nA police frame up from their experience of police brutality police brutality and ... frame of our two completely different types of misconduct Darden never distinguish these two types and the jury's mind\nUh what the black community has been experiencing throughout the years from a small segment of the LAPD and other major forces around the country maybe two or three or four percent that stay in the blue uniform of the other officers what they'd been experiencing is excessive force police brutality and then of course the police lie to cover it up okay that's what they've been experiencing\nFrame ups frame up by the police for burglaries robberies rapes murders\nVirtually virtually unheard of it's not that it's not common I Know this I've talked to enough black\nI've talked to people who work in the black community that's almost unheard of\nDid not see this issue time magazine did not see the times said well obviously it was easy for this jury to buy the frame of argument\nAll the jury had to replay in their mind is the tape of Rodney King get be getting beaten by the LAPD has the Rodney King getting getting beaten by the LAPD in the same thing as the LAPD in other words is if the LAPD beating Rodney King is essentially the same as they're framing OJ Simpson trial totally completely different types of police misconduct\nAnd it's my belief without knowing that\nThis jury back on the jury one was thinking this is the LAPD we know we can't trust them you know there's a reasonable doubt or they may have framed OJ instead of thinking to themselves wait a while yeah maybe we can't trust the LAPD for certain things but frame ops he's that's absurd\nI was on a San Diego radio last week and a fifty five year old black fifty five year old black woman called in and she was carrying and to me you know about the the the LAPD in the San Diego police department the mystery blacks and I said no ma'am\nAnd and she believe there is a frame of and all that I said man I'm going to ask you a question now and I want you to think about it I don't want you to answer right away I think about it before you answer your fifty five years of age I Want you to look back into your path as it ever happened to you or any member of your family any relative any close friends\nHave they ever been framed in other words are completely innocent the police come along if they ever been framed for a burglary or a robbery or rape arson or murder I'm not exaggerating art she paused for five ten seconds and these were words no\nShe hadn't thought about it you fall sure and and garden should have pointed this out to the jury it would have been in a looming eighty moment for all of them he didn't do it and went right over his head\nDuring look we're near the top of the army but I Want to ask you very quickly once the trial got underway was there you're targeting\nThat I Can't tell you I mean I I read I I don't know that that I Would always say you're you're\nTargeting are mean targeting by both sides were they both are or were they both playing games and blunders off they didn't think were a favorable to bear\nThat well yeah of course that it's not an every trial it's called a primary challenge where you don't have to give any reason whatsoever if you don't like the way someone looks at you the color of their time\nNo no I'm I'm Talking about once the trial was underway\nTrials underway yeah there was a little bit of that uh but it wasn't too successful because Ito was not a discharging people are ... unless he came up with some evidence of possible impropriety you know one of them was\nWell I'm recalling the or the ... the er the anonymous letter\nYeah right but I mean he was under the impression that perhaps this woman uh what's going to write a book and I wonder if she was or not I don't know but there was some evidence that went in that direction and uh yes the defense wanted to get rid of her of course 'cause she was perceived to be pro prosecute needle you know didn't just willy nilly a discharge are\nAlright ... were the top of the hour give me thirty more minutes 'cause I've got a couple more questions okay All right good ones and gee a boy and he is my guest you will be back in a moment used book outrage number one on the New York\nTimes best seller list right by the premier network Iraq\nWas hard road hosting goes to goes a long ... somewhere in\nYou love ESPN wants to live for and all of these shows are\nWith the original and the entire thirty preserve\nTime he's ten o'clock show their brothers tangy featuring find hard was deemed\nAll right about now to a Vincent ... Vinson thank you for staying I Know you've got an early interview a nonstop interviews I guess [laughter] um this again relates to the Sims\nIn trial it's an important question was there anything in ... track record or background that should have set off warning bills to guard city before selecting them to do the prosecution\nWell I had never heard of either one of them before but that that really doesn't mean anything 'cause we have a thousand prosecutors the da's office here in LA and there's one central office in about Eighteen outline offices or I have since learned that\nUh Clark was perceived to be among the top prosecutors dumped DA's office and no one that I Know that said that Chris darn was perceived to be a top prosecutor why he was brought on the run on the case I don't know he did handle\nThe a C colon calling a situation in front of the grand jury when the d._a. was contemplating seeking indictment against calling so he had a little background there because I was a an ancillary a part of this case whether colleagues would be indicted for being an accessory after the fact murder sure and then there was also the argument of whether he was a token black\nBut uh I can tell you a little bit about his background because I checked into it at least the seven years prior to the trial\nUh he told the jury I'm Talking about ... I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years well I happen to know that the da da da and the Rodney King situation was no exception I can just about guarantee you aren't that\nIf there hadn't been a tape there by that George holidays eighty one second tape Mm private citizen no one would have ever heard the name uh Rodney King\nA fact Rodney king's brother went to one of the foothills division of the LAPD the day after the the beating\nAnd this was before the LAPD knew about the tape and he um\nHe wanted to file a complaint against these officers in the death stars and said look your brothers and a lot of trouble there wasn't going to be any finally and again these four officers\nIn any event when guards and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking well wait a while is is this in the middle of the night or with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down in the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside Darden in the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting these misconduct cases here's what they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven the Nineteen Ninety four Darden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even the following the case or any lost it it's a thirty ninth adult in St case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThat was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trashed it looking for cracks and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it and lost that case and if you look at his book you mentioned is a lot of cases in S. I. D.\nAh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if you've read very closely as the thirty nine and dealt in St Louis so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nBut it's so then what are you saying because of color\nWhile I don't know I don't really don't know why does brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh\nUh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that when he told the jury I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth he was investigating bad cops for seven years but not prosecuting them\nAs long as public image was lousy uh as I watched the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip punish false hope so [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful Louis articulated there aren't\nLet me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors your case and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this but this type of thing you're aware of the ... the van ... ah bringing the vial of blood back to Iraq and have you're aware of that whole that whole issue\nOh yeah okay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a suspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a month later sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime of murder\nAnd I'm a ... so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here\nNow the the the\nThe defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however normally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist pursuant to the search warrant\nHere that hadn't been done yet\nA fun was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence surely a by number so if the book that while\nIt would have been item number one but the reason he didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting at Bundy and walking him it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you'd carried it around and had opportunity a impossible yeah right\nAh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dreamed that people like Shaq and Cochran are out there accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the forests\nNot one citizen complaint against them and twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife Rita to his farm in Indiana and he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence and a capital case in California and testify falls but you can get the death penalty yourself under one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument in in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a fan\nOut or brings the vile blood back to Fox and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminal is in their mind that's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why bought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into\nThe defense argument of please frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vile blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators to blood out of that violin planted that ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the\nTire case okay now there are several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about men had to bring in the fall blood back the Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring a vial of blood back the rock and obviously he put it in his suit pocket you wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to everyone that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense your point number two number two\nVan out are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham an Bundy their cameras blanketing the premise is picking up for the evening news all\nThe movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other arguments now what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive\nThan in the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark ... said one single word to\nTry to knock down this court the fence argument about band that are bringing the vial of blood back to Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue I check the transcript three times I had my wife checking cars rumbling and why so there's got to be some attempt to knock this now because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nArt when you get to the point when you don't even open up your mouth and under one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard\nI wouldn't say that you were incompetent incompetence of showing up for work and doing a bad job\nRight well I wouldn't want to build an even argue on it but they want to be showing up for what what about\nThe angle that a a ride Bennett are carried it out in the ... but a lot of people don't well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and took it over and planted it that's what a what\nSaw the glove ... the the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the bus\nThe murder thing before fun before from in front of a ride rapid two o'clock that's right and these these murders happened around a oath whether there's a disc right there there's a division of the women do but but somewhere somewhere between ten Fifteen\nAnd ten thirty five PM in the evening of given the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight\nOkay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there\nFor ... to pick up\nAnd deposit at Rockingham ... even if you wanted to even if you want it to frame Simpson by planning to go up there was no second glove there\nUnless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for for men now\nMind you Eighteen officers say they all they all made the statement at ... in in front of a a a internal affairs but but but Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling the other sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call it that stand the greater the likelihood that all Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case just to help someone most of whom\nThey didn't even know from why didn't you do the incompetence gross author complete I just I could give you an example here on the ... blood issues or nothing could have been more important than that she didn't even open up your mouth once\nShe's been convicted of riding murders but not the seven murders that the others demands and of course it's been convicted of nine\nAh Lesley then out may be rehabilitated but I don't know I you know uh uh I forget the girl's name the lady's name I'm Diane Diane Sawyer or had had a special right on that the girls in Nineteen Ninety\nFive I think are in Nineteen Ninety four and they made a good approach impression as millions around the country saw them and they form the conclusion that these are female defendants had been rehabilitated that's assume art for the sake of argument\nThat these girls are rehabilitate that this will never do it again or I'm not in any position to make any ... assessment of that I haven't seen them personally and since Nineteen Seventy one\nWhere people are are are not thinking clearly here is that there are still remain that when you're rehabilitated you're entitled to be set free is that that's the only reason why we incarcerate people certainly that's one of the reasons we put people behind bars\nIt all out of the management you know this punishment\nThat yeah there's two other reasons one wonders punishment a and when we talk about punishment we're talking about justice I mean people say justice is fine but retribution is bad you know that's prehistoric whatever it is but how can you have justice without retribution\nJustice is just that you have met a euphemistic way of saying retribution and punishment there's another reason why put people in hind bark and probably the main reason is deterrent to set an example\nThat's right we we put people behind bars we punish them to tell the prospect of criminals that if you violate the law you're going to be punished\nDodger fans were on a time listening when one last question should Charlie Manson ever see the light of

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades ... but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you\nFocus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was still you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew\nI was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examined my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this in my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little\nBit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here and a ...\nOver the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... you need that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhat I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIt's just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information in me why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional\n[laughter] and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything no\nOf course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you you have these experiences and union of their meal because usually they feel real you and he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined\nWhat an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all

is in ... you had already been teaching about this work\nYes yeah so um I was familiar with it but\nMost out of body experience to just be clear or or spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you taste that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nOr as cars science has been part of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and the norm all over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to the travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation both that has been used\nTo map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nMatter of fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively\nFor instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught and if you were interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's\nOne of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking and walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nTo literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional self right and have the kind of

Bonnie travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research and then ... says native or sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the ... e training at and then we'll Institute fishing ya and he's come up with a common let me put it to nominate on associated with these will be remembered somebody if you could explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years okay\nBut I've been studying this and practicing for forty\nOr just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and I've received sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences\nAnd this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar kinds of experiences that people were having or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm\nA floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but\nThere's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nUh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seeing through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at a for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body as your fell asleep\nSo that that's I see the ... on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles and nurse you're saying that's an out of body say\nNo I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out of phase from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take for granted no one you know there is no we we know about REM periods and we\nKnow about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life we're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate and you can observe this actually during it out of body experience\nSo what does it look ... image\nYou're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they are twitching and having all sorts of experiences\nOr they're moving their legs and the dream the cancer\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural as breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ...\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask a question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how would you know the difference between that and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple\nExperiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies and I was still learning what was going and I'm Still learning by the way you know one\nOf master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way\nA lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because\nThat's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nAn avid believer and anything like that especially a religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh eh we're all been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share a cause and that's an important aspect of this\nAnd it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of money doing things going on you know that people are required recount their cancer and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during the early teenage years why do you get in and get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down\nYeah we we were going to

I see it and I actually feel it\nOn ... my image to examples that well I can\n[laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future but\nWhat I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes\nI saw where it was that and we went back in there it was so\nI'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast and managed to Springs Colorado and he was hunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I knew was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California is a time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I mean ... Texas 'cause she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and your she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address and he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting because my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts by I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really\nRundown [laughter] extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we passed the house in five years after five years we could do whatever we wanted with the furniture\nOr the house ... what have you well after\nUs you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated\nAnd an artist you know and it's very iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going row yeah\nI actually called the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the ...\nAnd I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like\nThat while I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know things will allow\nFluently everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nBecause they were actually very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest Stephanie water I Am with the guardian listening to coast to coast am\nNa\nNa\nWhere mine\nEvery damn rivers weekday\nMornings it ate news radio five Seventy do when you ...

definitely waters and she is not only a professional surgeon or as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nYeah um I think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs\nFor spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nAnd the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nNeeding now had she seen the operation of this not since\nThe book has come out it was amazing during the time before the book yes oh yes she\nKnew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand sixteen\nBecause this theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nIn this book was reaching out that's currently trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes you seem to be the you like the public is for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I think of the main thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go to Dodger\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goals that likes the little girl that bounce the ball isn't she do I'm like no\n[laughter] leave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nNo no that's not if they are they're just kicking you being a trick there it's here they are\nIn prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the ... and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning\nBut I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hidden lends\nItself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and then the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks and the lead into the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you're living in now on to them to do much of a non ... we didn't cash the ghost follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to err on time because whenever I Would walk underneath ... lights they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know it'd be certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said [laughter] yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing my show in the if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYeah yeah because I happen to you too I mean I've heard that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping of life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nDid you notice that what happened to other people who are just you know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nYou're trying to say it's happening it wasn't so\nThey're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do to make it sound like you don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage the springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's\nThe essence part right there oh yeah you know the family hotel right there on that a native ... very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even at the heart with ... with the infrared cameras at night time that you can see it light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains very thick Atlanta it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine of thing right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the pikes peak they believe that enable at the end I find that fascinating because maybe at some point\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very limited pikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it\nAnd

love to hear more from William welcome\nTo the show and thanks for joining me William\nHi how are you feeling good good\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such an eye out of body has ventured idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so I explored them and for\nIt took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first holy conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your\nFamily you had your entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of\nTrump right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise or that I\nThat I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your ... he will get you go what did you experience how did you know it is sad to see him\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um\nI was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not collide I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm\nIt went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this in my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing\nMay um but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment with a little bit shocking I was a newbie\nI had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist and also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional\nWhen I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that were in\nIt doesn't stop it couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all of the tens information's in the in ... why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you know one of anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because ... he'll meal you [laughter] you blame them because they're usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by thought and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols\nAnd it's uh it's amazing but that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves which is very important\nNow your classes you teach them and really to tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great it is urging him\nOnly twenty four people can attend it's a world renowned\nAs being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop I'm generally what I mean each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um when is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAm in ...\nWhile we were\nWhile now I'm ...
