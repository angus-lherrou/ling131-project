I'm I'm all for practical purposes\nWell I think uh this is just to hazard a guess but walled from what you've told me of the condition of the whale or it's not something you'd carve up and take home for the dinner table\nIt was pretty rank I don't know how long the thing that's been dead but it was kind of ... you know\nOh my God ... that's ... that's all well listen I don't know how to thank you

Baldwin, Pennsylvania with violence in firearms offenses federal hate crimes in connection with the eleven people he's accused of shooting the debt injuring six others at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning FBI's Bob Jones is they believe the alleged shooter acted alone\nReginald Ernest all and Mr often from Oxford University right Mr Alton came in and just for the press conference\nAnd they announced the result of their review or they tore no that was found and Vince fosters briefcase almost a week after he died piece together twenty eight pieces\nAnd they concluded or three of them\nDidn't know was a forgery\nA forgery yes Vince I'm I'm going to ask you to do something\nBecause in light of this news I Would say the content of the letter\nAnd I remember the content of the letter the content of the letter was in my opinion very very suspicious ... well I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could've come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do what you read it to us please\nA or have I caught you by surprise that just a matter of reaching the cross here okay well I figured somewhere you'd have that I'm I'll tell you what I'll tell you know I mean let me read it I have it right\n[noise] maybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd and I'll tell you what does a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that\nI doubt it you got yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct\nIncluding any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual what specific group [noise] the FBI lied and they report to the Eighteen to practice covering up the legal benefits they receive from the travel off\nA GOP has lied and misrepresented the knowledge and its role uncovered prior investigation the ushers office plotted to have a cough Kurt taking advantage cocky at a chart the public will never believe the innocent\nFor the Clinton and they're loyal staff the wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job or the outline of public life and want to hear ruining people it's considered a sport\nAnd that's it that's it\nThe part that really grabbed me was they I Am just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed often said you know he had any crime you have a note that suddenly appears wanted there needs to be such a duck and then it seemingly benefit from ... it's just immediate cause for concern and of course here you have so many\nThe state and federal all the experts bleak statement had been taken from\nThat he had ... maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together\nA good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo they're trying to Ford well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because Vince Foster apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for a good by world\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary no never the less I mean some are rising everything to this point and it was some something in mind without having that suicide it did sound kind of final summation of failure or however you want to look at it\nThere at the press conference there were a number of reporters a number of TV networks I don't think the grand on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story he had been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC oh really yeah how\nCould they possibly ignore evidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division but what about the other is and what about the\nAssociated Press and what about you know I mean does the\nPress the major news outlet the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a full news story or at least dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the light that they usually do on these type of story and the a\nP uh editors from Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they save us cuckoo paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster noticed through aside the government\nCan vote otherwise blah blah blah but\nThis is now the title of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that Holden okay\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled that that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like there are any note to one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what the park police and the FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I quote in my article but you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know he wanted a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only that was funny that you know the liberal vi\nCrime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows they may be a lot of crime going on there\n[noise] [noise] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration that it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great qualify for fishing because\nIs found in a briefcase the search the police that that they were suspicious of the fact that that brief case searched twice and was empty enough power and looked at it\nSecond it um benefited or people at the White House and took the onus up proving the suicide third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it\nIt is often times an effort to make the comparison\nDifficult difficult sure do already\nYou have a primary ... at the English experts at\nA physician then you look at the no and the first of all the note if you look at the no which we have a photocopy of and we had a huge blow up a right and comparing you can see that they did not match that\nThe way the stroke structures are done the flow the slant\nOf the letter is not the fame\nSo then from a clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nWhile it is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom\nYou've rounded out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut ... born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down he'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top and bring them around and you can see that from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter ... for example\nUm was done in three stroke structured stroke\nUnlike foster who had a very tenuous and the style of writing uh-huh what she's saying oh we had a dolphin document that week or two\nOr three different fourth I'm so\nVery very clear that we\nAh that that that they will eat isn't a match\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nLike you like me like anybody who's got anything to do was saying what we're saying right now but\nThis has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things aren't you you want based on

there you're talking about a third rate burglary for some the various political purpose\nHere you might be talking about the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved in a story was manufactured\nOr murder\nOr whatever it is it doesn't it isn't even if just this with bird and the FBI to their proper procedures and investigating that belief used an examiner to certify the document that that never a certified as a handwriting expert\nUh\nSo obviously no one really care to properly investigated\nMr ... one of the experts formerly with the New York city police department was on the house committee for assassination and he was the one that ... that are found the palm prints of we are being on the rifle a she is an expert in late fingerprint\nA note was torn for the audience and the reporters it's twenty eight ... ...\nAnd they showed how many fingered had come in contact with different piece of paper mistrust and we said his statement that this is consistent the fact that they had no fingerprint for only the pressure on these papers it's consistent with the person to toward having worn gloves\n[noise] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic story so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I Know this is touchy territory Chris writer\nWell the aid packet today\nPromise the number of people that call on the media world here in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch\nOne of the problem here is that no matter you know an Ambrose Evans ... the great reporter from the in the British telegraph and he has said you know if we had a video someone murdering Vince Foster they still wouldn't believe it Ambrose just published a story this Sunday wasn't carried on the a P\nI Wonder why about a witness that was important Marshfield tonight foster died he came in he was the first one to spot forced his car\nAnd he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man that's sitting next to last his car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him if he or an added to the park and this um witness left immediately um the\nPark police never went and visited him to interview him they spelled his name wrong in the police report you know\nWhen the FBI visited with him the FBI civil who was the man that gave you manage thing look it's a Mexican American man and the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify it would be unable to identify on the line up or a composite sketch who this man what\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw the park the FBI out and out lie in their report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake if it happened one when we have so many instances and that's ...\nYou know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man in and around forced his car they set it on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to what the hood up just before the body without\nAlright look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know if in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery thing then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm I'm not convinced that you're safe\nUm well you know there's there's risk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take the thrift because in the very important story\nAnd uh uh you know the trip for half the pool where they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that ah when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of sun to this though I mean what what\nWell look if in fact a this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose\nAgain\nYeah I guess that's what I was saying well look and look what\nYou know here Mike Wallace did the teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards ... ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money never won at the big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and it makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah\nI took a pay cut to continue doing this story um so what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I'd never reported that foster with left handed a first that with the Boston Globe\nI was going to be held responsible for every ... rather than a newspaper ever done in this case um eat only in the Cape to people out there that to look into it that\nI'm On the right track and only indicates to me I'm On the right track when they have to make ... a ... near one Mike Wallace seems almost eighty years old at the dean of American television journalism has to bring down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\nWell ... if we look at it from the other direction\nThe implication is that I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control of very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but\nYou you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the Associated Press under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nI'm an because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I have not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it sends a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the king media I don't know if everyone but the king media the the leaders on sixty minutes the lead program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer sixty minutes saying that he helped get plenty of what Clinton elected\nAfter the Jennifer Flowers thing that he edited that tape and such a way that he remained recast Bill Clinton candidate\nUm you know ABC News is a very close association with this administration of former Clinton campaign advisor or was that of the news for a while recap ...\nUm you know you see these these connection with\nClintons are not good at governing ah but they're very good at dealing with the media handling\nThe seat in is spinning and [noise] All right look I'm going to end the interview here and I'm going to give out the

of areas he looks to be a fiscal conservative and a social middle of the rotor\nMoore a Republican or Democrat but it's getting hard to tell these days you know so if we get a Clinton do Powell race I guess it might begin to be appropriate because I think that's what it's going to be to ask you which way you would be inclined to go\nSo why would you be inclined to go [laughter] [noise]\nI really

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out a gym that I think it's kind of you if you can test and said yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying well for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck up for their belief all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible such a great works of literature and plays is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh in the population using under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\n... Halloween a ... the the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where the they see a kind of bumps like that or is it just is like is it I mean I really do they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days October\nOh massive massively I mean some some business is only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more ... more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country\nSo they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go\nWell I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there and they can make their entire year in the week that the teacher is open I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but but the other but what they're realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on over the course of a year\nThat now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house open to the monster museum until they're starting to realize that they can do this year round as failing grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know ... or to or how they want the truth just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring that especially like ... year round the only other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance the er the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time 'cause they're just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic tables and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts that do that there's there's on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks in there to kind of tell people hey the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally lately and ten pm\nYeah I Believe it's a ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah the ...\nLet's get some pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight around an alley\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the which in our\n[laughter] as bad [laughter] really that that\nBut they got to get them up before the ... or maybe that's the real wishing happens after all the tourists lead Jay double the locker\nA and a Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much aid season with the which the magic and may have Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thanks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter] All right I have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to Ross well in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that\nComing up later on in November when I'll be\nBack on Halloween of starting on Thanksgiving weekend\nOn coast to coast am All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget\nThe men from the train next on coast to coast am this is he in\nThree years ago making a murderer became let the TV show of\nForce in nature and uncovered rained injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely death on it and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan nasty trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am to park to overeat budding emerge\nReminding a murderer is now on the ... I Hope radiolab just open the Avon\nPlace it is that those narratives are so good and there are so valuable but why and that's what I studied\nAnd one of the things I learned that sets true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment\nYou know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\n[noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged in allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means\nStories that inflamed the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part\nIn the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore her death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing\nAn ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or to satisfies the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine\nWhen we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up torch bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such\nThings I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were a conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media would be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing stave victims centric in the stories\nThat you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men\nFrom the train discovering America's most

Eighteen Ninety eight now and knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is they uh\nUh the uh vi Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and break through his head and I had\nBeen achieved that had been done to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\nMen from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot\nThese stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person than ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the\nThe the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that was an alcoholic serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which will runner and while he was killing a lot of people but\nThe earlier crimes we what we did was\nSay look this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow getting started walking back toward the first crime\nThat's what I've gotten as nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all of them are ...\nI had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits to first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years honeybee out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky and that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New York and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in that\nAnd because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the uh with uh with with the last last murders and the series so are we\nIs just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime then successive Lee after that\nIt is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times you were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five the ah I think that he while he used\nAn axe to commit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and confronted him but um and it was not what he was trying to do but it is why he would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answered the question is a crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about\nA all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey're\nThey're part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so we cover them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that\nWe are ashamed of the uh uh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime by by the way at the last book I read was the real crime but with the real Lolita\nOr it's a book by um [noise] ... ah I Believe it's Weinstein I could have a last name or or the uh I I just screwed up her name I'm\nSorry you know there surely going to be his\nHand and one of the things I've learned from reading at the white American ... who was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports I mean that's I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what who we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try and do positive things\nI hang on hang on to that thought on crime stories in this world picking up the men from the train discovering most Americans most elusive serial killer and there's

and writing demands from the train because he likes to write about crime so do you want to finish that I\n[noise] you're you're fading out I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no can have that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime that night\n[noise] [noise] yeah they are uh I was saying the crime stories are fascinating too it's because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about\nThe case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate thoughtful entry into the subject\nI just got up like a fish\nOr I was I was I\nSaw a documentary about the murders and below Scott Iowa called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary far above normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was missing\nWhich is that it's relatively ... that's ... ... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put an hour and to and to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a weak the weak eventually became five or six years\nOr so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is that true crime\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit riding preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nThey would do a sermon just before the execution then we try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk and became became an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it was a hundred plus years later in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved\nBut for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they pay that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who uh was a\nA a ... his great great aunt had been\nWas one of the victims of the crime that he had always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book back in our book that uh um\nIt wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief twelve yeah it was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a show he said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow\nI I don't know why it was important to him too well\nI understand the understanding sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it I'm ... I've I've I don't know if there's a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think we can go ahead go ahead no please no a lot of the book and a lot of that\nBook is about is is that all all all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\nThat these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive at was whether they are or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small have a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened to all of the things that happened to you and me and people have our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they\nThey got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that\nHappened who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to\nCreate a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they let die terrible bath and also I was trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... the inverted pyramid\nOf journalism and you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the tone for\nThe um the things that people age or the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are and then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that oath trait that point you're just back then and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co ... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um\nA he had uh\nWitnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors and an entire community um a pickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nSee a ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way that tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important to him a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know

I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a a while he had he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation of his ...\nI if I were around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a finger pretty open like the uh but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents screwing about his life\nThe um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there had been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do as to whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy's sounds like the most dangerous kind\nA sociopath ... are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because it was not um [noise] it it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that he was he was a truce hike up\nA psychopath have no fear ever known norm at do not have normal fear and one thing that the parent about this the ... the ... and the trade is that\nThe from his crime that he was not even not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with these bizarre I\nThis is probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller them after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and going to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about\nThis this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacity so we moved on in front of the book but\nThere is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also those Clinton minimum to [noise]\nUh and I made throughout history question about the Boston sprinkler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give you the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now for coastal zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... am done ...

Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts he a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping\nHe became a at Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen Kenny transition to just running loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money at one of the ways you know it's him is the lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a he he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery in and it yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you know drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would it would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crimes he just drop the accent left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they acts\nA bucket of water before leaving a fan of crime you did that in ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career they\nAh ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on or see a but it just dropped the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nUnconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected him to the murders\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat it still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean that there's any occupation where somebody could watch the next day would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up on mine\nBut they all ... among those who did it work as a matter but then there are\nSome of the I think he did\nAt the accidents that he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an axe that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house I see the murders\nWere uh were houses burn would sometimes coal\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWell see now that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nThinking print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had an ... when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah that's why I connect to the story

it's cold a lot of the year and he he didn't\nHe didn't read all ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier is limited to South Korea um\nThe uh that

supposedly taken off of the trains and there was I Believe a total of five bodies found\nAnd um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in his position he was asked to go ahead and look at this and this is one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly\nTony ... you know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah\nThey um uh I I I Know exactly what it is not covered actually Cleveland the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness or after the\nUh what what hired to try to solve a series of a\n... and I I've been named by which the yet right is\nA crime series is now and they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of the crimes at some length in in a popular crime\nBut that is it's not it's not ... they were they were acts murders they were directed to train the but it it's twenty or the or it's twenty five thirty years after\nThe crimes that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about

that\nUh and I just real quick about a Lizzie Borden she killed or a she if she did it used to play to the act and you said the other guy use the blonde and so that would be I guess that'd be something else against it but want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if\nYou're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell all types of stuff like that I mean there had been some sort of a picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about it later he just\nBlew into and out of town and do whatever I Want to know who he was you know when you when you buy buy it that's a really big on the first crime everybody\nKnew everybody knew what he looked like and he was a very unusual looking man\nBut for some reason that we can't figure out no one ever did that we can fine no newspaper that we can fine ever did a drawing of and then posted it and I don't know why they didn't do it it was common practice and and the wild west in the same era\nThe it was ... it was commented dude drawings of criminal in that case there are drawings
