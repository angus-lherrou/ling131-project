defensively don't you think oh yeah coverage there where they're supposed to be the answer going up when they should\nJust a great defensive show here tonight as a fact James Jackson or what's your question the defensive and some [noise]\nAnd why she will burn a time out so the pain was like I'm Out and they saw defense downstate\nSo we're pretty good shape caught up on time every thirty seconds that only a thirty second anyway so support down insects for South Dakota and other going to have to throw it here oh our coverage and the secondary smalls\nAnd ... and all the quarter is really it's really been tied coverage\nThat's interesting that you take a look a couple of a big place in the first half\nDefensive coordinator was going to do this you have a couple of those linebacker blitz so wouldn't be surprised if you get out of that Nicole show that dime look when you read the offensive linemen and throw up some kind of a linebacker lips to get the quarterback space 'cause they\nThey need a couple of seconds here this is not up to yard completion they need six right so you know linebacker blips a couple of guys rushing should be good here [noise]\nFourth down six from the penguin thirty five yard line with fourteen\nMinutes ... seconds is the fourth quarter the\nYou know there's somebody move\nThis makes it more difficult yeah [noise]\nSo forth and six becomes fourth down in a

pot posts comes over Texas is a fourteen yard line [noise] so why is you get to the ball back if their own fourteen yard line exactly\nWas leading twenty to ten\nBe offset it could be a face mask [noise] what Nathan ... as a whole new Russia's for ten yards\nWe've got two flags and one for sure is going against the penguins the other could be against the defense\nThe one in the back against the bank was Bob boy was that a lake flag right they made it was all the way to the outside probably two seconds away from whatever happened in the middle there I think it was holding where that is down here looks like it's a face mask probably obscenity penalties\nFor targeting that it was it was not sure what they're going to call down there who will fall in the play the plight of us are targeting has been picked up\nHowever holding\nOffice number Seventy\nThan your panel they respond or for your spot\nRepeat first down so they picked up a flag which they initially thought was targeting\nAnd it'll be only one penalty and that will go against white issue for holding [noise]\n... but I Do have some breaking news down here on the sideline Montgomery van quarter out for the

Dr\nExcept for that whole mistakes hopefully within thirty\nSix or we could pick this up we could even overcome that you're holding penalty\nPhase the quarterback pastor Dale\nThree wide receivers will take it and will run it inside and will not get the first down to the ball came out in South Dakota says they have\nSo many caster bubbles and the\n... say they've recovered it and they have\nSo there will be no decision to go forward on fourth down or kicking field goal because the coyotes with seven fifty one remaining get the football back\nThe good news is we we took almost seven minutes off the clock and although it's a bubble they're going to start at their own twenty yards I'm more of a ... that's such a good job holding on to the football but it just came out late and South Dakota where there was a ...\nIf you don't know Bob now passing point ... mace was not showing us the backup quarterback this week so right now many reps that he'd get with that first off so runny runny runny runny runny and there's okay it's the same old thing that made them passing wise when they had a past that time\nMaybe he doesn't have that in the arsenal because\nNot enough time in

got up to a heavy side for me I felt that he looked like a song they\nSay well you know I did I did the all night program and then without sleep by flew to Portland and sign books from I think twelve thirty in the afternoon to about eight thirty at night right so you're right I was his army you at eight o'clock to where I'm Wondering if the family we were like what noodles\nBoy it was great I have two things to mention the a flammable water Oh yes in Washington\n... a year or two ago I I heard on the news where they had built a park over land fail mhm and because of the gas underneath the ground when they turn the water fountain I may have flammable water\nNot good I don't know if that's true or not but that's what I heard another thing right here in Portland somebody has come up with the idea because of the drugs and the young folks they\nOught to a drug test the young folks when they go in for a driver's life Mm and that's okay that that's fine that's why not test everybody if they're going to get his young folks\nWill lie I I I'll tell you why I I think why I'm it's probably because of the Fourth Amendment in other words they probably figure constitutionally they can get away with it when it's a minor\nBut goes to ... they probably a cannot get away with it when it's a um somebody who's a a you know become Twenty one age of consent\nIs that so that's just a guess okay\nWell it just feels that it's fair to me or that they would do it to the young folks and not others because there's\nA lot of young adults that well I got ... let me try this out on you if they were to test everybody everybody I went to get a driver's license how many drivers percentage wise do you think would immediately be off the road\nIt ... percent [laughter] okay well I had to lighten

that's a cause either that kind of goes into the hopper now with pollution the ozone all the other things they think might be possible\nThe main thing I wanted to point out was up in this neck of the woods what with the the way yes and the ocean shipping that comes up to dilute we've had a lot of problems with things kind of piggybacking their way into our ecosystem\nAnd Europe causing problems and said well that's why I can only hope that\nNothing is or ride that developed a taste for a human being [laughter]\nSee that's why I'm a little concerned about the plans in Australia to let loose

of scandals hear him\nA lawyer a man fought for his country spent three years of hospital it came out voters whole lot to this country um\nWell I think why do you think he is so far behind in the polls\nWhy do I think Yes sir I I I think are\nToo many people don't really rely on their thing and don't look enough\nAnd to the candidate to really figure out who the man is and they rely on TV and network\nTV Mars ABC CBS and ... and ah NBC mhm\nI I think they have a very big biased I don't know of there's there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh most people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on\nTV that is true and I I think it's a shame [noise]\nWell I appreciate your calls her and uh we'll see what others have to say I'm\nSo you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people than not get their news from the media from the major media\nAh what do you think what are the rest of using the a tactic taken by the ... campaign of late has been to attack the president with regard to the donations made by the Indonesian company\nA liberal do you think of why do you think that is not a\nWell I don't think that he is electable this year if that answers your question he is not going to be elected\nAnd you think he's going to run again\nUm I don't know uh it's a good question he may allow another candidates or to have the reform party\nNext time and I I really think it's it comes down to that that he will allow because if he runs he will be the candidate yeah in my opinion so uh if you sets\nReform party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOK and just one thing when you had the two candidates from the the other parties like uh the libertarian yes thing that I'm scared about that this guy gets in there if he if they have their way you can imagine\nThat the sweatshops Thirteen year old girls are working twelve hour shifts a lot of safety features will go out the window let alone or legalizing drugs which I think it's crazy\nI um we have to have some government yup\nI I Do agree sir I Believe me I Do agree\nI Am very much in the middle and I do agree I Am not able to embrace libertarian philosophy and I really really really like Harry brown use the real thing he believes in what he says I just happen not to agree with all of it\nAre two important non trivial points one is legalized drugs very bad idea in my opinion and the other is open borders or we have

been kind of bugging me for the last couple of weeks um I was reading an article about a high school student that was just panic from school because she gave a classmate might all\nUh I don't think it was mine all but it was an aspirin yes\nUm that's just kind of um you know kind of throw with me and it took me why in the devil did they tend to forget given ...\nWell their rule was a no student will give any other students any drug over the counter or otherwise that was the rule\nOh OK answer that did that get trained at all [noise] yes\nYeah because I thought I read something that a Kurd to another student in a different school that are either Tylenol or an Advil or something like\nThat and exactly defended that student to they've uh well I think they found it in a locker ... and I thought\nWell I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but um\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I went on the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call [noise]\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other student had had some sort of allergy to that medicine then there would have been a real problem\nThere would have been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rules are a little bit strict yes but ah probably proper and they wanted the school nurse to dispense any medicine west of the Rockies you're on the air hockey oh about yes stepping\nIn Albuquerque New Mexico yeah later on fine good I've had to a couple of factors\nOff and on the past month or two I don't know if

away now\nYes that's true ah I happen to hear it gets a little bit of your program put the two gentlemen Libertarian Party\nYes in the uh the taxpayers party\nRight and at that I didn't happen here if either one of them are getting about half a treaty fat tests Clinton has helped her get with the United nations\nMm well the United nations was mentioned I don't think specific treaties\nYeah there there too that um I don't think most people are very aware of them because they're the media doesn't talk about the Clinton now he doesn't talk about them but there is to treat it had to pick up the treaty on the right to the child and the other one that's on biodiversity\nY'all actually treaties are not something that Clinton or any other president can just entered into right treaties require ratification by two thirds of the Senate if they are literally treaties\nExactly and probably the reason they haven't been ratified is because we had a Republican in there that have been you know keeping a check and balance on the\nUs and if we're smart we will keep Republicans in their\nAbsolutely that that's the thing I'm hoping for that at least to Clinton is reelected a\nI'm a realist and I I Do believe he is going to be reelected I'm I'm not here to be a cheerleader I'm reading the tea leaves the way I think they're dropping and so I my feeling now is to concentrate on keeping the checks and balances in place\nAbsolutely um I I Would be interested in people uh you know comedy if\nThey have heard anything about the uh the killer a treaty by either trying to uh get more information about myself but kept when you are down there to find out what they really pay a you know they're going to take the softer yet the United states completely away\nAll right well let's see

team\nIs the author of living the paradox them in late ... and his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we describe this I mean he was not just a skeptic of after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred\nOf for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics\nWe're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that\nYoung student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and they would have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer who take a picture and\nAnd ah you know the fake media would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh yeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... is there Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research brings it into the than says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research\nPreparing for the ... and that's why people say this so this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again not ease the water for this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just did it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor goody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do you know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight\nOnly once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement\nThe end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted\nThrough a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\n[noise] tell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that vice

email\nUm people arguing back and forth a um because for many people this was such a new information here we go again this time FDR and I expect\nA sort of a similar reaction um these who murdered books I mean how\nHow do people received them obviously you know people are they're they're flying off the the bookshelves people are buying them but do you get also some pushback because\nYou're you're this is kind of uncomfortable for some people you're you're pulling their their reality out from under them\nYeah I'm really I'm playing with people's normalcy by it and they don't like it [laughter] you know people like it um\nYou know people always kind of lead the first story we're told you know I'm only some of the story was first told them I was born in one of your work to a victory\nBut um you know a lot of history has been Santa Claus oh you know and people don't like it when you re investigate things and ah and wipe out all the luck out from under the age in the\nCage the the things that I write I as I've saturated by history and I just ... ... what have you been out there just because I haven't heard of you know like a question about who's in our life is going to have a northwest All right\nSo I have to be very careful when I write the books not to fall into confirmation bias on commission biased hearings on education\nI'm finding just the fact that you want to continue that sort of you who have\nThat can be very careful not to fall into that because out of every four or five books that I start to look into that one might make it\nWith the information that I find so it's not like I just say well that's right [laughter] it's not worth the anthem actually makes you were asked to go so far right\nNow in the case of FDR um you know this is Seventy almost Seventy five years ago three quarters of a century I mean was it or was it difficult at this stage in the game to to reopen this very very cold case\nWell they're always difficult because I never want to know that there's a germ students read all of us like truth justice\nAnd we and our way and you don't want to bring anything sinister is going on a you know behind your back and so so they're all they're all\nThey're all I just I just mean finding the documents I'm Sorry say again\nI I just mean finding the documents or uncovering the the the real facts of the case after all this time\nWell what I did as a I went through the laws about mansion and upstate when Hyde Park New York which was a terrific place we have the experience to go and spend an hour or two it was a beautiful place in the Roosevelt mansions on your ... over overhead is the national archives show I just want a tremendous amount of\nTime with ... or ... when the ten years with top secret previously\nAnd they're huge files there on the hour and a his wife Eleanor ... there's that's where you grow up filing cabinet right in the middle or the animals crawl over actually that and I want to Roosevelt\nAnd actually the communism she was being investigated being investigated for being a comment so you know it's it's who you will never had that information years ago you know\nSo that's one of the majority are we going promotional came from is from the original documents and I'm joined out to be a better way to reach that expires robbing people the wrong way I think everybody Rob somebody wrong way for doing something you know I don't really young I mean listen [noise]\nRight well truth is often uncomfortable it's a it's it's not about necessarily making people feel good it's it's like a scorpion sometimes things um but you need this to say\nYou don't paint a flattering picture of of FDR you mentioned a communism although you know let's be honest communism was was kind of the fat back then before people knew I guess the real truth about what was happening in Stalin's Russia and the er the programs in the ... the the forced\nA started nations in the Ukraine and so forth um but um let's let's talk about a young FDR talk about someone born with a silver spoon in his mouth\nA paint me a a a a portrait of a young FDR\n... you know yeah I was a I always say he was beneficiary of the lucky ... this guy was\nBorn in the week who\n[laughter] you know I mean is it they were just sitting in the news was old world well\nMean there are ground where a quarter mile down the road is the Vanderbilt man\nYou know they're on some basic parcel of land I mean to say that this guy was ... and ... and had every single thing if you have the desired was an understatement um you know they had other anyone people at nothing so um he was a\nYou know it was ... was out around does not establish student\nUm sees all the way through school or he'd grab the roof off and go play football and so forth and uh it was a well I think it was well was it I Want to use but he was a it was something that was really a\nVisual or something I think anyone is there for the ashtray and his political where it started out in the Los about men and help them make decisions and they blossom them being governor of you are a lot of people don't know what I was governor early or edited forgot but they're just not\nTalking about it anymore you know you know he was an old man now he just cause I Know [laughter]\nOver Roosevelt was born a Roosevelt maybe Roosevelt fighter Roosevelt which is a little odd or the woman got hit a change in a monitor ... part of life actually [laughter] no um no I mean\nThis is the evolution of gift person\nShould at least his cousin teddy was his was a distant cousin was he a second or third cousin\nThinking it was a second ago right and and he was he was a Republican how did he was a Republican how did he perceived as younger cousin the Democrat\nWell they got along really well I'm actually our father wasn't too thrilled about that\nBecause that was just not the way but he was raised with a that Roosevelt name was trying to fight if he was a recording early a boat or you know the special in that comes\nOut so you get a lot of things are without unsavory would ban some self marrying it's passed on on funding a number\nBoth of you know that in public there's awful lot of ways so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also a governor of New York closet you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch daddy I mean he didn't have\nUm ... sort of I I think of George Bush a senior\nIn trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the er the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous TV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nSo I mean propaganda in those those were done you know it's just maybe it was smaller and\n[laughter]\nThings so much on the on the white\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which are seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um\n\nI'm struck point the exchange debate in which the president was going to be one in March coaching\nYou might have been going back to watch over Ninety three which like the rules are at a way to go watch so what's mystery\nThing on the hundred days and they still just a hundred [noise] um [noise]\n[noise] right he had it before I had a four month a head start or let's say well let's take a timeout will come back Steve and talk about the new deal

your guest host Richard Sayre is that's a\nPretty version of across the universe David Bowie\nI'm here to tell you folks are maps are all wrong all the wrong and a a a scientist has created a representation of what the world really looks like\nA true map of the world and you can check it out it's a posted in the in the news section of the coast to coast am dot com or webmaster shot a store a tonight is all over that and he's a posted that there are many countries for example including Russia and Canada are are not nearly as big as we think\nAnd the problem is it's very difficult to portray the reality of a ... world on a flat map and so you get this distortion\nIt's called their Mercator projection map or the most commonly seen hanging in classrooms in textbooks it was created back in Fifteen Ninety six I think it's maybe time we have to wait and see what was it was designed to help sailors navigate the world ... ... the Mercator projection buddy distorts\nSeriously distorts the size of land masses\nSo for example you may have noticed that a while Africa is around fourteen times larger than Greenland and yet on the map\nBoth are almost the same size Greenland is huge on these maps Brazil another example Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska yet Alaska is much larger than Brazil on the map much larger\nThe map also suggested Scandinavian countries are larger than India whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together\nIt looks like Europe is larger than North America on on these old maps but in reality the reverse is true\nRussia isn't as large as its depicted with Africa larger than Russia in reality so if you want to see the world is it really is represented on a map you want to check out this

Stone twenty Thirteen he came out with a series the other side of history I Believe a DVD\nSir yes yes he he came to the exact same thing in this book was\nWas in the middle of writing this back then are researching it at least as I Do all my own research and you know he came up with his own research to substantiate the same thing so it wasn't a matter of if it was just a matter of one\nThat had happened\nAnd so uh Ghana or did he let it happen beauty while in part I suppose he was sort of and they were prodding the Japanese maybe cornering them a little bit but how much more knowledge do you think\nHe had at the actual attack\nIt's difficult to tell I Know they had at least a week's notice and you know the aircraft carriers mysteriously went out of Pearl Harbor\nSo they were not at Pearl Harbor when the attack happened which has a little sister suspicious you know aircraft carriers tend to be a pretty\n... pretty unnecessary commodity in a word like that and every word actually so you know they had to spare them so they left the harbor if I'm wrong\nSorry but I mean I I Can't imagine a situation where uh you would be taking aircraft carriers and ordering them away from a place that you're supposed to be protecting so\nIt was pretty good evidence to support that uh you know the same you know to support that conclusion that said\nThey definitely had a as a matter of fact the History Channel broke it I think last year I was watching something on the History Channel they even said they had uncovered documents internal documents which I didn't find the archive suggests that that very thing that the codes were broken and I thought wow\nHey look at that you know I mean I I hate I knew I got it right but I didn't know how to write I got it so that was ...

J. B. and\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd we're back with Stephen ... author of who murdered FDR which is part of the who murdered series previously Steve joined us on coast back in August to discuss the murder of Elvis Presley or now we're discussing the murder of\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt the thirty second president um before we get into the the the second World War I just wanted to mention Mussolini and um there was a time when ... and I don't I don't believe you address in the book but FDR\nWas also a a an admirer of Mussolini or when he first came to power because Mussolini was kind of build as a um as a real progressive um you know he was ... and he wrote for the communist newspaper Mussolini did in his I Believe is propaganda minister was sort of the\nUm one of the top a communist thinker so you know fascism in its early beginnings they were communists that's just the way it is it's a fact\nUh and and I think they kind of ... a mutual admiration society going back and forth I think um when Mussolini was still writing for this worker party magazine he admired Roosevelt Roosevelt wanted to send a delegation over to Italy to see how they did things so I I just thought that was kind of an interesting chapter but um\nWhen they entered the war Roosevelt wanted\nA pact with the Soviet Union to kind of squeezed Germany how did that I did go over with Churchill\nWell when it first started to address which will anything you're absolutely right with that as a matter of fact Hitler also idolized Mussolini at first it was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that you lost um\n[noise] so America gets into the war Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through a tube on New Britain bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham I'm very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nClose England cans are losing their island they were lined up on the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go in late on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France\nAnd they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain them of course it didn't because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to have met previously and I'm Churchill really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church who is the one who got the two\nTogether but he he just hated the fact that the Americans because\nThey were so similar at the time\nStalin in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be friends\nSo you know to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been as fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure I\nMean there's ... there's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and [laughter] you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their pieces are ... million\nFDR it seemed in reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStolen didn't need us we need it Stalin Stalin didn't need us he was already\nYou know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and installing a pack well Hitler violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on that on march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and\nHe decided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we know anything\nAbout Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like thirty some odd different drugs are so he was such\nA delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his\nGenerals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and he'll just says well I don't care I Want to do it so Stalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran\nI think in a list terrain in Nineteen forty three and a game of them were forty three correct they had even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still looks pretty robots or you know he you know by by standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy by by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by Stalin spelling has the puppet master he uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish\nIn his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than\nA he was to keep the party's journals use the column comrade or was it con Conrad index card\nUsed to call him a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party one by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy\nWas it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was standing stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that and it's a quote from London's will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after ... death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson again taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in coast to coast them [noise]\n[noise]\n\nEvery weekday morning radio five seven [noise] [noise]\n[noise] how can I can

black after death I couldn't I\nJust couldn't find anything to substantiate that claim but you know what nothing would surprise me the history of poisoning of a opposition leaders is is absolutely incredible we haven't even talked about this year um it was it's been used as a legitimate weapon sense three thirty one B. C.\nI got everyone from a recipe it into the apostle John in the Bible and poison and political poisonings hit their peak right around the renaissance Italian Renaissance on the fourteenth century and even today food tasters are used to certain navigate that um you know everything [laughter] and\nHere's some people who have actually tried to poison other people throughout history\nOr you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be poison this way but it's it's actually quite a kind of thing the ... the polio and Mark Anthony Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all were so worried about poisoning they all had foods officers\nLet's say we're a little bit more sophisticated about this\nWe actually have um\nIn America we have the presidential food safety theme and there's a set up\nA security zone where the first family can be without complication in the cockpit of a you know food screeners and people who watch people prepare the food and ah if you get outside\nOf that the White House's own even the air in the White House just over I mean that's quite as oh right right outside of that if you travel\nUm you will they'll go back\nTo having food testers and they've used everything from military prisoners to monkeys the dogs the taste of the fish food\nUm both Presidents Bush Clinton Reagan and even President Obama when they were traveling were using the same thing so this is this is a legitimate threat I'm In Nineteen Ninety three um Turkey's eighth president was poisoned or the Bulgarian embassy when he drink lemonade at a reception\nRight right this is a this is for real thing here um as far as World War two is concerned\nHow they tried to get rid of each other there were forty two attempts on Hitler's life from

California John good morning\nThanks for having me real quick to think\nWind up if you look at a at Roosevelt uh Nineteen forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thing that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may proven to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you know the lip\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this or I'm fascinated with tall and how it got away with all that stuff when Roosevelt died dollar that somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently\nAnd make sure that uh let's see if he was he was calling because uh uh I'm calling it a lot of that and I think it was for the story was that it would require you to ... he won that Roosevelt Web cricket rake them over the cold that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of ...\nI I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I think he did not want him that he wanted to live longer they possibly ...\nThat's just my my take on it All right interesting John ... bad shape you're going to die anyway I like\n[laughter] now as for FDR or he was sixty three and I mentioned you know that was pretty good age for Nineteen forty five today that's fairly young\nUh but just because he he surpassed the average lifespan I don't think it was as low as forty nine back then but I mean George Washington ... ... you know live to be in I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching this stuff and you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Will check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Maher said good morning welcome to coast\nHank rancher thank you for taking my call my plan is\nThe idea that had been ... originally made their money to the slave trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller uh\nStarted out our lighting houses with kerosene that find that combat stumble engine that guy's a gasoline like a byproduct then that can End Days ran that down these guys that I never have no idea how the relatives out well and they\nHave a clue as to how they make their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah\nI Do actually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there were only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote fix the courage to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting\nStuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from Denver\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family are probably it's money so you know just kind of a ... to me elation of wealth over generations compound interest\nUm that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those nice to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well\nYeah I heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging and these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach her name to wants to be as best they can you know for them as far as like the\nI I still get fascinated by stuff somebody will call in and say hey that you know the ... and because it wasn't that long ago really this Seventy

prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the months for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic\nOr talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um that\nYoung student who had down the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that was in control of the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up in a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know the fake medium would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys were very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so\nI had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people they looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAnd the place to talk about it all [noise] Youngstown Warren ... only\nSeventies\nPutting pressure here at home to push harder for an explanation into the death of Washington Post
