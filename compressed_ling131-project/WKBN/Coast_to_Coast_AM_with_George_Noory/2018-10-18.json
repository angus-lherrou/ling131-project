YouTube finally released a statement on the issue saying it wasn't clear at the time what it costs the outage\nBut that about thirty to forty minutes later the website was restored our expert on the Internet Lauren Weinstein where the floor and what do you think happened\nYeah Google isn't going to get into the technical details on the the the outage or actually last that I I guess around an hour and a half a that apparently\nWith a global outage which is pretty that's weird well it it's interesting because\nUm as we know that the the actual video streams the people from YouTube from different locations around the world that that's about all coming from one place but there are centralized system of course so the fact that this was a global out it suggests that there was some kind of access related problem centrally\nCaused us in my own case it was actually the the website itself wouldn't even load properly if I went to YouTube dot com or you normally get all those little thumbnail it would just get the shadows with typically appeared before the video ... that would be it wouldn't actually get the video [noise]\nSo uh it's an interesting kind of situation apparently uh there were

is it the entire Internet it it is a very specialized kind of application\nSo I don't think that's necessarily says anything about the Internet at large but it does kind of make you ... it does remind

inch labor nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is or\nWhat what happens then you would think George is\nWhere does the lending money come from Allen to look for these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the tax payer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this was a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said as making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are\nExempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... practice laws federal um a\nFruit in lending laws [noise] ah and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cup ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at\nEvery interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee\n... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and\nBy the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad and is now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raised their prices but also really string students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt ... there was a story just recently we're\nLosing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder if that's all a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond in shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety billion dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses it's killing entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we come back if you've got a

take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was it Allen that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I um I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for a short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera [noise]\nAh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there with student loans is falling into\nA is a system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is ah what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with the Leslie stall yeah a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy is an outline that people who have a rough credit or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nBy that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got the student loan situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is they'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed\nAnd they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy yours and you know I I make a similar analogy often I'd say you know student loans it's like buying a car where it can you buy it online and say you know look how the great reviews you go and if you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no break you know [laughter]\nUh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so\nIs these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education's ... joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting lower interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYou know it's a it's a real cruel irony and just in general you know there are means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans\nBut still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people who you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and how\nTruly ironic is that is these very people that the landing system was supposed to help uh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece freezing so this has\nJust gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana the get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you\nGeorge got good news for a two man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big signs they throw support the seal day there he looked right at the whole ...\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work where I got on while they when a totally went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time but uh we pretty much went on during the late everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I Love the perfect job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone is with us from 'cause I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too well\nAnd I said well over ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were to forty four thousand dollars just to go it for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up feeling now unless the thousand dollars on the grades little are learning to drive semi I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to the cell and where do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket you know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that\nUh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nIn sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on her um it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many

Cox owner of blind stirred dot com or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blinds we did what many homeowners do and got prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in the industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten\nUm now that could change with bankruptcy and other rights restored but as it is now a these these private loans co signed loans are just toxic and they have they carry with them the potential to destroy a family\nLet's go to Jean in Biloxi, Mississippi Hi Jane

my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the list or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger alone and then get a commission off the top of that or or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nGeorge it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nA job thank you and I hope we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a loan and all for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs but I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you give me do I try to negotiate directly with the the oh he you know I Try to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll take it a faulted you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a very close you know like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic to clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying so I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate\nFind the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you've never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are strong beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they all they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shined\nProblem [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly

same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job there thank you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more okay\nIt's a essentially it is my new documentary that I put out to tell the story all off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO program a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can\nThe entire story of the U.S government for in a relationship with this phenomenon or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation now in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't I is the kind of suffocation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades have to know all the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive\nDefense intelligence agency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and like I say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this the snowy ... or no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment pulls the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this the robot big yellow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff because it's coming from a whole different directions these days\nI think the answer to that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years people have said the\nIs that particularly with ... we have two little information about what's\nGoing on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we almost have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about a case for the deep specialists ah it's a difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to it for than a\nThan a third one but now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this strong guy and then this is a millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this from my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nTold me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight it leads up the Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on the one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the ... said a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon ... did they fight teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nThen literally I went into a recording studio ... you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it to the camera and in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all a together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and then life than\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom me and it's a completely\nNew role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing uh people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um you know I I it was a departure for may so to me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish what they will use at the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly\nI as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and ... and ... you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand we go on to all the platforms\nBut the young people need to watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference where he\nGot together with the to the stars of people\nUm and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has fall down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I Want to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization now like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel is the momentum is waning what do you\n... when when you said the organization um he\n\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had all the way says in the\nSituation's only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nThey would believe that they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back

lot\nSo so I think it's it's a perfectly reasonable moved to say yeah we we should have a space for us but I think some of some of the Komen trip out this has been a little far fetched I mean isn't going to be something from assigned fi movie ... aliens I mean it's it's more about DOMA Nineteen future idle space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention\nYes and he certainly made of course those remarks\nAre very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally thing how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on uh if if we\nFaced some alien threat and and of course people read an awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read by the law into that to\nMy own personal view is that that was much more about just trying to win the Cold War and find crop the Soviet Union which to be fair is exactly the way it pretty much\nPlayed out I'll Try and ... there's been new still talk of disclosure\nAre you you know I I'm\nArguing Steven bass and all the time I don't think there's going to be the kind of disclosure he expects do you think the the things that are happening now governmental ways trying to soften us up for governmental disclosure or do you think it's never going to happen as I\nYeah I I agree with you I don't think that kind of Steve pass it um disclosure with the big the my fellow Americans people the world we are not alone I don't think that\nIn in here they are bringing them yeah\nI'm ... and we've discussed this before one of the big problems of course is is not saying that there extraterrestrial spot if it turns out that we've known about this Seventy years they can be awful lot of questions\nTo answer about that no I I think it's more likely and I don't believe either this is a kind of softening up and a climate ... program but I Do think that through\nThrough the revelations about how you tip them through the classification and release of the British Government UFO your files we all the government say effectively will lick here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nSo classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite want to if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou never know you you never know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today\nI'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you think\nWell he was really a fishing or a genius [laughter] I'd have been a time travel\n[laughter] well I'm not sure about that but I guess there are there are a handful of physicists working on that Ronald mail it comes to mind yep\nBut I think there are some some others you know I I had a job in the ministry that's where I was I think the unsinkable so I I don't really think it\nDid you get involved and remote viewing or anything like that psychic work more that has the ministry you did\nI I mean we had you can't run a UFO program without finding you sell the the focal point for anything\nYou saw that any any one kind of comes to government about and of course we had we had people who said that they were like ... and they wanted to volunteer there to the intelligence community to help out well you know like ...\nSoviet ballistic missile submarines or a mosque by some trade has that sort of thing so we looked at this as a classic low probability high impact probably ... ... but if it does pay off his big wind on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government had three over the years that we know about ... some street can dog ate\nThe ministry of defense going into this briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think ... it's now classified and only ministry defense website actually on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it said that it it wasn't a very good study I have to say\nIt um some of the U.

[noise]\n\n\nAnd backward Nick Pope your questions this hour as well Nick let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings what'd you think could happen it could happen when\nI Know it will be because of course we we get the judge Kavanaugh ... coming up to the mid term but hey well you know I'm\nI'm committee have been a king [laughter]\nDoing and secondly I think that interest has said wait until the white a question of you ate pays more generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative\nAmy ... era I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of the uh science technology and space command tea and and the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the question arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology in space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I I just can't see how you would get it\nOut of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and its terms of reference\nAbout unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay a mystery it's it's a lot so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I supplied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually going into the fight but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good pot gestures to doing what they do to get the word on their\n... absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunate play only got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work as a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens penned again you know if you don't like the way that you you off portrayed on TV sometimes run your own documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles and this this week I had an article published\nIn the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily\nAgreed on line or two\nYeah I absolutely as they will have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee in the house armed services\nCommittee in ... and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it's it's it's staggering but have before articles I've seen about this all four of them a great ... one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line uh I'd love to see a survey or twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety percent online\nI'm sure you're right I mean I'm of course of off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's on the online version but now I guess my my reactions should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies hey Brian\nHey George morning\nHey good to talk to you again hey hey\nAh first of all you had that you'll put up a show about a special report about working last in being at home with you I got I got I've co signed for student loans you know all kinds of stuff so I I got to work [laughter]\nBut anyway make great program may great crew time of your top notch guy but a net what an honor it is to talk to you my my friend you're not my friend but third grade on her\nThank you Brian hey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot at pretty religiously and in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the fifties\nThat they they sign they said they scientifically proved the UFOs didn't exist now you said earlier that the some of the believers in your new book\nOr or movie uh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the labor were people from project we book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you\nWere saying spring will talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was um of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear that they wanted just to get out of the UFO business\nOr at least they want it to the public out and that's another point that we make in in the documentary aliens Pentagon really the one thing of project Blue Book um which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nA ball and a memo\nWhich which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake and on ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that the ... reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long how many years\nWell my goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British Government USAID project in Nineteen Ninety One so uh yeah that's more years ago and I can't mention of the of course I did that for\nMuch of the early nineties and they stayed in the end Modi in different positions until two thousand sake I never lost my interest in in all of\nThem were you interested in UFOs before you were put into the ministry of defense\nAlso told no I not interested didn't know anything about it I was simply is falling to that position um it it was like here's your next posting and I was like yeah boss okay what's the job and boy did it change\nYour life if you remember what was the very first case you looked at the oh my God\n\nWell I think I don't know whether it was one that actually came in\nI mean we go we go to a three hundred reports each year\nI think it was it was actually going through the old filing cabinets pulling out the old files you know dating literally back to the the actually the second World War but I'm I suspect was pulling out the ... forest file you know\nOf course I'd been
