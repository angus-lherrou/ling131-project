with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News media in Russia China basically\nI discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country then why would you take a chance\nAnd say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nThem to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah file I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are being out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorist talk about talk\nAbout this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics and our DNA to in slave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un you know if what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knew something at the time\nBut when you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Ross\nWell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who go snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep I\nMean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some are being\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology\nIn order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps preventing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with them stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October

and it was my uncle had just passed away and he told me he said John ... your car and I wish I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone but still I was ... and ... and so I got it right on our friend of mine and the next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait

hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle ah they're both

so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad

or\nAnd he wasn't supposed to be there was\nI I don't think so I talked to the CNA in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they\nEveryone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone to watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys\nThink 'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full news and I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\nHuh do you know the little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no loans have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nOf Illinois ... what do you think Josh\n[noise] well ... thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being magnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have\nA colder drier environment and I know that certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you drag your socks on the carpet and touch the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating Loomis life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold when when they call it an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible field around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this\nTime of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store you see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife\nYou see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the highest likelihood of experiencing something ghostly spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nJosh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people who've always\nIn a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina uh especially at Ashville when when the leaves are splashed with color\nAnd everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of history of the greatest mystery of the ah last colony and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating Fallon and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited it I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or

all about the supernatural he was with us a couple of months ago with Richard\nTalking about some hunted rock and roll that was a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having\nMe on very background\nHot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\n[noise] well the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I wasn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and all like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or did Halloween cut into your birthday when you're you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday exponential I refer to it as the season of Matt now\n[laughter] I Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how how did you get your interest in World War two\nAfter I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to find another project to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nAre and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural\nSo I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any good stories and and sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I liked it\nDo I like to couple ghost stories with you know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two ah it turned into be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in the world war two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nCreates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on things as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university ... stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of the stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities\nSo there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that um\n[noise] you know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops in ... during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories\nIn and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just want the little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was and you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg we know is that right I'm sure there are other battlefield that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting is it because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um and and they're essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this ... in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma\nOf war ah causes these um almost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some a theorist and also say that you\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one playing to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that\nBecause these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal ah activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so ...\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\n[noise] I think consensus wise I Would say ah Normandy is extremely haunted um\nThere's just doesn't stories\nAre especially in it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists are documenting what happens but the bunkers the fortifications uh seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a\nA father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy peaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunker they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she solve these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately ... uh recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that\nAway from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the\nGuns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what could have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nDespite everything all you want spice okay I Want to get\nGood oldest by

it\nWhat about haunted ships from World war two\nWell I didn't want it just didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside\nWell yeah I'm I'm going to make sure I have those in there so the interesting thing about a ... after World War two if you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that uh the sailor served in that it was a shame to just got old them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of um\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships as living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports\nThey brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor um there's\nA lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the ones they call him shadow ed and Ed's stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing this shadow creature around the the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship based a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ships the USS North Carolina I worked with a uh a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on their\nUh and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah they're the a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved them and have him back here go send all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy ... for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element of uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of of country these tragedies\nJust seemed to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a a\nA interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe that were just so primed um to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spirits linger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew swim we're going to take calls next hour with him stories in costs\nTons of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of euro haunted rock and roll stories those ... those are fantastic too\nI Love them that's one of my favorites [noise]\nThey just keep coming more and more and more they just never stop like you know people like Michael Jackson who passed on now when prince and folks like that have they come back you up to a ... as a ghost\nWell there are definitely good stories about Michael Jackson uh there were a few video anomalies\nWhen a when I Believe his brother I Believe it might have been germane was being interviewed people said they saw Michael Jackson walk behind him there are stories from a neighbor's of a former home owned by Michael Jackson claimed to hear music coming out of it at odd times\nWhen there shouldn't be anybody at home so definitely a\nMichael Jackson ... have been seen\nThere are starting right now a lot more good stories about prince who just died I think\nBack in two thousand sixteen [noise] uh [noise]\nIs a Paisley Park has his recording studio several of the workers there claim to hear people shuffling\nAround to hear voices fans have also blog about how they believe like they've had an encounter with it goes to\nPrint out

supporter and when I heard him sing crash and burn I was like\nThis isn't like the the sad country songs singing crust that was in that I've been listening to for five years it's like this is crazy like what is that if you ever wake up one day and decide that you don't\nPlease let me be the first person to have it\nAnd he takes me I'm a couple of months later and said hey man does you know I think I'm going to go in a different direction and crash and burn all yours\nPoint is that in it was like okay now I\nHow in the world am I going to pull it off um because Chris singing a demo is the most terrifying\nAn al ...\nWeekday mornings in age you Dan rivers [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Matthew swing with us Matthew I'm it off Hitler as sick as he was was also interested in the cult did you come across anything that the dealt with that\n[noise] you know I did and I came away with a a little bit of a different perspective about Hitler and the occult or you know initially I thought that Hitler was a a cult practitioner throughout his life\nBut what I found through my research and this is pretty controversial and I'm sure there'll people have have different ideas and I'd be glad to entertain those thoughts too but it sounds like Hitler's\nA philosophy was influenced by a cult groups like the full society in the real\nSociety very prevalent in a pre World War two Germany in that area but what I think happened was that Hitler was of all things are not in a coal theorists but more of an incredible sociopathic nurse assistant I don't think he could think\nThat there was any type of power a worthy of him I think he thought he was the ultimate power and that the state was the ultimate power\nAnd so what you see later is that a Hitler begins to purge a lot of those so called groups he starts to go after fortune tellers and astrologers so I came away with a little bit of a different opinion\nOn the cold in in Nazi Germany uh likewise I was sort of fascinated that the occult played a much bigger role in my opinion a among uh\nThe side of the allied side so there were\nThe wiccan in England who ah tried to get together to uh spiritually or go after the Nazi regime or they held um meetings and the ... got together with the express purpose of trying to\nTo stop 'em Germany from invading England and likewise uh and I really picked us up from a frequent guest on coast to coast Mitch or with\nUh the allied a new thought ... a movement those a lot of the practice of that group were very involved into trying to use spiritual techniques a cult techniques\nTo stop Hitler from uh from succeeding\nSo those were a different ways that are ... you know when I tried to write a book I'm\nI'm really I Know a lotta people write books because they know a lot I like to learn a lot so I go into a some of these stories with really preconceived notions and then as I delve into it I find twists and turns that that I I Try to bring out uh in in the book\nNow in your stories on haunted rock and roll told me the theme about those\n[noise] well the theme of out hard rock and roll is that I really when I started writing hard rock and roll and again another I listen to our Gary Patterson on your show many times ah\nAnd ah you know I started to investigate and what I thought initially was that rock and roll had this special cult power and maybe people that were into the court were attracted to it\nBut after writing the country book and revisiting rock and roll for more on a rock and roll what a ... a ... I came away with is the thought that\nMusic is really just to consciousness raising toll ah it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also a key part of a lot of\nUm historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open to things like\nHumor about it's talking about it\nI just don't trust the election on five Seventy doubled you baby and search for answers is on the deadliest transportation\nAccident in the U.S an almost a decade twenty people killed in ...
