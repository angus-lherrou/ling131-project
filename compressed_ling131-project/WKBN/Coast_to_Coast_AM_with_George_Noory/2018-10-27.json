I'm just an average person\nBut it has some celebrities talking and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide had the board she 'cause originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with blue you know what I made a color copy ... [noise] and so I Would in a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress\nAnd his son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend\nAnd I sense as a board and she said that she had spoken to him repeatedly and thanked me and she is a very famous she's dead now a convention or if you if\nYou don't you go ahead who was [noise]\nWas she was from the tech Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore\nOh Mary Tyler Moore was on the ... show on her own shows weren't time and more\nNow but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is it's so in other words what I'm saying it's not just the evil you can you can deport all does it you know to channel would you want I think Bob [noise] was\nNaive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you didn't realize\nThey're going to come and they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandfather was it was in one day and then a month later he was in another town another town and then it caught up to them and that's um I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself\nAnd his body was never found no but he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was typed because he never would write in freehand bomb number wrote anything down and he were type it or use stencil\nAnd what did he say what was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the the the stress that he's being haunted he said he made a mistake by making the board\nAnd people were haunted him that he has hurt\nAnd then he he went into it was a Jersey beach town\nAnd walked into the water he said he was

they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you are in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make their own start customized selling them\nBut the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money I there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really

they take it seriously\n[noise] well which is kind of awkward because I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for ... which is an old TV show or on the which was on like channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like um show he did like producing I think mhm\nCurrent affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level like the same image to same exact [noise]\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything you know\nIn the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know not to I ...

write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to really tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest here in the very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she she lives to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars in which she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she's just very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very um [noise]\nA very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with Ted Williams family in ... but I mean I what what\nIs the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on but you know I got to be honest with you

remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life is you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the

J. B. N. [noise]\n\n\n\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAnd they were slowly throwing it out like you know with hair dryers and stuff like that a little bit at a time with the intention of\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard names\nChurch so um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're gonna traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were to find the natural order of things and you got to believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nThat one yet not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired and it was for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive trade sense depressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against\nYou know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight are we to do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the ... thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and\nYou know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind\nDoing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it it it is inevitable that one day a\nArtificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\nYeah you know ... you write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's pretty that writing is on the wall e and\nI mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just\nDoing computations ah but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about or we want supposed about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that's the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is used in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\n... are like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose it you lose a\nYeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising was at the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendships [noise]\nI think

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho has a trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk the spinal injuries and and this to them is dream ... you're just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a call the ... human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable a trend human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms that\nHe can move with it thought so they're they're wired mind\nAnd I was amazed and fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there yeah where you know right ... ... ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella got what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we can come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would revel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we spare\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know and and now and\nAnd the ... group you know I called them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some other stuff soon or using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nQuestion then becomes do you get such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete ...\nAnd I mean then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race so right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same\nYou know all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology\nOf the your opponent you go unconventional\nAnd you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ... you know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to a gorilla her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nUh and his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand if somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden or by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently or who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was\nClaiming one thing he said there was an intruder

like and it was like\nNo they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you're you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the big the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I don't give a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think you you\nWere talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation it talked about in mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine it's\nIs that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in in our them up and are they talking about this period that you're talking where we've achieved and mark\nHello this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nAh and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot of it\nWe don't want to reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's in the form of a big computer server\nOr it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and so beyond ... you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy net running it's like running on\nOn energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the or from saying or from the crush souls\nOf the people it dumps on on you know getting are going to get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right happy I haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know the ... so piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so\nJack Lew that actor was exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them\nSo keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona on coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing the strings artificial intelligence\nUm one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah and if they do we just leave them and we just left them\nOh no Well James is in in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh I enjoy your show but uh [noise] I've been on a machine going on forty five years yes er\nHere and I was a banker degeneration I'd like to know from your guest or would you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a genetically modified pigs I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these primarily\nA there's a lot of great Reese reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or ... it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left

invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this and yet you keep reading reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well bad food and water you know the goal is to get them up to our southern border

haven't come here because the term ...\nWell I think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the

calling about the migration and the rush on our border and\nI Want to know what your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing this basically committing treason and is that the Trump

on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come race in towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us in or were horrible people uh

it's called trumped the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency you know those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a senator orange she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American and your mate is into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base\nThat Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we've got a very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the four to ... a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nWe will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally thinking blame the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that he or she says all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Porter because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response oh\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such a ... well could there answer possible\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shut the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's getting lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nShowing it showing listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the day America is about aspirations\nAnd America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's\nNot only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper\nAll of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never come up\nFrom the sixties seventies eighties
