buying is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you know what you want to half of the women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many\nMany more women come into the c._e._o. positions and they're going to want us yeah\nOh excellent and was absolutely Exxon once and and uh\nSo we're ... we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\n... what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being going right now it's actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different than Gen Y ... that they're going to be just the same\nCyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z\nA but it's what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that again\nI don't care listen it is what it is\nWell listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals or the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just hear about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah it it troubles me it really does\nWe knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean ... unless I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but\nWhen you have a president takes\nOn a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's\nAnd that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think

information in a in a single Wall Street journal and somebody would ever think about an individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't know is\nWhen you talk about the trends and change this is what we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight instead of just talking about something they're screaming at each other because they didn't you get ... they didn't agree with each other and in I've never seen that this bad you\nKnow no I haven't and it it's called diplomacy and I wonder where it's way where it's gone I I I just simply don't know\nYou know people ...

and we won't make all these mistakes [noise]\nIf you think about it I'd rather have a government that runs like a government a diplomatic government or a Republican it's based on a constitution\nNot one that's based on business principles we used to have that\nYeah we used to have that but now we have a government that's essentially run on business principles and it's it seems like there's there's no or the you know we just take it all do we have removed the rules but what we've taken away the the we've taken away the diplomacy that was necessary to be a diplomat\nWill what's going on

biggest demographic blunder and the history of the world with that one child policy\nThey did it for about forty years so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy let now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate for uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't fix it because you you you you can't suddenly um you know people are born babies born is that do\nNot buyers that's for sure\nNo so what what you have is is they're missing and this is a real number I'm a five hundred million people that weren't born five hundred million and a half\nBillion so so ... here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people\nThat make big incomes that have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax you mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers [noise]\nUh and the the ... the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well we'll have cooked himself because they're going to have essentially a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen in how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah ... whenever a country gets in trouble with their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's right and then go to war\nYeah they well they may they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've ever want a war\nI don't know what's going to happen there but but it it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are an economy is not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour the cover of rolling in here for you Kenny let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi you're off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response so two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a waiter or\nI'm not up on that so all of those how patients that have looked in the high I Can't do that\nAs a human being or has a Christian but I think this has a Christian and a woman or white or the other things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh I'm the wife are\nBecause she had nowhere to go in Haiti cash apps and that warrior yes what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually quite a few that he would he run and ... when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm yes with all the work self serving isn't strong enough for what both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man\nBut more importantly it man has had actually a little while still at home I yeah and that little one buddy young wife and crude and catch quite and we had a president at something so fire\nIt can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars and everybody said oh he has a right to a private life if I did that if he did that\nWhen it's over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature that second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than I think that's that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself is that men and women don't have time for now and then\nYou get a deal done we're not going to have an eating to have a meeting to have a meeting and then kept committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy that song if the death when ward diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him out and be happy to know ... is that anyone that with the cross it four times and he had\nHe said he could get back up yet on the horse\nI I I I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and she doesn't care if people call in the race is\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other oh no yeah well I ... it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she yes as I as a man on and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments day not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilets or you're the pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where Lutz not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a ... a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas\nI'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says but I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and the uh I\nDon't know I think what he has done is dignify\nIt the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBut you know yeah I you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you monitor yourself in it than just move on and say you know folks I already said that I'm done with it and ended up like that\nOh [noise]\nAs nice decisions on how does this look clouds gathered subtle to see if\nCan push the cheeses\nAs we ... we would use [noise] we'll have\nYour accurate for

know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nAre in fact I what I see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north and the south [noise] do\nYou know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that could happen but what concerns me as a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nYou can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level\nFertility Michael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher I guess my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state ranking New York state and also seen except become the largest city out raking I filled out here\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the profound

Pittsburgh when accused synagogue massacre shooter Robert Bowers appeared\nAs he was compliant when his attorneys asked that his hand Cosby taken off he said that's okay I can scribble meeting with one hand cut to the other as he had to sign documents\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for serving my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the these things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these\nAll these experiences together into a book and a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but uh to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lotta people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear\nEven that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a\nA a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance to uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rating who's the\nChief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those skeptics so\nThat's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and\nYou know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in his research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast she was out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's gonna spread a lot faster\nBruce olive sold ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience so this this initial experience I had at age four\nKind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in awhile put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control or just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that\nHas been the the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have is you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I Would try and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time\nAnd I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a I got very sick very suddenly I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally ... fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen in the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little map and was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse and my\nMy relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and between the beams and this old farmhouse\nKitchen and ah it I felt like it it it was an end jelly presents it it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and\nMy mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first ... experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and\nAnd and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kinda passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in an endless was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers

situations have you've stumbled into that\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like the continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nOr the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event\nAnd later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific than mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had nobody wants to we didn't know ... yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but ah she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people\nAround the world who have who have a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this that that that people had since that and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of his books I I I Can't remember which one of his books but yeah he does talk about that\nWhat do you think ... the [noise]\nI I I think I've had experience with with telepathy with my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger a ...\nA camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the Oregon Coast and at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a card should look at it and send me the you know tried to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right\nWe would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you\nKnow there was a king or jak face card a very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big foot experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this it was a ... near Oric which is northern California and the redwoods highway there and are driving south\nAnd uh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's\nVery ... and as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but\nIt was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we drove by and it\nHave been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she she said what what are you talking about big for I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there is one here another miles from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about this we are in fact\nThere's been there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh the reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a big chance by stand right on the on the edge of the highway and the dark total dark\nYup uh and they can get shot at or anything she got\nRun over crazy you know whatever or you know the alternative which which you know so that that was my my one and only a a big foot experience\nWhat about the uh

know she was herself but very healthy she you know she died of cancer and she was very healthy looking she was gold and had this golden glove\nAnd uh she came to me and said you know there is a heaven

Dan rivers\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThan welcome back ... with us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description tell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm In our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nSo close to me and he said\nAh ah Bruce it's it's it's OK I'm OK there is nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and\nShe you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there is nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it in that the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was\nKind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now that are often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for\nIt I didn't really have to fight that was that that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it at the college\nAnd I am a tenured professor there and and\nI think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get\nMaybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could've accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical\nIncluding one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks in the or seven weeks in the course into the course um\nAnd uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories and that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories\nAnd it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow

just echoes or um I think they're a reserve what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the two ... where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in ah in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... A M visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent
