afraid in the bedroom there's a man in my closet\nYou know parents are finally starting to listen to their children when they are upset about something and kids they know what's going on there are so innocent they can see spirit that crossed over spirit that haven't crossed over normally kids aren't afraid unless the spirit is mean to them\nLike you learn when you were a kid\n... that's exactly right so and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get or do you know straight and granted my head\nMost of these kids don't camp that something to fall back on now all they had you know

she did\nRealize that when I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative\nThat died and Italian ... everybody's related somehow and so you know I was Graham a special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead the only thing and I was never scary\nTo me I mean the person was just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gas it but he was fun and he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question\nBut would ask the question or the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever asked the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung they did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOn carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person alive person because I never understood I thought they were sick I didn't know what was wrong\nWith that [laughter] did you perfect your skills as you progress or did the did you always happen like that\n[noise] [noise] no I said the older I got the easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so

was all kinds in there\nAnd I just have I learned how to keep it open long enough and it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter terror can do this\nAnd that she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently I think everybody has the ability it's how you develop that oh you use it\nEvery time I've talked to you you've been upbeat about everything you do have you ever been scared to death with something that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty five\nThirty years ago that happened a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face and\nAnd I wouldn't houses if I thought it goes to kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door you had no idea how loud that was when it hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here and then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid\nBecause that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them and I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the light it's still free will\nBut you're gonna leave this health one way or the other\nAnd now that I'm older you know when I was fourteen Twenty one twenty five

me\nTo try to get rid of the double or the demon or whatever it might be exactly\nThat's exactly right and there are people that say their team and I just think they can take care of that more power to him\nYou don't perform exercises and things like that\nI Do not I people have had um possessions where I had done that and I actually stopped doing that because every time I Would do a possession I

I Hope that wouldn't cause problems it uh [noise] uh but that was the question and uh what what do you think I had a little anecdote for you to afterwards\nYou mean if if the the the individual uses the language or the ... yeah\nYeah if I uh you know\nI was angry at five and you know when I when he was I wouldn't use try and try to stay away from who\nRight yeah but I mean could that cost a curse on somebody's life Fifteen Years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energy shopping or something I've noticed that are in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or\nAround people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light but then for red warm you know and\nYou're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy either way either ... direction I mean he was on or off when he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off\nA lot of people wanting to be away from ... that was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey Ronan thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably rather than our has friends come over the person I worked with and\nSaid hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a skin acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe another thirty miles from\nWhere we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling\nAfter I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the slaughter bright and sign up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed seating bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that are in the in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah there are ... to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it\nWas just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA were off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward roads there's like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum\nSo they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk so I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name police\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an outer ring a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yeah and she goes we'd better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead and I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up\nAnd pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we have these dreams Myers about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody into um where they're going to kill you [laughter] I don't think so\nNo I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to um when me over somehow or another 'em like they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had
