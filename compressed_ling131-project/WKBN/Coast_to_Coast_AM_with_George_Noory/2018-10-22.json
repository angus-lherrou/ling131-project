fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series use broaden his uh his Web is net and his uh focus again the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path of pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project a groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies you learned as a police officer\nTo the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist to give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell it may have been focusing on missing for one one for the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so areas with a new work it's an archive of big foot and wild man stories and news reports dating all the way back to the year sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think Dave is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\n[noise] hey George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that we had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh [noise] there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it is yeah I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\n[noise] you know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the seventies\nYears and focused on missing people but when you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like big foot when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it'll say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented in and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man the giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago a when your first year you'd be kept the project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd what kind of got its hooks into you know all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they told the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the heroes\nAnd they found each other later in business and we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave we you have Twenty years as a police officer ... years of investigating an HR\nYou're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially I said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't\nIn Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThose hundred and ten ... tell a story that phenomenal\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big bought Wildman and giants ease Harry noon and night night I mean big but ... air take us

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have Howard while or giant human bone\nAnd that's that really makes you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no familiarity with the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been old Fred so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nThat chocolate with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise]\nUm and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how Fred that decide to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our current news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and the description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but\nAgain if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some explorers wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so\nBut again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church was coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore notes\nThat this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and looked at him I I actually spoke to him large hairy by ... he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or a big foot and it came from the archives with Watergate church butter de saint church and it's in there so\nTo say that these things haven't happened ridiculously\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from September Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild white mass\nLanded in a field releasing a huge here are covered being that was seen briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive a big what people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on or about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a fellow over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of this and that\nHis book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book and people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking with Dave ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archived articles sixteen eighty to Nineteen twenty two\nGreat stuff packed into here we're going to take a short break and come back and sometime in the next hour I'll open up the phone lines you can join the conversation from big what the little feet here taking us into the break with a song from waiting for Columbus [noise]\nAll these years gone it lasts sticky ways to leave your lovers and the title track all reached the U.

W Katie and\n[noise]\n\n\n... you know looking back at your your original book the Hooper project and it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey brat\nA these look like humans faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's the general consensus that a sort of matches what other tribes have stated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to see the find a group that says they're an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson ... film and it's you know if people can argue about all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been to bump but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the beings that that that you're you have drawings up in this and the beings that are described in in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo one I did with ah the gambling film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on\nHas a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSeek and see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect so apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by Ted\nIt's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made in probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine or of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just follows ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's campfire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like ... five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake\nPlaying like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there was a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on pick for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and since the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say\nAnd every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories are these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them um just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there are never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it\nThan fat seems to be a there are\nInstances where in in these accounts where a humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said\nA friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard\nThe human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him are apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and\nKill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're\nNever going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence

caught despite that on film and that quality of a location and segment like they did in the sixties\nHaven't there was something phenomenal about out of that it causes that female big foot stay

J. B. and\n[noise]\nWelcome back Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history there to authors are Sarah ... an acclaimed documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nRight here in New York\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw\nUm I was watching it with my dad was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of the ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I I Hope someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet them the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that's kinda the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd when for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be um an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over two stories\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive flu I get this email from this young filmmakers name Sarah Vladeck well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm being Indianapolis\nThe storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part Lenny theory than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we can stand brothers\nBut we only face mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need the right stuff while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I and then maybe veterans you didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the ... the eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then uh we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and so twenty four ... um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nBut I'll tell you you grab ... my father was at ... he drove a landing a craft from uh the ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah get most of the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned will like the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shift and I'm a small part that a lot of people don't know is\nThat she with the flagship at the battle of now or where your father drove a landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was the case of hitting

Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around Bain on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarines because Japanese submarines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attack increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them there's one account you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food I'll just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young intern by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship a that everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines see\n'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a\nSixteen rap between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any\nWater that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know the second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nOr while the other one poured the water through it into this into his now and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take small for it is that the sea water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of the mountain stream\nAnd what happens with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels first\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was the site all the sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did some quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced finished them off\nYou have a somewhere Hyland who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter\nOr an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nThere was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosions coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but you know he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd you know the army side of things\nWell let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it and he still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw the genuine look into it and they said no there's nothing recorded in that area don't worry about it and so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they had a son who you know the gentleman richer Francis have passed away but it's then carried on a story and you know there he\nActually had diary entries of the time and at the one hand and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he when\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right

of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of drop through the cracks or that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mention there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there was a tenant on the Philippines side who had received a message saying that if\n... if a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and that as a matter of fact had received a fitness report thing as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrivals the combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either\nAnd then you know can be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion at the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it said the Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one ensure a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors just find it in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books or a about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and tried to uh give these uh guys in the water or something they hang on to and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to head back and there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left to airplanes to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to in a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for our ship for el CBP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive in on that with a burden they carry till the end of their life\nYou know it's war time as we said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but or is it an accident that this story was kept all out of the newspapers until BJ day uh and well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the time they do not believe it was an accident so the rat to occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth between the time zone fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not and now the Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not getting Washington did not release it\nAnd tell the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war with over stuff you can imagine huge banner headline on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article you let the Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time I Believe that Washington and the navy specifically did that to
