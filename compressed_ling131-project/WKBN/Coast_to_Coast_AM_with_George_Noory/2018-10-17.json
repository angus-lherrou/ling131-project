remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to try and saturate stash civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War or the ... are they a lot of Mexican started to come over here in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and uh this is around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana along with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a name\nTo create in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny on covering for Madison talks about all this stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax that which I don't know if you heard of that or\nTax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and he said he didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever set but the fact of the matter is is that\nPeople have the smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around the around people are just around people\nWho simply want to get high whether it's through a

and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and I never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the lot it every day the the feeling of a\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I says I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try and he says he says and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some

crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and a and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we

dictated most description and honestly I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo

coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick Perri see with us a rod Serling in his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nMissing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone is black and white it's just it had an aspect of film and walk to them on the war has got to have that black and white uh edgy look to them and that\nThat's what the twilight zone episodes had a in fact there were six twilight zone episode that were done on videotape instead of film\nAnd when you see these videotape episode you see how completely different they look than the rest is still black and white but they do not have that film work field to them that the filmed episodes do and so if you take that up a notch and make it color then forget then you're completely in another universe and you're not for me you're not in the twilight zone anyone\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately yeah what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he he's the one who probably pitched it to the network ...\nAfter that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and\nAnd he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie or they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he was he was so busy with television I he wanted to write a novel he really did but she just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be a rebuke to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who are the director and writer of get out a is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise]\nYou know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wasn't around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was and a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to\nWell he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a surgical credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of\nYou know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a heat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift [laughter] she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know they only visitations and UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know\nIt is and and the show was so yeah as you said they're so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction\nAnd fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so um you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season\nA episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know we live as youth and go back to a easier less stressful life\nWas on the will of eating or it's just like really as kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to its distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme for Serling was this idea of going\nBack to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still note to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know the that's the [laughter] ever [laughter]\nAnd then just so many good Leo what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a ever Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of dragged to Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nAnd it drove him crazy after a while then ... exactly right yeah for\nThe next day with us we're going to come back and take phone calls next our folks so if you want to chat about rod Serling talk about your favorite episode or

playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to see what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's called the invaders\nAnd and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery or because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like you know that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to be you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what that is what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode but it was finally released years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all an hour long as opposed to the half hour I'll rarely yeah okay yeah\nAnd miniature was one of the hour long episodes and it it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has a horrible horrible incident a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead yeah Hi\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape is\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really light that my second question would be a doubt\nThose valleys in the news radio five Seventy eighty and\n[noise]\nWe

soldier during World War two and which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say

thought he could alter that event\nOf course\nBut a man I don't know it'd be hard to say which me my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and that call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest get get rid of all times the guy was all a shrine\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus years it was a man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went and a back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags and all of a sudden became full of gifts instead of a you know and pecans\nAnd he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found car well given these gifts out at this a place like a John three sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes and goes where did you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nTo the police station and the department store owner came in nursing care there it is there is the merchandise oh well you're the blah blah blah you know\nAnd the guy's name was Mr ... department store owner right and and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but it can it right\nThere so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out of that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he raced in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it\nTo Mr gundy [laughter] you know said merry Christmas and both of them got pre pre toasted on the wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer and ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you

was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut\nAnd ended up in the antique business after a

stuff and they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do a little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money
