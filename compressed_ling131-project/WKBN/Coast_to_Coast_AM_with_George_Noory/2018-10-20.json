P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security\nAdviser John Bolton is reportedly approaching the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the eye and ask for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that\nWe've tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe powerful renewal of a twenty two new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we are going to renew it and that should be a a a really a shot across the bow of Moscow ... concern to solve it\nYou know that is cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War 'cause the Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviet from the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began is ...\nThey're just ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nSoldiers thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the north\nKorean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated\nSome might suggest that the United states was poking the bear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest as perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a\nFormer Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin the new president after Gorbachev stepped down\nCame to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result as you know really fueled\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in the fence ministers just met for teams time over the top\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will pick this up on the other side

satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're shooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not\nNot just the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information a appears to be in bed with the government of People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on uses the cloud\nEt cetera um that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising\nChinese economic power and they want to be part of a the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these fronts\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because uh the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his do Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that ah the cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called ... and the the desert which uh he was expecting all these uh donors and investors to come over and pat him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology you they're totally dependent upon our arms that of course\nNow they could go to the Chinese and Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nAh ... how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with an of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west we're not all excited about uh but the reality is that um [noise]\nYou know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is a you know my friend or something like that that the idea being\nThat we we

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos that flew over um you know the\nContested area and the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for the jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of at a sea but these confrontations are on the increase uh we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is\nCalled for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did a in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we kill a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any and times scenario\nOr is it is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the Gaga mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a six to be the collie and\nTo establish a cow fat\nAnd his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but you\nKnow the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a aired on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has\nA and he consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so\nThese are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together\nUh and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our lives\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria\nHoping to kind of look their chops and and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know that's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take\nAll those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait um air to one is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds\nSurface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or the even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the ... from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to Iran\nAnd on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants\nTo alternately well it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO a sensibly used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our a patriots and other fat to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why there's a\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow up from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia as well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert

Bush draw Iraq Iran North Korea back the legal now you're ... you're evil but we are the ones perpetrate evil around the world where the weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\nOr or or ... did not do one you're going to give people year we're still lives there and that he did for work through or wrong or\n[noise] yeah well I sort of question in their Richard it it is it is perspective\nYou know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they kill millions a hundred mile and China where they killed millions\nA and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars\nUm the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances in the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and\nDid it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interests and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of the beholder is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I look at their history and look what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization which you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated and ...\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that we do\nBad things but the rest of the world you know I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um and yet you know it's\nAlways wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid as Richard pointed out of being arrested him pulled out of bed and shot him had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nYou know the likes of the

I don't happen to believe that that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example or to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and please remember we do have free will and\nAre times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise] then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave\n'em oh I I I understand that when when the child is young there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ...\nCircumstances yes if this is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negatives of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves\nAnd they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abuse of they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guys in angels that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in God's\nAlright Joe thank you for that

McDonald's why as you have to report on five Seventy W Katie and\nWe're back on the ... by McDonalds or McDonald's on Lebanon joined again by president ... very special night honoring and celebrating the twenty fifth anniversary of the Nineteen Ninety three national championship team many of those players returning something stand out do specific about that team\nYou know it's funny you mentioned McDonalds that season I think was when they had to make ribs sandwich and I remember was tradition we would always go over on Thursdays and have a ... across the street but when you were talking about McDonald's there I I miss the old make rib anyway that's off topic\nYou know that team was really focus from the moment we lost the Ninety two national championship game and we were sitting there trying to get out of Huntington and we just kept hearing those horns blowing\nAnd blowing you know that was obviously a tough game in Ninety to where we were way down then we were tied and then we lost you know they talked about the horns of Huntington from the time they were in the airport going home that they want it to go back to Huntington\nAnd they wanted to hear the horns being blown by the Youngstown State fans and not the Marshall fans or anyone else so they were a focus group they got better as the year went on they were physical\nHard running off into football team and they weren't good defensive football team obviously when you had a kicker like Jeff Wilkins in that year he kicked in punted which I'm not sure he had done leading up to that doing both so it was a pretty complete team but what was really good about um they were focused\nThe championship game you mentioned against Marshall has Iraq elect we jumped on him early with some big run play store now Clark Tim run Smith got ahead of them and then the great goal line Stanley that seems like yesterday how how vivid is that memory do you that was terrific\nYou know it really was a our defense played lights out that whole game and I told people often after that game Marshall could have played six or seven quarters and nuts scored on our guys because they were not going to let 'em in the end zone you know they scored five points but a field goal and the safety I don't even know how I don't even remember how the safety happened\nWe might have made a mistake but they scored five points and they weren't going to get in our end zone\nAnd that goal line stand was just a reflection of their tenacity they didn't care if you had the ball and the one inch line you are not getting in there and zone and it's so good to have so many of them back here this weekend and hear their stories and\nYou know they get better as years go on I mean they could have been to New York giants listening to all of them at our reunion a you know just a special group of guys that are very close\nVery tough they were good ones\nRight in the middle of that success former athletic director Joe ... who passed away this week the man who hired you know Joe was so much more than an athletic director and we grew up in Youngstown he was such a vibrant part of the community and I know your relationship with them with special you two are really close weren't you\nKnow no doubt that I just did a national seminar as a president and the topic was what the chancellor pit and the president Robert Morris and we're over in Pittsburgh and there were four or five hundred athletic director was there and one of the questions on the panel they posed to me is what do you look for in an athletic director\nAs a president of university all I could think about was what my athletic director did for me and I said you know I've never really thought about it because we've got an athletic director I haven't had to worry about looking for an athletic director but as I think back to what Joe mill Missouri\nDid for me is he made it crystal clear how I could grow as the head coach in what needed to be done and he mentored me\nI was thirty three years old when I came here I didn't even know what I didn't know I reflect back on 'em all those opportunities to sit and learn from them and talk with them and maybe even be scolded by him\nAll from the context of he loved his city he loved his University He obviously love the game of football and and believe that the game of football could mean a great deal so everyone around\nYou were ... by Joe I think maybe felt left out I mean his legacy will continue for many years to come\nJust spent all that he's done here and in\nThis community you agree on that he left the community after he went to the service and coached in high school whilst and in Lima and then went to Heidelberg colleges alma mater to coach and then high room and so he was away from the community but he always wanted to be back here and he came back in Nineteen\nEighty three I think it was shortly after tough times at our region some people were leaving the community and he was coming back\nAnd all he wanted to do was for this community to be you know vibrant and believe in itself and know that meant so much to them and of course you can't have a discussion about Joe mountains or without mentioning the Youngstown these golden bears because as much as he loved why issue he loved the golden bears is much\nThey're doing well the seasonal football thanks for your time we'll talk to you next week President Trump is Bob back with more of highlights after this halftime brought to buy McDonald's on the home of the pain was five Seventy WKBD morning sound by\nDonald why you have some\nFive ...\n[laughter]\nWell the coyotes have been anything but widely\nCoyotes coyotes ...\nI don't know Kevin said back in the studio with you for your wife Super Bowl halftime highlights brought to you buy insurance agent Rocco nor the with all state why is she would win the tossed and they would choose to kick off but it'd be puzzling through a lot of us because it was extremely windy they decided to kick into the wind to start this game\nBut early on that would prove to pay off South Dakota would bumble the ball on their first drive of the game and why she would recover that fumble with great field position for voters\nGamble laugh side good hole forty out across the board of the ball came loose why issue has the football and it is a bubble is new was not down at about seven yards so a team that has not created many turnovers this year comes up with a turnover early and why is she will start their first drive on the thirty six yard line of South Dakota\nWouldn't take long for why should capitalize on that Kevin caster would run again for a seven yard touchdown\nOrder Madame voting towards the football takes the football isn't all that and walks into the end zone touchdown young they never had a pastor\nIran's come at heart now they have the Baltimore team are a lot of white issue and some of the whole\nThey'll run the football good run down to the five

yard gain that may be a first to go with the floor and he carries it offender and so why is you got to turn over in the first quarter early ... got sects they get a turnover early in the third quarter and it results in a touchdown it's now twenty two to six just about a minute into the second half\nIs feel bad for the past ... at least what we got the turnover we had to work a little bit ... thirty five fifty yards when you give it to him on a five six yard line so hard that the best plan for a shutout given them six seven points like that that's a\nTough one base the law puts it up and threw so
