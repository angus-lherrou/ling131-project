millions of lives we've changed and that'll happen years before other snoring companies shut up on the scene the quiet really started a revolution high were Dan and Trina as the founders of CSI quiet people often ask what sets us apart from the competition it's easy knowing was our problem and we know what now\nAnd she was there for me and ah she did everything she could to support me so I wanted to pull my resource do everything to support her and so that's why\nOn the fourth of July I came into the office and I put together a go from me page for her and if you've been to the Facebook page you see the Janine is there and I tell the story as to why and how we came to this and\nThe general support that has already been pouring in for Janine is amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful engineered even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all of the support\nAnd ah we do have a goal but we're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things and check that she can use to get better quickly\nUm and and what we're doing is we're we're ... we're literally having to plan\n... kind of in a two month away or how to get around all the things that we need to do financially to get out of the situation we're in it and we're still of course paying on some of my\nMedical bills from my cancer film

can help contribute to helping my wife\nAnd Liam too you know we keep the family together and and that way we can we can still\nYou know\nWell to provide help\nTo the family and it's hard to ask

everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me\nAh you know one of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Einstein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you can theoretically explain or\nBringing about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today things to tomorrow's bad lunch\nThat's the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach ache does that make any sense I don't like explaining\nIt that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as\nFor example you're in a bar or somewhere like a like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman\nComes up to him and says I Want to marry you and they want to marry you on this date so you set a date\nWhen the marriage is going to happen right you set a date for that and uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair is shave your beard and you get yourself a suit and tie and I want a house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm gonna marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know what's gonna happen\nYou just do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so they passed after you you know after president goes away and continue using continues so finally you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal\nOkay so you're you're preparing for something that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way\nWhich is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not it's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what effect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grasp although there's\nA pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada that actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measure which made to a\nParticle could go back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much and we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're in this comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him long time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about\nAnd we're talking about the blurry cloud in it and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be try to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless why balls sitting by balls in every pocket okay we can have we can face forward okay well you see everything in front of us right at our feet\nBut behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind it that we don't even if we take a look back\nWell she what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things that are happening that we don't understand\nWhy we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about and maybe 's okay this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe he's in what he is\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so\nHave you can prevent me just a minute\nMisrepresent sees me these these clouds\nDemocrats have a shot and take that back\nIn writing in\nWas glad

thirty seven hundred\nRetro causality has always been one of my topic favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the past or vice versa\nAnd I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like a that there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past and quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean when you're in the realm of fringe analytics\nI like saying that it's better conspiracy theory we should start using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea rather than say you're a conspiracy theorist you're fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal ...\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics it being a fringe a analyst\nThere's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nGame show when I played that audio just now\nThe broadcast demand on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five it could have made a lucky guess right but I'm a sucker for time travel would prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads that take you to what it's called the further beyond\nThe modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time\nAs it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise force structure the future in some way\n\nHe was proposed that to what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were\nBeing prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies we see it in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass\nWhat would you like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attacks being predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen and we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow\nPredict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was a bit of a convention one time\nIt was a convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting next I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's a science fiction has never gotten it right and I says I beg to differ ... you write it you're right science or I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ... for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation of math but it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the\nFantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time\nAnd change the course of history\nHideous terrifyingly tantalize it's simply just not thought to be possible\nBut what if it is\nAnd what ... what

question would be in regard to that first but he played mhm like\nDoes that leave their side\nDoes it have to be scientifically ... verified as just a production of the future's all it is no\nNineteen forty five I mean it's just it was from a pax TV they said it was made in England in Nineteen forty five post World war two and it's just somebody predict future having team forty a Nineteen forty five a hundred years in the future twenty forty five\nAnd that's something that you found on the Internet\nIt's somebody was produced it was something that was a released by a pax TV ah bingo and that was a prediction given ... an ounce or on the radio in Nineteen forty five\n... okay\nAnd I mean I mean it was ... it was kind of address but not really all that accurate right\nWell right\nAnd what ... what do you what's the problem you have with it\nJust because I mean anybody could make\nThat's right anybody could make the production of if this was made in Nineteen lives if this was made in Nineteen ... sixty five and it it was still buy\nA month ago\nWell it did it they say was Nineteen forty five so I mean if it's Nineteen forty five and they say it's Nineteen forty five and a group it's called the banks TV and they said they had that from Nineteen forty five I mean I I Can't really get something Arthur C Clark made in Nineteen sixty four they basically said the same thing with this set\nI I read Nineteen eighty four I\nWrite well okay so Nineteen eighty four was made what in the Nineteen twenties and Orwell they're much predicted the future did he not\nWrite write questioning the soundbite that you played if it was late last month right\nWell okay let me just tell you this it was released by a company called apex TV\nSaying that it was an unknown radio broadcast from Nineteen forty five a man was on the radio basically predicting the future and that's all it is I mean you can quiet and I do that of course you can anybody can I don't understand what your problem is\nMy problem is I don't think that the clip you played was originally from Nineteen forty five okay and when do you think it was from I when do I think it's probably\nYeah when you when you think that was paid I mean I I don't understand what you don't know what the problem is with this I ... I'm really wondering what the problem\nLike somebody made it look like this person from Nineteen forty five was saying that but it was really made last week\nOkay so how much how much of that thing that he how much of that recording was that guy accurate about\nWell I Know that's\nNo no I'm asking not very much of it was not all I mean what he said that uh there'd be a lot of entertainment that wouldn't be owned by a lot of companies that's not true we have\nWe have companies that own a lot of our entertainment there are independent or things that he's half right about he didn't get it all have a lot a lot of that production stuff wasn't All right he didn't get a get it All right [noise] yeah it was late again and again I Want you to review it again and realize that [noise]\nWildly golf when he got some of it right he didn't get all of it right you didn't\nKnow it it's not what he said it I Wish things the validity\nOf [noise]\nOkay All right well your question but let any of it but I don't understand why it's so important [noise] I mean if if they said it was Nineteen forty five and find them you question the validity of it but it's like this guy really I mean when you think about it\nHe said it might not all of it was true then he said I mean we didn't really wants to know what he had to say that\nKind of the point is they [noise] uh hope is something that looks kind of real but right and who benefits from it so\nI think it's like people who benefits from the hopes mark here longer fear there was nothing fear ... broadcast [noise] nothing [noise]\nFamous ... war the

there was an audio file but I played last hour and it was an audio files that comes from a picks TV okay a apex TV claims that this radio filed and play your comes from Nineteen forty five\nAnd I played it in some guy called last Saturday says oh it's a hoax and I'm thinking well okay if it's a hoax and who benefits from it that's what I Want to know who benefits from a hoax if this was a hoax\nIt just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making some predictions is all it is and so I don't know why this guy was just so hung up on the idea of the things I thought it was a hoax but what I Want to do is want to play you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to it so I'm going to play this for you again\nAnd ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guy said oh this this is the this is the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy says like I said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we go\nOut and gentlemen welcome back in the program\nToday we'll talk about a rather serious topic for the future hold today we're going to make some protections maybe someday my back on such protections but yeah I Do know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now\nOn the twenty forty five it is to have their own mind and the state of the world\nIn one hundred years sounds we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the last one hundred and he is just one hundred years ago\nAnd the year ... fine the concept of self power frying machine seemed as they can is an identity evidence to many that's great and dust colonel and revenues\nGo out and seeing all changed in the fall came to mind as we go over our protections for the next one hundred years one hundred years of high put it that men will have stepped foot in front of the celestial bodies such as the moon\nAnd the ... one hundred yes I've heard is that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI predict that in one hundred years cause one no longer be constrained for the crown and we'll have the ability to fight and the average well and\nThe energy that powers the cost will come from the sun and one hundred years at the television and says he'll get increasingly smaller I predict the television and sent to the point that they can sit on our\n... five things and\nThen walk that yes there will be filmed cameras at every street corner there won't be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedoms running increasingly vanish wheeler trade our freedom a safety we want to allow our rights to remedy it because they all thought his tell us and we'll keep our\nChildren are safe now remember these are protections north say maybe some of the future man we're back on a good day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if there are predictions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revelation of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and when they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not\nThere are things that shape the past future shaping the past time travel is a fantastical concept in most would consider the stuff of science fiction and\nYet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history yeah\nI don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know\nBut um it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um there are those who\nBefore us have had insight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do you know through science fiction that time travel is possible in his happen from time to time or time after time or or timing for an item and and that's ... as you\nMay know like I said I I in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nJules Verne and Thomas Edison at his tower apartment to start a secret society of optimists plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this

G. wells we talked about how he in Jules Verne according to the movie Matt and that several other people have been a wartime Walt Disney\nWas a member Ray Bradbury was a member of Nikola Tesla was a member a Thomas Edison was a member\nAnd all these guys had connections the H. G. wells Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison they all had connections in some way throughout history but Nikola Tesla he\nWas considered one of the most innovative and mysterious band whoever lip\nAnd test those inventions went far beyond electricity he may groundbreaking discoveries such as wireless radio communications turbine engines and helicopters although da Vinci came up with the idea at first\nI'm just thought it was also the inventor of fluorescent and neon lights torpedoes and the X ray among other innovations but by the time of his death Tesla nearly well he had nearly seven hundred worldwide patents\nHow few days after Tesla died on January eight Nineteen forty three\nHis possessions were seized by officials from the amazingly name government office of alien property\n\nThree weeks after that all of tests listings and documents were given a thorough examination by a group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump\nJohn gene Trump was the uncle of president Donald J Trump\nTrump's on goal\nWas by all accounts are very accomplished and intelligent man an MIT professor of engineering he helped design X ray machines for cancer patients and did radar research work for the army during World War two\nJohn gene Trump's analysis of tests those papers concluded that quote\nTesla's thoughts in efforts during at least the past Fifteen Years we're primarily a speculative philosophical and somewhat promotional character but quote did not include new sound working with principals or methods for realizing such result\nA lot of people that are fans of Nikola Tesla would disagree with what John Gee Trump said about Tesla\nDonald Trump on the other hand what's referred to as uncle John ah as his intelligence he said uh\nThat his intelligence sort of a voucher for his own genetic in historical pedigree saying well you know I'm a brilliant mind just like my uncle John was a brilliant mind in fact Trump said in one interview according to New York or New Yorker magazine he said my uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was even nuclear\nThat's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six after the atomic age was already upon is right that would be a timeline friendly right there\nWell Donald Trump also recalled uh the times how his uncle would tell him many years ago about the power of weapons some day so that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "09"}
