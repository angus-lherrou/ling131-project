steps where I was in Washington DC I mean now we're we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most\nSo for Washington DC is walking that's the ... part it's like um you know I was thinking you could drive to the White House you drive to wash pneumonia we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over to the south side of the White House\n\nAnd we were there when the angle of

that has a\nI don't know Halloween is sending mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October\nInstead of the thirty first has to be the last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people to do that people are saying that you know don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\n\nAnd Halloween of course of the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those the day of the same day of the dead and so it's kind of like a tradition that the night before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nOnly the spirit world but also some of the darker genesis or the spirit world we we um we make Jack o' lanterns to ward off evil spirits but of evil spirits you know they pass over our house as we do it we're supposed to do that is what trick or treaters it's supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent ... and it seemed to you know\nWe're living in times were where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nI mean this year in particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devil is aspects of holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached their\nTime in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ or\nThe bits that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ and certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of loose tyrannical figure this this anti ... we're told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible\nWatch the signs and they may warned of a coming of the end days watch the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ the coming of the of the apostrophe\nOr many men fall to the to the ills of evil and scripture and like ... commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\nWho is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the Irish have there\nBeen rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this got my bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or\nRevelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because\nIn a secular world and we're we are in in you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for for Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore\nWe can say the devil is in them the devil's in them any money mow the devil's in you the devil is this group the devil is that drove the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know this the devil is everywhere and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist that is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you gotta figure the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical over Jersey engine ritual as world events are not simply circumstantial\n\nBut they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs and agents symbolism\nSecret suicidal a cold is a mineral magic and that affects us and he it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me well you talked about this all the time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't which there and I know that\nCausal engineering and ritual magic affects everyone regardless of religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um\n[noise] they ah they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOur ugly they're using you know new waves used biblical symbolism and they use it to exercise absolute dictatorial control [noise] over the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nAnd they play on your beliefs and manipulate you and if you if you're the have you heard the ah the media lately they've been strategically changing [noise] what globalization means saying that well if you're saying that [noise] you know you're against global if that makes you an anti\nSemite well no it does not [noise]\nSay that you're not for global as a means you're not for a world order that is going to be led by a belief system certainly\nHas been part of privacy for a long time [noise]\nAnd so tonight for a little deeper is if we're talking about the anti Christ you're talking about the empire of the darkness the dark wave approaching\nThe dark tsunami demons that we've been warned about [noise]\nBe prepared because we will be feeling the impact of this you know I mean [noise]\nI'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nDan rivers weekday mornings they date news radio five Seventy ...
