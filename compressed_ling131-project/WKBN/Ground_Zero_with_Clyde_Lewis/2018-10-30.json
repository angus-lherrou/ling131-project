soccer's there were unleashed by the Collins elite\nNow what's interesting is this program that I'm doing tonight is is been a long time coming because I've been wanting so badly to hear from Nick Redfern on this subject because honestly because of the fact that he wrote a book about it\nAnd um I uh I heard about it I I Can't remember who told me first about the book and a and what and what it was it's called final events and ah I read some of it was really intrigued by the ... elite and whether or not new or any ties the vampires are we're ... or anything like that so\nI decided tonight it'd be great to have big Redfern on the program to talk about this and so Nick Redfern of course\nWorks fulltime as a writer lecture and journalists he writes about a wide range of unsolved mysteries big foot UFOs Loch Ness monster encounters you've seen him on all of the shows are from ancient aliens to a lot of other special ... and I've even appeared on some of the specials he's been on\nSo

like I said you know ... there's been a long time coming because I Know you've been very busy and ah I remember back when final events ah came out I I was turned on to the Collins elite for the call ins group and the family goes all the way back to the engine druids and or\nThe um the the meeting you had with rabies Shay and how that all came about can you give us a little bit of a background of of what the ... the leader about and and why does the secret families secret society are so uh are are tied to perhaps the vampire legend that we're with legend\nAbout that [laughter]\nI I actually don't know what to call his family is that\nThe Collins elite\nCollins family I Know that\nOh you never heard of the calling Sally you've heard of the columns lead right\nWell yeah relatives that which are any links with ... Wilson\nOh you haven't you heard of aliens right\nWhat's that\nYou've heard the ... were the ones that are ... are are ... you you're meeting with rabies Shay remembering your book you talked to ... and he was with new funding in Nebraska and he says something the fact that perhaps the aliens that have been released that or a mutilated cattle are probably tied to the columns elite\nWell I mean well yeah but not in a ritual they stick by or anything like that\nOr how were they tied up with the college late tight\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and rabies Shay\nWell basically what it was back in two thousand is seven I was\nFor a new idea for a book and I thought about doing water on the far east UFOs ... case in England and say ha and the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books on the subjects already but it was interesting threads late suggesting\nThat ain't my pain like\nAlmost like an M ... things sort of testing new technologies on the on the militia personnel on the base rather than it really is a lot of this and he said that ...\nUm it was I'm falling brass getting a direct ... and also appraised so he had you know it's sort of unique background when you get to you and ate background is one of the founding\nDirector and the other one is a priest\nAnd I spoke to right just as a seven and he said yeah you know we have a ... day and age there may feel like if I have to do some stuff\nWhat about in in a book on age but when they get on the phone and he said well listen even more interesting story you might be interested in in so intrigued about and which I'll make a better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government to the departments of defense who told him that the rental ... case\nWas basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of a program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle\nOf the UFO phenomena and being demonic rather than actual terrestrial than bay and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives of this particular group\nUm and that for a number of decades faint quiet lay and carefully\nInvestigating and the whole issue of the UFO phenomenon and trying to put threats together um to\nFace or at least um to confess I'm the idea that this was demonic you want to say I confess I'm\nFed minds were pretty much made up they would paper open minded they were absolutely sure that's what rights\nSee I was I was under the impression that were re was saying oh they were saying they were trying to tie the aliens to um uh the demons or the demonic demonic personalities again these were they classify them as human entities right in my ... year old\nOf having an al [noise] um so you know in that sense\nYou know you can you can just look at different cultures and countries and\nRealize that you know that there are belief systems life is all around the world um but for the call insulate\nThe belief system was not a belief system it\nWas an absolute fact and um and that's one of the things I pointed out in the book was about um you\nKnow they they they didn't really ... the phenomena that day today ... guy today to budge information that didn't sit well in that scenario they ignored things that dates Satan that scenario they embraced it yeah it's all about the elite the best way to go batty right\nIt is not about what you report what you exclude too and that's another thing to be important about
