of course November set aside for the sacred November first set aside for the sacred in a lot of people forget that and even though we see a lot of schools that a lot of you know that kind of ornate\nA

Thursday BP I\nFelt what\nAre you going to uh to me\nSeemed like it attack by in Sochi\nUm so uh I was on the year when it happened in um\n\nIt was terrifying and I and I uh I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI feel a little sick to my stomach because it was like a something was uh something surrounding me and I could not break away from it and I started crying I was on the air when it happened\nBut I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact that I was scared I mean I knew that something was going on and it was like who was uncomfortable with the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife\n\nBecause I was in California and I was on the air and uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um\nYou don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\n\nMy mother and her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me before she passed away my father said goodbye to me twenty minutes before he passed away\nOn the phone\nHe was in good spirits are just there was told that he'd have to have um his tube removed and if the two was going to be removed he died and he didn't want to be resuscitated and so he passed away\nAnd uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where after a loved one has passed away they have a contact somehow in a dream or they seem in a crowd or some even have claimed to you know gotten a phone call\nAnd a lot of people of course you know they say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the goodbyes from my my parents before they passed that some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes and so sometimes I'm sure\nAnd they say sixty percent of the time this happens is that most people\nYou know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away that come to him in a dream or they appear to them in a room\nWhere you see him in a crowd or you know something indicates that there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are no such things as goes well I I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean goes shore spirit mnemonic communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible\nOr I remember Shakespeare utilize go a lot in his place\n\nAnd you all back to uh go back to a Victorian England and it was fashionable then in many circles to conduct surveillance is\nUm and they had ... boards back then I mean you go all the way back then they had something similar to read you a three legged tables candles\nA table tapping all those things they were used to try and contact the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a um he's tried to create a mechanism we could use ... could contact the dad in what happened was instead of contacting the dead he he he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is is that we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice\nPatsy Cline like it goes you listen to her on a record and she's singing crazy\nIt's like you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson are both gone but yeah we're hearing them on records they're like goes\nGoes on phonograph dose recorded for posterity something that Edison had done rather than communicating with dead we are able to keep the dead in a bottle we can play them listen to them or talk to them in\nThat way and then of course there are those who say that they preserved a lot of what the dead thinking a lot of what the dead possessed by writing pages and pages\nOf what can be called automatic writing I mean the psychics hands allegedly guide the goes to convey these lengthy handwritten messages and sit since that time since the time of all the you know the communications\nYou know go seem to have lost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice for them we have to use a ... electronic voices and\nSo the spirits can be channeled through mediums or they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone and I always had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut see a lot of the time when you're dealing with the spirit will get this big nebulous information and always leads to interpret it moment where the so called experience or the medium or whatever is given a word or science which is knocking or tapping that indicate that something from the serial round\nWhich is to make some sort of contact now horror films they began to reflect the public's believe I'm concerned the contacting of a dead could not only be the gateway to a more simple ... but invites possession by evil spirits\nYou remember The Exorcist I was actually watching the Internet on the Internet to look at the some of the scary moments in people's lives and they always talking about The Exorcist I mean talk about Reagan McNeil the little girl um she was first contacted through a seemingly innocent encounter with ...\nAnd the end of the she thought she was communicating with and who were mother chalked up to us an imaginary friend called himself captain howdy\nBut later we reveal that he's the demon so so or the demon ... and what's interesting is that\nThe demon the zoos also kept in how to
