and\nAll kinds of cool things but yeah I I don't know if they cover though that Reagan was the president they told us be ready for extraterrestrials because if we ever find ourselves in a situation where the entire world's at odds with one another there will always be that alien threat\nThat would unite us and that's and that's the thing is that so we're we're needing now I think we need that alien threat that Reagan talked about um and even ah what was it a Jimmy Kimmel Bill Clinton said the same thing but\nYou know you said like he's a David alien thing or something\nTo bring us together and ah you know that that's a long haul the president's talking about alien threats that you know it's so easy thing really to search for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system\nI'm\nIn addition to the incredible distances involved and the fact that uh\nWe really only have indirect methods at our disposal to look for us to trust your life and we have people who say they look up and they see the stars and they they see the the flashing lights in the sky or they see UFOs during the daytime which by the way there seems to be this inordinate amount of UFOs sightings there was actually a signing on the east coast\nI'm from ... in the Carolinas before the earthquake and not the before the before hurricane Michael hit to the Gulf or apparently it's going to get into the the the Carolinas Carolina's having some really harsh weather since um\nSince Florence and and so now Michael May give them a little taste to some more water and more more rain but that doesn't mean that after the hurricanes they didn't see UFOs and apparently I I someone sent me footage\nI'm from ah Myrtle Beach actually someone saying that a UFO oversight over Myrtle Beach and they said was this with a black he was talking about\nAnd um I really in Cedar you up for myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see the UFO I saw whites but I don't know\nThat we could call that something that's outer space but you know I guess if the person you know when they saw heard the black to show said well you know you hear the UFO it's supposed to be seen that I was what Carol David Davis was saying\nIt would be a UFO that would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time\nSo I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know it's like I told somebody that's it you're sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right you know the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know in and let you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like I said a lot of ... indirect methods to contact or at least try to find\nA signs of intelligent life ... I mean there is also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for and I think you know\nWhile we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to the researchers and writers scientists are going to we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological life they're arguing over small celled organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or\nYou know other um ice planets are icy moons like hop in Star Wars if intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien well how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology to communicate\nI'm probably not and while people say well they shouldn't be advances left in our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of smart or\nIntellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart\nAnd that that was one of the problems I had when I was learning a foreign language and uh you know I was a young kid and I was like you know I was learning a language but I forgot but you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpret that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can ... they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smart or whether or not being an underwear model major stupid and they were comparing Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no money from stoop and they wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages they're really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy when producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks Mandarin Chinese I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and Mandarin will be the language in big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know border things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that sets important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing you know communicating with daily and so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were you in language of the of of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic I'm a you know\nMade up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up or you can still be going on in Esperanto but ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of\nCommunicating and so this seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proved aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Saturday and Medi course the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and many messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nThese groups are don't care if ... sign on the White House they want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm\nI'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider okay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about few nights ago\nRegard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing what\nWhere does this out they're keeping your mind open looking for extraterrestrials in space or looking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um\nThere was a a huge media or I guess the crash in a place called ...

control of some of these techno signatures of the human ear it's picked up on the signal that they say maybe ... ... this was creepy okay\nThere are indications I don't want to panic you but there are indications that the aliens have been sending signals\nAnd only certain people have picked up on them because they're so faint or they they're they're they're buried in the noise of the cities and sometimes when you went in the mountains or the desert you can hear the signals being sent\nAnd some people are far more acute ... and they're able to hear these sounds and their pulse things down\nOkay um\nAnd this is where it gets weird because it makes you wonder if the aliens have been sending a some sort of a sonic found you know like those horns those angel horns we've been hearing\nWell yeah they said that they were solar storms or maybe they were the result of the solar storms or maybe\nKind of a thunder caused by a ...\nBut it's also the theory that these are sounds\nThat are being picked up by the human ear that are actually part of these waves that they've been detecting over the planet and we certain people can hear them and some of them have even been recorded so we got a few recording story tonight these are really eerie because I'm sure many of you've heard\nThe sound of it but I just got denied us or something but listening will have an upcoming

that's that's pretty huge no there's no need to panic but there is a cause for concern because we don't know or being exposed to these sounds and those were really listening for the men as I said many people just got it right opposite denied us or something else\nTruth is\nThe universe is a Washington extraterrestrial signals that we cannot even perceive or know about it unless someone else hears them and wants to show you that they're here\nNow the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and and and the uh\nYou know sending of extraterrestrial intelligence that many practitioners although it's been a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted and they're hoping they can find the shores before more people pick up on the sounds but at the moment are buried in the

but it's usually hurt away from the city enforced deserts and are there a turtle over the world okay so\n\nRecently there was a story out of Sweden where there was a mysterious humming ... it was recorded the sound was a constant pulsing hum\nThat according to witnesses lasted forty five minutes\nThe eerie scene was filmed by a man named Renee ... back in December but only recently due to catch the attention of paranormal investigators according to the world are witness Mr Kerr Pinsky notice he basically noticed but there was this odd sound in northern Sweden\nHe said that he was after snowstorm big snowstorm covered mountain top beautiful area quiet morning and get frisky it said they said that the humming noise was constant and seemed to almost vibrate the air above me although he expressed\nCertainty that the harmless coming from the sky ... Pinsky conceded that he couldn't quite determined from which direction was emanating from as it appeared to be coming from every direction in the sky above me also noted the he had visited location before\nAnd it it's unusually very quiet there which was weird because that home could be hurting a quiet area which made the ... it was just made it more mystifying for him and he's you know what it was\nHe said that after about an hour he said the noise dissipated exhibit a move somewhere else\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet a to Z used it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds\nCause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in the middle of nowhere in in the snow in in northern sweet and so here is that sound it is a pulse wave sound became from out of nowhere and uh well explain more about this fall sway sounding what might be going not listen to this or we go\n[noise]\n\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line\nWhere these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some seats had already taken over title thank God I found out in time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you hope title lock will for pennies per day hold tight lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant it detects tampering there on it helping to shut down\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home title lock dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works safe at rhino safe dot com\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture and all security\nAnd if you're like the classic look of our rhino fireworks apes we also feature beautiful matching tool chess and furniture with hundreds of thousands of satisfied customers had a huge network across the U.S we've built our reputation on having the best built best looking and\nMost convenience sake what great surface and warranties and you can get online financing so go with the best\nAnd get style convenience security and true peace of mind with rhino safe dot com today that's rhino save dot com rhino safe dot com dot [noise]\nMoscow bally's great question not crack or twenty six anniversary is performing young south this [noise]\nDid your family I get them all last a lifetime\nExperience world famous Russian dance with a Broadway style state you killed in the press and the number one Christmas experience for children of all ages [noise] celebrate the season for dot com and said ...\nUp hearing it would double the powers auditory December say [noise]\n\n\nJeremiah in Oregon Hi Jeremiah ground zero [noise]\n[noise] oh okay [noise]\nFight like the late ... and I were on her way home from Cub Scouts are over here and we saw that in your but\nSo is ...

S C I oh say oh ... [noise] a truly except for three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three three seven hundred meanwhile\nWe're trying to determine what those sounds were heard out there in a [noise] northern Sweden [noise] northern swing the guy who was recording some weird sounds coming out of out of the sky is the low rumble\nOf it he said he's never heard before\nDidn't sound like a car or a train or anything in the middle of nowhere mountains beautiful snowy mountains\nThen of course there's this weird strange that noise coming out of a Utah in August of from Doug boy proving grounds was very where they may call it the new area fifty one\nSo we have to wonder if these are spaceships or if this is part of a techno signature re\nWhen the sounds the patterns maybe figure boat many in

by hurricane might call so anyway so we were talking about tonight let me just to\nGet back to what we're talking about nine so I'm really I'm fascinated here and I are not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence\nAnd a\nMessaging extraterrestrial intelligence that city in ... and they're beginning to act as though they have located something okay they're not telling us they've located something that I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine they had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to\nIdentify technical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we bought the black cube and the skull on because we wanted to talk about the stigma signatures and maybe some people out there we could pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever so\nWe have to look at various ways\nDid aliens would be able to make contact with this or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also\nAt times even run brought this up we've used it to reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blew they did reduce over the\nAir so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send that huge orange sounds ancient sound\nBut I'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings we've had all kinds of cool things going on\nJust last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it or we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the programming last are seeing that they said that was the only guy reported it and they saw me wonder if anybody else thought\nAnd apparently it had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clues stuff and for more advanced um you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these types of signatures\nWell I also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that ah that there's more to it than just listening for the technology ventures that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the signals affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial singles out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial single so we can't even perceive\nOr do we even know about unless someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the end so city and many the guys that runs city and Medi spent a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted\nThey're hoping they can find the source before more people pick up on the sound at the moment they you know because they're buried it actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise\nBut uh like I said some people are already hearing this policy sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound of the constant pulsing home but according to witnesses lasted forty five minutes to an hour\nOr there was there's a film on the Internet going viral right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you living out there a bunch of guys on a on a snowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland\nOr a man\nBy the name of Renee crew Pinsky\nHad a record of this back in December after snow fall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here is that ...\nNo that's not the hummus try another ... it's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's another home\n[noise]\n\nSo this was filmed by a man named Renee group Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise [noise] that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that he went to like it was rattling the sky\nOr very mystifying you said it was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other\nBig could not figure out what it was it was like some invisible thing will be across the sky was rumbling a sonics out\nIn August there was a report of another home near Doug way proving grounds which of course Doug way proving ground some people say is the northern arm of area fifty one it's in Utah I've been there it has a lot of ah gates in danger science don't go in there and uh\nSo here's that sound of the homicide Doug way which is a
