in um everything else points to rice and there was rice and it was also found a in a Ted Cruz's opera's\nA rice is a popular a way of uh ... actually it's it's a very popular biological to be used because it's easy to make fact it's a\nIt's one of the few poisons is actually found significantly in a in a lot of qualities are they big quantities in nature the um 'cause it's bound and caster beans um and they grow all over the u._s. um [noise] yeah it's one of the few poisons that actually a\n... that are basically you can make or the or the rights of itself you can make in the kitchen um oh you got to do is you make a much I guess this is my Breaking Bad news [laughter] this is my Breaking Bad knowledge you make it with much you make it into a marsh\nAnd then you keep pressing the beans press you it'd be then you have castor oil\nMany of us remember castor oil riots and stuff they used to make you poop Castro it's it's a lax if well basically what you do\nIs the reason why this poison works so well is because what it is that the gums up the protein building machinery and yourself goes right to your DNA that is if you ingest it okay and\nIt it harms cells that are dividing quickly and then it takes it goes to bleeding swelling your blood pressure goes down your organ failure happens then it's pretty pretty nasty\nBut see the ... the specific symptoms depend on how a person is exposed to the rice and and how big it does get that's according to CDC inhaling it can cause breathing problems\nTo build up in the lungs low pressure and that it's not taking care of if you eat it well you're in big trouble because you started vomiting or diarrhea you go into seizures organ failure and man that maybe maybe not but if you injected\nWeakness muscle aches vomiting fevers organ failure\nAnd [noise]\nSo um [noise]\nThis is the type of poison that can kill me not killed depending on the dosage\nAnd it can cause all kinds of above [noise]\nDifferent reaction to

good follow up for that you know when you're talking about this uh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talk to her again a function exercise is something that most people don't know about it I'm bringing to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order

sometimes they see how many people checking the hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the

are\nBarely that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets Bola\nAndy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about

kinds of things\nAre happening and uh it's all happening at once and they said this is a is a gain of these again are forced to exercise\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real things going to go down and when it does you know we all know that this the beginning this is the beginning of the final\nBlow them\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through

too suspicious central ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nIs envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is opening contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can\nChange the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA biological markers that would you would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected if you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling\nA rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each call here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon and ah\nI think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to um distract us from it\nOr there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin I'm going to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWhat a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that tests and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything this peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program\nKnow lived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact you know 'cause I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down and we said oh you know he would\nProbably leave retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy and one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard the we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen or not always ripe or damn close believe it or not or damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nThis gets out of hand [noise] I'd say be prepared because if the work

Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to hey Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the fall it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was was also targeted\n[noise] sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations law but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just to work the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday and he said well ... weeks' time they don't have to wait all they have to do is go back over some existing papers get all their ducks and rode dot the I's properties come back give their decision to vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on\nPeople who don't like the idea get angry and they started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "03"}
