D. C. reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to well they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed too bitter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty people surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year so and and the bad thing is is there is no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nWhat happens is whatever this is you know we were talking about things like eat quite simple lightest we are talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain of a nervous system disaffected nervous system\nEspecially the uh specifically of the spinal cord\nNeurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins or genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\nAre basically there\nFive reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year but there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset\n\nNow we know that medical science is continually making rapid advances we've got new medications that treatments all these things are developed\n\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our water supply and demand I often kind of play the possibility\n\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that the ... the FDA or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most\nBut now can be argued that I after Jay consequences they're not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the fall of the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids react to them in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug\nI mean we know our biological systems are constantly evolving\n\nAnd if we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems both disease causing organisms and\nAnd of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they evolve and adapt where\nCertain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't it it goes dormant for a while and then comes back with a vengeance but right now we need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even our peace or ability to ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\nThe failures of the past have given way to the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising him disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course and ribs in and out of this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to carry medication in particular multiplied\n\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were the anti vaccine they start ridiculing you but just think about all the accidents at all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and do devolved with the ... would be a diseases that are coming of or now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the flock but you're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to uh do do things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things\nThat they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build or we can build all sorts of things that we just know the right things to eat the right things to do is writes supplements to take the right drugs I mean\nI I worry now because uh I've heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine except for light is or giving them some sort of a eastern equine suffer widest or some other a disease that affects\nThe spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nAlthough we are right now\nAt the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd give them an inch arrow virus a polio and non polio and Charles virus that paralyzes them\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases\nAre evolving now whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them the push is another story whether or not\nDrugs or after genetic artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be more\nAnd more ... these cases seemed to happen more and more in the flue last year killed eighty thousand people eighty thousand people [noise]\nIt was because of an ineffective vaccine and a lot of people who took the vaccine or gotten the vaccine were the ones who saw the flu evolved into a very deadly form of pneumonia [noise]\nKilled eighty thousand people last year that is a lot of people to be having die from a simple flew [noise] and I worry about these children that are getting these polio viruses [noise] but he's totally like attacks\nAnd the CDC and the FDA and all these other groups don't understand how they can treated or get rid of it [noise]\nIt's once again a history of evolved pathogens evolve viruses evolve diseases that we have not evolved [noise]\nGone and so there are a lot of [noise]\nThere's a lot of a worry and suspicion about what is happening in Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis\nYou're listening to ground zero\nThe Dan River show weekday mornings today [noise]\nIt all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up to a you know you just basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must in order to prevent this we we suggest that you use mosquito repellent\n\nSo what does that tell you [laughter] what what does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes the very thing that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for a gain a function exercise would be mosquitoes\nA Bill Gates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he added a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\nAnd so once again it's the idea that you know we're we're in the middle of an evolving if it's\nThe balding ... through the bombing diseases bobbing um evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic ... protection\nWould you mean to protect us from the beginning of protect your children from the beginning from what it is it's coming and it's just something that most certainly wouldn't want your children to go through [noise]\nDribbling fix every three thirty seven hundred that's troubling six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases [noise]\nAnd it's the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases [noise]\nI don't believe they are [noise]\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of bat dribble eat six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three

to ground zero that it was called and I believe six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] the pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up with the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up\nWith pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is teaming up with advertising agencies they're reading public service announcements and they're and they're basically pushing a certain\nAttitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know ... it's trying to outsell trying to sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year\n... bio labs have greeted these new super block superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses now turning into an ... virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going to an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you do pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the\nPublic uh ineffective drugs ineffective vaccines in effect the ineffective\nI after Jenike artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo which do see boats no benefit at all and show which is why I I think it's important we should talk about this\nWe should bring this up because I I think that the word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think a flu vaccine is for everyone but after what I've read about what happened last year and how people who got the flu vaccine eventually had a flu that evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this because you can't sue the pharmaceutical company\nBrock Obama put that into law does Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international courts makes the flu vaccine several other vaccines that of course we're being pimped and pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get ... get ... get busy and nothing's working you know they are our children are now getting and Tara viruses non polio internal viruses where they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed\nSame thing with ... as you start getting assuming of sickness and your paralyzed who to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting

tell you about to watch your\nKids to make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them in all by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nBetcha speak volumes to everybody shouldn't it especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream not going to report this to you they're just not\nI mean they'll report it probably eventually but ducking reporter like were reporting it and they haven't been following it since we've been following the clay decks exercise\nFrom

University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work as the on air pharmacists nutritious hosted the bright side radio program Ben Fuchs welcome to ground zero\nHey try and talk to you yeah I Love that doing this show because you are so darn television Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda but when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it get making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show\nA said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose boy what why are they\nDoing off her twenty six for you I answer a fool according to his\nFather you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to cap dispersion on others or whatever their behavior is back to the human body is hardwired to be addicted to substances as hard wired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are\nThey are analogs bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an opiate say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in dodging it opiates and you'll in Athens become efficient by taking artificial opiates you'll end up being the fission which we'll put you in an deficits date and if there's a there's a pills that are right in front of you and be almost impossible to resist them\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farm Mr pharmacist relationship but yeah I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates\nYou you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or your award you're awarded the state\nYeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're ... you're hooked on August ... you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou you're compelled me to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that help people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile\nAnd it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crocodile bit gives your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies saying to me that they were\nAddicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa who have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy\nCalled me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and then one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you do that and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's absolutely terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not to physical damage the psychic pain to to ... pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual pain on and I said I Believe in the pharmacist that this is a really big part of her or an addiction problem is we are in hey\nWe are such a ... a culture that rule horse its citizens are being alive or just citizens for participating in society we live in ... and just ... culture and our ... our nation's or just a
