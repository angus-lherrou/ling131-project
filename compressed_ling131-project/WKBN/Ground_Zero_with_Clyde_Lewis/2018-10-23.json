feeling a little tipsy went to a great party in the afternoon it was one of the afternoon parties thought I'd be okay came on the air\nAnd I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay and the reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid\nI once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family that we because we lived out in this rural area called mid veiled Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning and she kept kids spoke English but uh just barely and uh I used to have this kid named junior but he was really Jose and he spoke English ...

the barbed wire fence got attacked\nBy the head rooster just poking my face is the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens chickens\nMost or just attacking me right and just talking at my face\nAnd Iran to my mom I ran to my dad I'm bleeding\nAnd so my dad goes over of course the old man's over there man he's drunk movie he's drunk and my dad says you're rooster my son in law is me and so I guess the Miguel who is one of the older\nKids\nSodomy bleeding and he said that's it so he went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster with the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes\nAnd it just stops so he grabs a knife and he grabs the nicotine chicken ... ... ... ... head off the chicken right and then\nThe damn rooster comes right after me [laughter] you know you're a little kid writing things coming out the way the way they were they\nHad chopped off and these were bad enough\nJose found it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot and he found the nerve on the end of the chickens putting pull on it in the chickens that she can

I think there's a lot different than that you okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flight with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of someone's never they talked about on coast to coast day I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths\nGave the movie the mist remember the missed\nIt was a it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke science can beat us with dimensional theories the point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil it's dinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to be the most powerful due to their position to be the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporters that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project and the whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped a small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great widow wars and they can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like cloth and flesh and both the book in the film great widow where's simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... put it in the film\nThey also had the ability to capture and lay off hundreds of eggs\nIn the living human host\nThe egg take about a data hatch and they multiplied quickly now\nThe looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that a dump Toro did this show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies\nBecause of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is gets to me the size of a human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature\nSee when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in the movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie and then they said we based many of their the creatures\nOn supposed second genesis creatures that were proposed by site\nThere were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is the Canadian company sewing machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of kindred systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up your bonded with others that was back in twenty fourteen any dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is what is the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a suit nominee or demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old ones spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty and like creatures to come through\nSounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis took place\nAnd and I mean I played the the the Ted talked before we talked about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it\nBut he says something effect he says well what I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we are going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different the the things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say waste smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of alarm with people right I mean\nYou know one must says you know if you're playing with a guy you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon the little guy you know where the ... you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to weigh about it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo you're copying this attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature\nSo opening up the worm holes and letting these creatures through a very very very terrifying prospect\nAnd it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing anyway and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when we see it\nIt's it's it's just too much
