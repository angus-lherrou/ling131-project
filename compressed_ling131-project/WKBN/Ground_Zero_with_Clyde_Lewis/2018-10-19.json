our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where because we know that no one truly lives in the universe is fully objective\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time\nOr hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they wanted me halfway with their religion they want to eat half way with the conscious this they want to do ... and this is where I was looking for about how here we are going to shift this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is in that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say well it's not true if it's just what you think it is see\nIt's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know the selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we'll be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light lifelike love survival spirituality God you know\n[noise] and then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus was placed in a limited area known right then and then compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving this guy since so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd the subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've\nHad to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling at all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted the experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion\nIt's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now over what George Orwell called\nDouble speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue is provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing\nSee many people but if they have not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nAh by George Orwell usually you know they say things that were big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to

we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling her confirmation bias\nSo this process where not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted us or is it Lee ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters and PCs or the newest means that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is I mean there are there are NBC's in games gamers do an end PCs are\nOkay I'm actually an PCs are computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out but they've created is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda\nAnd I think ... cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically the expressionless face this kind of like I'm\nA statement face or is it ... and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend Twitter responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the MP seem as they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it the online you know where you go to look at messages on fortune read it they started using the term and PC to refer to liberals and these people said well they said that you know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned a parrot left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so you look at one of these and PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has a pointy noses in a blank face\nAnd it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little commercial about ah the computer and all these people were sitting the masses we're seeing that they're all bald and kind of like staring like zombies that's exactly what this is\nThe actual symbol of that that sort of big brother drone image if you are [noise] so uh [noise] this is a program in a counter programming left and ah it's certainly a\nIs working [noise] it was really irritating people with what they have said that this was really interesting it got me thinking a lot\nAbout how this kinda simplify things that makes it appear like we are easily programs like we're in some sort of a matrix\nWhere algorithms in technocrats whomever is doing pushing the button is pulling the strings is getting people to go in certain directions and it's really odd and to watch it if you're not part of it you can stay neutral you can see how this is all going nuts\nA
