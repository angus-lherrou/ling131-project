violence all we've been hearing violence violence violence now\nTo Hillary Clinton sits down to ... ... and and uh and this is this is what she said that\nNow I Want to point out that is the question and the answer and Christianity when she says to Hillary she mentions a few things that really crack me up one I talk about history rhyming okay remember I talked about that first dark history rhyming she says we are seeing a dark mirror of a vast\nRight wing conspiracy or a bass left wing conspiracy she says she said the Kellyanne Conway she says she's saying that there is a vast left\nWing conspiracy mirroring Hillary what you said about a vast right wing conspiracy so she's talking about history mirror ringer rhyming like I said\nAnd then what you get is she able to reach response listen to this\nKellyanne Conway presidential adviser talks about this process and she said it looks very much like a bomb left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being sued by investigations back in the nineties Abbas white right wing conspiracy\nSocial your comment on that mirrored language ethically\nDo you see any way even a conservative think speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some civility and to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see a return to stability listening to one another or working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and

civility was a number of flights for example the New York post newspapers saying civil war civil war civil war\nA number of people going to the Internet saying oh it it feels like we're civil war even um you know there were a lot of people\nJames Woods a matter of fact the actor James Woods\nWas tweeting actually got shadow banned for tweeting that if if if Hillary Clinton wants civil war will give them a civil war\nSo out whatever was shed you know and I talked about how I felt like we were in the middle of one number of them were threatening and Hillary Clinton said well you know we're not going to be civil unless you know we take back what we have and Donald Trump says well if we lose there will be violence\nSo\nWhat is that going to do for America I mean what are you going to do about this that's the question I have is that you know and so you go to the Internet and you try to you know state where you want to stay on Facebook what is Facebook do well\nThey go after eight hundred Web pages shut them down eight hundred a Facebook pages especially some that have a lot of power like a nation and distress\nIt was the first online publication ... President Trump um three point two million likes three million followers gone\nGone because of a what they were what they were saying back then of course ah ... seven hundred thousand followers attacked Trump referred to Republicans as cheating scum bags so a political rhetoric they were saying it was done because\nThey were ... I think what was going on is probably both of them had something to say about the civil war or the idea of a civil war and that they were taking down\nBecause it just seems to me they were going pretty good but they only mentioned these I think these ... these are the ones to make them look like they did this uh you know fairly you take away a conservative you take away a liberal you know what they're saying is we're taking weeks stream it\nOr removing the extremists from the Internet then in eighty five page briefing comes out called the good censor leaks to the press\nFrom Google which advisors all of the tech companies to police tone instead of content and not to take sides with censoring users ah you know this is their rushed to say wow we got to do something because it it we ... we show our hand and say that we can remove all the conservative viewpoints\nThen there's going to be held to pay with the conservative\nSo\nWatch these moves these movies are very important to watch\nBecause\nWe see this internal leak a Google we realize\nThat of course well this okay this is what they were saying in their in their memory to some of the fact that they believe in change they they said we will change with the times if necessary meaning that if they just so happened to wipe out if you search entries based on tone then they can make that dragging my deal with China and no one will feel that this is some sort of people move\nThis is what the briefing says if I can get it out quick says Google might continue to shift with the times change and get stance on how much or how little it censors due to public governmental or commercial purposes or pressures if it does\nTake knowledge when what this shift in position means for users in for Google is essential shifting blindly are silently in one direction or another rightly insights users fury\nAnd I think about that okay so\nBoth sides say violence gay November you don't vote Republican violets ... says we will not be civil until we take over [noise]\nWhere you have to leaders threatening violence hoping their their their zealous followers will start a civil war [noise] but then you see the Internet now going after Web sites that are radically inclined both liberal and conservative [noise]\nAnd then Google issues a statement saying that we certainly don't want to eliminate certain viewpoint [noise]\nTo start dating site users fury [noise]\n\nSomething scaring the K something just scared them and I think what scared them you are the statement [noise]\nYou've heard from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump [noise]\n\nThey don't want to be responsible for civil war they don't want to be viable for civil war and now the media has got to wise up too because they're encouraging it

would do if we look through history was we see that a frightening populists and invited populace a well tried and true results come from that\nAll the same succession sequences as other moments in history like the times of Hitler's why mar Soviet Russia Mao's China and as I've talked about many times the Argentine dirty war\nSo what if something happened that would create a small uprising or a big surprise me and that uprising turned into full on civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary events in history had small skirmishes before the big ones are up to ... and this is why now\nWe should take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the mob rule or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse and the reason why I say this is because of the fact that a couple of nights ago I did a show called new a new justice no peace\nAnd ah I attempted to point out that the traditional way we think of civil war in this country has crowding the fact that we're already\nIn one and while no one will attribute school shootings the pizza gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left in writing knowledge that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\nPresident Trump warned\nThat there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people and I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left many people have told me the left or violent quiet you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't when\nHe's now being foot noted in being pointed out by the news that the you know they're basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways and extremism\nEven more intense after CNN's Christian um and poor sat down with an interview with Hillary Clinton I'll listen to what Christian ... says she talks about\nThe mirror and the black nearing or the dark mirroring and the idea of a vast left wing conspiracy against Donald Trump and listen to what Hillary Clinton's response was\nCan Conway presidential adviser talked about this process and she said it ... left wing conspiracy it echoes what you said about when your husband was being presented by investigations back in the Nineteen ... white right wing conspiracy\nSocial you comment on that mirror language and secondly\nAnyway even a ... speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and just try to make it even if we have political disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to pass return to civility listening to one another I'm working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that has certainly not the administration that we have in power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice on the ...\nI think they did I mean to keep it the same court said open for a year\nOr to deny it distinguish jury couldn't voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they don't ...\nAnd that was such a breach a horn of Africa and

that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse band or the panel that twin ... started again\nSo she says when we get the Senate back that's was civility we'll start again but until then civility or instability if you will will not continue you cannot\nBe civil with a political party that wants to destroy you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe we're fortunate enough to win back the White House in or the Senate that's when civility can start again there you have a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we have this instability until we get the votes so\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not that their vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\nIn order to change the direction of the vote\nAnd that's that's very
