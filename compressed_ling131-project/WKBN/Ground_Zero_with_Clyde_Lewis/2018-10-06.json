equals the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter\nAnd it's interesting the philosopher versus the days that have ah the tigers\nHe and many other ancient philosophers thought of

cube and uh we wanted to have him come on in ... quite a recording us with it Ryan Gabler course veteran radio personality the secret teachings on the program was that we bring them on right now Hi Ryan how are you\nI'm doing great quite as well I'm Glad to be here thank you very much for having me\nSo I'm sure you looked over a ... my notes for tonight and you have your own notes oh this is very important because I think people are beginning to see like we were talking about the arch of bail and how that has a representation that it was directed during the time of the of\nThe cabinet Ford are discussions\nThat it represented sexual perversion uh the killing of babies and sacrifice\nNow we're getting into the numbers game are getting into numbers and we're getting into a what is coming maybe a a footing of war in the future and these numbers are all adding up give us an idea of what the black cube is and what it represents and how it is\nSort of a a a a voice box or recorded for what is going to happen\nFirst off on the subject of ball or bell ball or bell in relation to sexuality is interesting because ... is a fertility got on the fact of the black cube if we look at religion and we look at history we fly if we find the black ... all over the world we find the Jews used the black cube called the capital in a little kid where they have a piece of paper inside of it with a prayer on it\nWe have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ... is a black cube located centrally within all ... all\nAround the sacred site of Muslims that mecca\nAnd then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which is a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called\nA and historical days and that Cuba's representation of those fire deities so you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult\nStudies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square so you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived from the number of that planetary intelligence and it said\nThat each of these intelligence is has a\nForm of consciousness that is free from the body free from flash it the more it'll ended assists and all things that are\nThat are of God if you will and so physical son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual son in the material sun and in the ... law ... law you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish believes there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and ... equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross\nAnd that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers both of those spiritual essence is are derived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns in six rows\nEach line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one and every row every line one one one time the six\nColumns and rose equals six six six so that is a number of the sun then of course is the magic square of Saturn which is a square with three columns and three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen and numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to numerology when\nYou count to ten and just start over again one two three four five six thirty nine\nTen is one again and so on and so forth a number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get\nThe magic square of sat there and ... six six six Saturn is the father\nI heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter and it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and Peter is Potter father as in the dark father or the dark lord the lord of the rings of Saturn the black cube is a representation collide of the material world and it is on the hero card\nBoth a magician at the beginning of the deck and\nThe devil tarot card a representation of man's binding to the material world\nWhat was interesting is that I was very ah fixated on something or Fort Night or in one of the seasons Leon play sport night\nWas noticing that there was a a black cube that showed up from out of nowhere that was in ah ah the area there that are leading was trying to figure out how to conquer it and uh I don't know exactly what happened but apparently the Cuban transformed itself\nInto a floating land mass over the area and I was fascinated by this because the cube itself had what looked like a Jewish riding on it it had a number of things with my gold Hebrew writings\nAnd I I was curious as to why that would show up in a game it had to it at a very a cold ah I guess overtone and symbolism to it that I was very ah mesmerized by it I figured this image is not going to go away his image is going to be appearing in a lot of ways\nAnd not only that but it's

your red treat to have it in the studio again and we welcome back to the show bill home and Hi Bill\nHere it's a it's always interesting\nFor sure yeah tonight as it's going to be even more interesting because as I said earlier when you came in we were going to not only take a look at is what we call ancient technology we may paired up with the technology we have that basically taps into the consciousness of the planet\nWhich is of course what it is the scolded at the time of its construction because crystal itself is a recording mechanism it absorbs the the entire consciousness of the planet and how old is the skull bill\nWell you know there's other all kinds of people with all kinds of things it's\nBelieved to be one of the Thirteen original skulls which would put it a pre ... so what ages that I'm not really sure\nSo is he Priya Dominic it would ... be pre a dynamic I mean we go all the way back before ...\nUh well it's in all that it's your gas as good as mine 'cause you know it's the most amazing artifact than what I Do with it mainly is use it because it as a tool for helping people especially right now that the world seems like it needs a lot of help and the skull is works on that very well\nPsycho Ryan was saying he said we need to take these symbols and we need to take away the warped values an add value to them and use them to help us guide us and uh and to keep us you know pretty much on track for what these I mean sure a lot of problems she may be dark a lot of props you may not be\nGood but there's always hope that as a lead with it as well and I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing and I think the ... the minds of men\nGiven hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major changes in what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever\nWe can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull a you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about uh schools but when you see the ... and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd it uh it just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a\nIt's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing school this is the one that ah I've always admired for its were would ship and how beautiful it is and the power it's certainly possesses ... through\nAnd the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling it's certainly a is inspiring a and and I guess for people who knew nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and\nLike you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a receptor cola mind in this reciprocal remind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so\nUh it's it's here and it's it comes through is very\nVery a shuttle but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot of things that tonight we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join into the program tonight we of Gerald Davis coming up\nTonight who we've found on the program before she's a medium uh also uh I guess the psychic can away she's she's she is a person who communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Seventy Phelps who which has come on the program tonight and of course we have a with is also a we have a a ... von ...\nEat in the evening or nothing happened and why and what is what is ... what does your mind if he's written books about the crystal skull heavy not\nA he's he's one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works with them for a number of years he's written books he's a doctor and a a he has a lot to say about my that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nOr even a drop out let's go let's go to job right now job you there yeah I mean here\nAnd it's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it began ... experience all and in Nineteen but looked at the Nineteen Ninety four I met ... well at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal skull that somebody puts in my hand\nAnd a ... disclosed eyes are asked me to feel\nThat I started to cry like a little baby\nAnd that was for reason to stop a ledger and he goes why would a girl up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull and what's interesting because as well as a cult

working list crystals calls as\nConsciousness yes they were mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but it's also

use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access at a lot of the interesting things and that is is\nWe have not being very successful yes there are channels and that
