I I just like it's very comfortable\nAnd uh I just thought it was awesome she got me this massive shirt because it just makes me feel on NASA like you know it's cool but uh\nYeah a NASA gives me such Natasha ... they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kind of\nRatcheting and feel will stick to my stomach I\nKnow the earliest days with us space exploration situation ... one of the most fascinating chapters of human history that's why I like NASA 'cause I like reading about Gus Grissom on like reading about uh you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Sharon in ... and I I like reading about all these guys\nYou know I write a report about the team um I got in my office and maybe if I get wrong to\nGet out of the opposite I can take a picture and put on a on Facebook I've got\nUm\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something it's supposed to be the Apollo Thirteen no not ... fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed idea which is kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he work for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me oh it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that\nWas telling me you should do shows about this shows by that ask why this isn't happening and that's and that and every big conspiracy theories about NASA he worked for them to actually so yeah you're going to see first band is gonna be\nBecause it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen or any other space movie running with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort to go to the moon and they had limited time table and their efforts gave us the Gemini ...\n... and the Apollo moon landing with Neil Armstrong acting is the first human ... to an extraterrestrial world\nAnd there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and\nAnd go in and doing it and you know\nTouching putting his foot on lunar soil and all that whether or not there aliens there whether or not they saw structures they're I mean\nThere's all kinds of things that you can speculate about but almost from the point of the first Apollo mission there were many Americans they expressed skepticism that the whole event taking place at all it had\nThey argued been faked in Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury the complex conspiracy theories involving international intrigue murderous criminality also using money to foot the war effort in Vietnam this was all thrown together it was a propaganda basically a propaganda scam\nTo make the Russians feel inferior and to be honest it worked\n\nWas whatever it was I mean the Russians were ahead of us in the space race then one day they find out that we've got a man on the moon to me is that how we don't want to do that and see and that's what it was always bothered me about the moon landing as we landed on the moon\nAnd it's kinda like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top there are several other people that want to climate adversity the saying they don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like ... we go about every sweet land on Mt Everest and the Russians that works so hard to go about average decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they in the second on the moon why when when the when the whole fever pitch was going on we were the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up there Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\n\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission\nThey would rather you know watch Lucille Ball I mean what are\nYour rather watching Lucille Ball wondering of busier near this kid or whoever it was good to have a baby or I it was like you know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one cool second one okay third one huh [laughter] okay about about how their lives ruined thing if you're a lot of people that had skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all when we landed\nThe amount of Americans\nBetween the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old Mrs figures from the Nineteen sixties uh twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon and over the years there have been many more dollars and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science dinner you're up there with Blatter's right\nUh [noise] that's about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time now and there are a lot of people who don't believe\nThat was it turns out throughout the latter through the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first confidence in the United states government by the American public had been in decline in those remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate the nine eleven attacks all these other scandals malfeasance\nMay find it easier to say well you know the governor's lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied was about the moon landing and what's really weird is is that\nYou know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing is probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nThat you know using ... you can question nine eleven and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was the most horrible event and history and you're questioning of people died that you get that all the time you're talking about Watergate you you do some\n... they don't care about what it is I don't care about Monica Lewinsky is dressed but yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that\nYou look at all the money they put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years\nAnd the rockets or what happened to them and you know all these questions that people have it and when you start speculating they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back at a pow Lebanon and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths and the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out in the space and nothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the\nWhen the alarm on the Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife says you're not going to the moon no way oh yeah I Am I mean I'm going to the moon no not after you crossed the lunar lander honor as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not going to crash it on the moon I trust me we're not going to do that\nI think the space shuttle blows up or astronauts are killed by a shot in the program for a year to figure out what the hell happened back then ah we got a timetable to meet you know Neal if you cross the lunar lander tough luck Charlie you're going up into space you're doing that one small step for man speech\nThat's what happened\nAnd you're going to do it with technology but so the equivalent of the computer technology in your toaster of it that's how we're going to do with guys and you're going to be sitting in something the size of a phone booth with those huge backpacks on your back here to take pictures of the moon was something called the oven mittens\nHi you're going to do it well we got all figured out\nNow there's ... how is this going to be done without people question what we've got that I'll figure it out to no one will question it it'll be the most brilliant thing ever you're going to the moon and you know you're going to the moon and the American people know you're going to the moon except except that [noise]\nThere are a lot of things we're not going to tell them about how we're doing is magic [noise]\nAnd a lot of things were going to forget about once you've gone [noise] and we forget about it

looked like he broke in [noise] [laughter] what about Capricorn One that was Nineteen Seventy eight right [noise]\nUh that's where NASA supposedly bake the landing on Mars be a lot of people that they\nCan do it on the ... they did a pretty convincingly two thousand what a space odyssey wow [noise] some people say that even Star Trek which canceled before the moon shot because\nThey were afraid that if they were running Star Trek were a bunch of\nMen land on a fake planet but somebody will get the idea oh yeah just like\nThey do in Star Trek [noise] that's why a star trek cat ... had

[laughter] but it was all just popped in in the jaw\nUm so yeah I mean people get all kind of had a big shift if you tell them I doubt I doubt that we went on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you'd be skeptical about everything else but it may you start being skeptical about the moon landing\n\nIt's like you've kicked the pope somewhere and it's not a part it's it's really a bad thing people don't like it well I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and uh you know I had them even more now after what I read today\nUm you remember back in when was that it was a two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen\nAnd he said the natural adjusted new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and you get duct that first manned mission no later than twenty forty\n\nWell here we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about setting the first speech to receive signing and land on the movie industry go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set about being a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with making huge inflatable moon basically I could have been done even a Mars base could've been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the natural was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about ... what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting on the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah of\nCourse NAFTA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a copy a crater that's about six miles wide\nAnd that you know people say oh my God they're gonna new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty pound of Russia first landing on the ...\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about\nThat mission that did all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nNew space vehicles were slated to replace masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards that but I bet that climate change climate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn announcing the climate change beliefs and that's that's really sad I mean there was ever a time of the doubt that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream we're gonna probably many forward than Obama's\nJust not not we're not going to go\nSo here we are in twenty Eighteen\nAgain been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\nTo to the stories today that I Want it to\nAre you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news\nFirst of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds ah apparently may have detected would appear to be to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars they'll try and dig it up but uh yeah they they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they are moving us after we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\n\nI'm kidding I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars soccer stars ... before them out there saying well if these\nLook like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\n[noise] um [noise]\nNASA also reported today that Seventeen scientists\nOften report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study about life rigid on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we have Seventeen scientists and guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\nOnce again\nEvery mission is going to be about finding life in space to have to have a question of finding life in space\nSays they picked up on to quote colliding stars but maybe a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission have to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the reason reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst\nOr the motivation behind the quest\nI don't know that it has anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with the techno signatures\nAnd get this astrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into complex the diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\n\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions shooting corporate technology and find traces of alien organisms bio signatures techno ... I mean look our president of the universe is more crammed with plants never before\n\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding bio signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report scientists recommended at NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument that can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals in organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star light should be used outside our solar system to improve the ... ... signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA good also plan more missions that that peer under the surface of exoplanets\n\nWhether or not they're rock the icy or ocean worlds defined subterranean daily life according to the report however [noise]\nEfforts to locate are extraterrestrial neighbors either in
