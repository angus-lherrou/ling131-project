Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to talk about him as well they puff it at a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump's stubborn Donald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nDo ah out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic hits you know of a of a noted officials may kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all that certainly is controlling this country and is trying to control the world\nSo all we're arguing various uh you know or are getting a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy he's\nThere\nTo metal in the affairs of nations all over the world\nThat are struggling to keep their sovereignty\nAnd this is why there are few oligarchy\nOr willing to buy up and support chaos in the world\nAnd this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing this on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out you see the warning of a major collapse of the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there are many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country and not the bad actors on the world stage that wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burned the truth is there are many Americans that have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the clutching cup of seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change that if you're a people will stop and realize they've all

United states is starting to resemble\nSome sort of a dystopian a Nineteen eighty four those do you have ski um possession by demons type of thing um in fact I brought up those ... story\nOr when I did my show the other night uh when I was talking about\nUh what was happening in Portland or we had over the weekend we had a the the the rival ah groups get together and fight in downtown Portland and so uh it was a certainly you know under being the things that I had to stay out again and do work\nOr because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be in on the ah I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things that are being planned I Want to know 'em\nI Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the doubles it's a book that was written by a dusty as ski\nAnd off it was pre revolutionary or if it were at the details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent than ... expected to revolt in a way to the time when the people would rise to the occasion\nAnd give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nDenial is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time whether\nPeople would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving the power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\nYou know I began and does the U.S his book and began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired and state power that\nHappened you know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders with a blood bond or the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a of of a you know group said to\nAre supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore I mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this dividing infighting his anti liberty\nIt really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand or except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the alright they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ... but there's also others and you know we have to learn and we have to remember\nThat there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood Samantha back in time of Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the blue kite blue kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style is is I Would do civil instability\nInstability was reduced incivility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this guy stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nIt's the way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics and economic units to be bought sold barter traded in track\n\nIt lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn\nAnd they love to violent their empire so what they do is they create wars they they uh they take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little\nAnd so we have is deep state that is a myth superpower\n... worldwide deep state of global industrial the state\nAnd so it\nMight get like you know network where are the Ned Beatty says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that is that that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we\nWe were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up rising up all the middle eastern terrorists and now it's us but it needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate it's failed us\nAnd and what they have is they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically\nThis was the talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't\nLike we burned the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be got be happy with themselves unless they pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this coercive solution or this course to project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step and
