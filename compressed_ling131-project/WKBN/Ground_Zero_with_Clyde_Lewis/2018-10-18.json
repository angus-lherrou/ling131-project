I mean I don't know if anybody remembers me mentioning but I remembered it okay somebody else or there would be saying this now\nI went back I went back to semi shows to try and find it I couldn't find it where I said\n\nLike I I did say I I Swear I said and then um I asked my friend Sarah said that I say this is she listened to the show and I think she called me and she said uh how how does this what what what about this space armada thing\nAnd I and so I remember her calling me she remembers calling me because I asked her about it\nAnd so\nI tend to take some of these strange stories I just I bookmark them and they put them in my\nIn a file right and so I came in this morning after I had lunch or actually it was afternoon after I had lunch with my friend John and I went to look for that story because I wanted to you know I wanted to\nFind that the the guy who emailed me treated me are sent me a message saying I'd found the story this is all I got\nBut I looked all over the Web today I ... I just searched high and low all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists these dark clusters the big the alien armada think they're an alien formation or some UFO formation\nCould not find the story\nAt all sure he was gone\nI Will commute to try and find the story on Google if you're near a computer and send it to me on Twitter so to me and my in my Facebook feed I I'm more than happy\nTo uh you know they'd Mitt that maybe it is there but I cannot find that story\n\nCan't find that story\nSo it was like one of those off the cuff comment so I didn't do any research on I'm picking wild any research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott Reed emails me all the time and he kept mentioning the story about or have you seen this video this video is going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform your military and he said that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object just about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but\nUm there are rumors flying around as to why beat this this this this outage occurred\nLast night\nAnd the cheap rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube released there purporting to show a man in uniform announcing that something\nLarge he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nAs I said I was notified by email and Scott if you're lifting please send an email again I Want I Want to know if you send an email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know who you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about men or that that footage of something hitting the moon\n\nFrom what I understand is that they shut down YouTube last night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video they didn't want that video to go viral fled to shut down the system\nDonnie buddy system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow if a if I Can't find proof of this and I can't find a video or if I Can't find the story about the armada and a stark clusters and the Russians and the art\nThe story it all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nMaybe got leaked out and it wasn't supposed to be hurt or ... or or thought about right so\nScience fiction disinformation maybe maybe somebody to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really was it really science fiction dish information really because of the circumstances it just seems a little odd\nRussians say they see be stark let's just say but they don't want to start clusters they look like do you remember the famous then you may remember me saying this on the air\nSo what I'm Talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia said that they're seeing ... looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember he said something about that have been able to find that quote\nBut I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did say it\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious who's the guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my emails he'd be on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's writing me back immediately\nUm see no he hasn't written me he has not\n\nWell somebody sent me some better Russian star clustered [noise]\nNo that's not in jail thank you what this is your story [noise] which is your story [noise] I'm thinking of somebody

have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted the ballistic descended Bob the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the awestruck successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back\nBut that shawndra X ray observatory when did the same boat and all that all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure according to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope\nComponent in charge of pointing and stabilizing telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA\nDoes not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bullets and it hasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices\nTwo year old a two year old or organization the NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all it was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know it was sixty million dollars I went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of climate it's proportions\nThe White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have not been concerned about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\n... white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario that sounds too weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty Eighteen\nAnd then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after\nThe September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I don't I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is it it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really bizarre all day today a lot of tension in my neck a lot of ah I couldn't concentrate\n... around the moon I'm there yeah\nThat's yeah there was yeah it was weird and I you know you get\nSo when you look at the shadow them on the side of the dark side where it was just started I which I couldn't figure out it was stored I kept looking at it looking at it and looking at throwing all night when I got closer towards a western part of the United states\nUh it was it cleared up and the owner was Vegas how I mean I could see it then I you know I shut my day off I stopped and turned myself off but uh that's up throughout the night\nFrom right the chime nightfall yet so I stopped around so four or five o'clock and I'm\nWell I'm going to have somebody sent me a somebody sent me a video of the moon and in the cloud and coming in and it's not something they're and they're saying but nothing happened to the moon the infield there well they all you see the little white headlight like being in the sky and the ...\nThe footage that I was seeing from a genetics army with something far more compelling and that is something cropping when infrared that'd be that night vision\nAnd you could see it in half of the moon it was amazing so something did happen last night we just haven't found the video did the guy in uniform was saying something was going to hit the moon there was allegedly why you to shut down so anyway

uh\nThat you all the all these things are going down and we we talked about a Scientific American a\nStory that indicated that something was happen something was happening in Antarctica is that uh I thought sounded like it would seal the deal on ... communication and it ...\nThe story was there's these bizarre particles that keep flying out of Antarctica is ice and they might shattered modern physics there were saying that fits the justice aren't knowing exactly what these things are\nAre there are high particles bitter blast they usually blasts through space into the planet now they're coming out of the planet to go into the planning to go out of the planet and so these particles you know they make up what scientists call ... you know the standard model and these things break\nThe particle physics standard model and so scientists are going this has gotta be something\nBut it could be alien perhaps something alien\nYou know it and they're saying this could be this means that uh something is leaving behind a trail\nAnd unknown trail in ... and I don't know if it's communication with some some guys will be fuel it's burning or what have you but since March or twenty sixteen
