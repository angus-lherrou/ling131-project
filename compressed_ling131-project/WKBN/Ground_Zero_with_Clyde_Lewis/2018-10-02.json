tick but I I think it's time to start looking at the\nNext generation I mean the millennials are establishing themselves now okay calmed down about millennials I Want to start talking to my generation Z\n\nGeneration Z they were born proximity between Nineteen Ninety five and twenty fourteen okay that includes my step son\nMy other son's a millennial when he's pretty well established himself now

and all that gives them a ... house or a small amount of time to do anything the only say that tendency is going to continue that they like the Internet of things and it's a it's like\n\nA intelligent animal vast a scattered everywhere like like confronting when everything\nI think it's\nIncreasingly hard things to work out how to deal with that\nSo it's like confetti this uh evil dust is a evil intelligent dusty talking about right that um it's a it's everywhere\nAnd I remember we said that was in his intelligent evil dust ah because of this quote unquote top secret thing we revealed a back lash ... even a few weeks ago I Believe a three or four weeks ago\nThat we talked about this need classified statement that ah you know somehow they were releasing nanoparticles nano robots\nAre and of course Muskie even talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project and nano domestic Quayle was was something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the deliverance of the\nOf the notion in the declassified statements\nAnd we said well look very nerd but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lotta I'd said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program it was a writer and he said uh who has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have a propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\n\nAnd man I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense it's a pseudo science this is crazy and now ...\nYou said that he made this he made the statement before he's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on with joined us on right now just today well\nI don't know if I have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because ah today as I was looking over some of the the reports\nAnd in the in the clip service I I go in every day they check out the clip service don't these reports I have a link some kinds of stuff of the stuff that I use the stuff that I don't use but I always have to see things in a follow up senses I talked about the beginning of the program the blowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you talk about it all boils back you have to say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about a ... and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going to install smart city networks in your part of the woods and you got to do it quick because if you don't we're going to go in and do it for you\n\nSo let's roll control spectrum is giving mandatory by twenty twenty or at least moving into twenty thirty\nRight\nAnd so the FCC say it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done that people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're gonna have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance matrix they want to put in there but how are they gonna move all those sensors\nHow they had him put trillions of sensors in place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nIt's a that's a lot of sensors deporting bike but within two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's\nEasier to drop trillions of nano particles the size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it\nIn a less amount of time I'm sure they're reporting sensors in the bigger and and and more capable and and fiber\nOptic and all this stuff that could put that in and yeah the destruction is going to change and yeah the matrix of all things are going to change your city of tomorrow weights but while they're still trying to get things settled while they're trying to get the antennas in place for five gee they will dust\nOff if they have an dusted is already within\nA particular
