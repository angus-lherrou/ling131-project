be with my radio program\nAnd that he is [laughter]\nI Know there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready when I was in South America and I lived there and I lived there in the middle of ... out in the middle of it was toward the end of their civil war that was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war\nI self civil war and a whole new light it was different than the two sided civil war we have in the Eighteen hundreds it was uh something else it was civil war in contemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nWhen I say when the Saudis I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a South America is Spain or France or or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's an amazing city\nVery urban very er advanced but an advanced technologies there because they try out down there seemed to work down there\nThey do they move up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so\nThe biggest concern for\nA lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what what is going on\n\nAnd when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet I always hear people say why it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know do they know did they ever lived through one day they know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nI said to myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of a reality that uh is out of control\nI mean we have new laws and you have executive orders that pretty much enable the president\nTo act with the emergency Powers Act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works is some sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see a big and legally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or or this or you know very soft coup\nOr the the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft coup\nOther behaviors with a you\nKnow certain people and how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean look\nI Know that if you say that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing this he's planning on exposing\nAll the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\n\nAnd the political sour grapes get political splinter groups and with political splinter groups you get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not as the fragmentation of our republic that destroys us it will destroy us for sure\nAnd there will not be and there is not I repeat there is not a unanimous front\nAgainst an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves\n\nAnd we're easily exploited easily exploited by political Jagger nuts that have been hijacked by\nNeo cons anarchists socialist anti ... black lives or you go down the list\nOkay and the media basically\nAll of the American people like sheep and it being joiner is and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive coats\nAnd these groups do nothing to further the cause of change\nIt solves the entire process as it appears to be mired in nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Myra fanaticism is beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or a pepper spraying the homeless or what have you or feeling here in America\nIs that it's wise to have a gun or everybody's saying the gun violence should be curbed that\nYou should you know revisit the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still wanting armed security and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry and you're feeling in the United states is if you're going to have at least\nA gun then you should have at least some stored food batteries radios and you'll become swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks in the homeland thrown unseen enemy but be unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemy is within and the enemy is among all of us\nBack or what was it um yes if you years ago\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or the or else someone will come in and do it for us\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group is safe unless it's legally armed organized overly advocating a return of more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government run amok\nUm\nI remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict on American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\nYou actually they were having Lincoln an Eighteen sixty was the final straw for many southerners in an all eleven states or they were eleven states that the the seed it from the union for these Virginia Arkansas and North Carolina Tennessee did not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve fifty sixty one five additional states were border slave states\nThey didn't succeed from the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland in Delaware\n\nNow we're not talking about secession tonight I'm not even though there are a number of\nStates since that basically have said they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been what they want to separate the three states and in Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and than they ever you know the constitution says they can\nBut Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean\n... when Obama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to see they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff and see now that's just trivial path that they like to spread out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the end of the the the thought that ah\nThere's a part in the declaration of independence\nI Want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm a part of the declaration of independence that says something that the governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends\nIt is the right of the people to alter abolish it and Institute a new government\nSo adding insult to injury [noise] um [noise]\nWe the people [noise]\nAre engaging

battles no one will listen because there are vendettas to be settled and revenge is a dish that his best serve cold in America\n\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad Clyde and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it's certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed\nAnd they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it is a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern days in a modern city modernist city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you would be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states the civil war would be similar except now we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle it would regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\nSeattle we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done\nOrder to provoke a response if the response was overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police\nOr the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with how or if if if\nThere is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if there will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believes me into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now that if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no it's not how it's going to be\nThat's not what a civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not modern civil war would have many so called side's seeing the dirty war South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is\nKind of nice to the radical ... the communist coming east is the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police the moderate stay in a plaza I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we'd have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too\nBut all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man who was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allow the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAn elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\n\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car on the other surrounding the man was out numbered\nProbably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nGuy had about three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again of a civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWe could see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nThere are separatists groups that America's militia groups oath keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together\nAnd feel the flames for civil war\nOther insurgency Kelly's can be criminal gangs like MS Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August fifteenth twenty four team the mainstream news was reporting on the events are happening in Ferguson,
