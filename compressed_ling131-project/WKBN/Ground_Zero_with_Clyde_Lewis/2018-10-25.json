crumbling would geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them thoroughly it would be considered civil war in other countries I mean they'd say well look at every ... or ... we're on the outside looking into what's going on here we'd say ooh that\nCountry's in civil war today I woke up uh with the news about these suspicious packages that allegedly contain pipe bombs that were sent to the Clintons the Obamas and to CNN's offices in New York and this happened the day after George Soros the\nYeah the suspected explosive device putting his mailbox\nWell this is ... mass hysteria in the news rooms that are predominantly left wing and and and the the the left wing mouth pieces are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault\nAgain but this is happening it's got to turn down the rhetoric ... saying that news is fake all these the the excuses to just explain the attack is similar to\nThe rice in biological effects that happened before the Kavanaugh decision was made it as I reported there would be a final blow\nEvent\nThere was certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um\nIt failed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare\nOkay\nWhen I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks so I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the ... when the infowars again and Alex asked me what is next quiet what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not have an event would start a war footing in the United states\nAnd he said I agree I agree well today I was notified of the attempted bombing was sent an email\nThat featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article from the Daily Beast and this was a headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical leaves me they symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order declared a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be a suspect in order for the accusation stick and what I mean by that is\nWe need to see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this\nUh this is a bad false flag if it if it's a false flag it'll okay it really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent they didn't blow up any one but I Want to know\nWho they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping ... how many gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have um\nA few people that are well you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from an soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean\nWhat does happen today I mean like I said you can call it an inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced to rogue intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um sent the for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think it was an ex marine but yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military or is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy\nAnd this is where the false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nMaine and these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hospital government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with government plot to eliminate military generals or even political leadership now if you recall the rice and attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\n\nSo this is a tit for tat exercises his copycat exercise this is part of the final blow affect\nIt all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know and it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is is is Hillary Clinton said she said something the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow us our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there's going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens to the violence is happening\nAnd I still argue\nThat if if we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we would call it a civil war\nI mean think about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another and you've got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding where you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent to officials\nNow how are they able to do all the addresses of these officials were to send them and how to send them\nThere are a lot of give away is here to tell me that somebody is not very bright and that and looked at some of the ... the ... or or the bomb volosin if you want to [laughter]

headlines that are\nWell for example let me go here this is a headline I just got a mainstream media blames Trump Alex Jones pipe bomb false flag infowars mid term as it's like\nUh okay I Want to make some things clear and this is why I waited day usually went away to date because I don't want to go anywhere near Halloween with this nonsense I Want to do it on the same day but I always say this first and foremost local and federal for a local federal authorities here\nThey're investigating this now\nThey have not commented on who the bomb maker with bomb makers may be they don't know what their motives would be I mean we can guess what their motives are Trump condemned the X. today for the White House was not built for CNN no\nBut he did a\nBut the whole lack of evidence the whole mystery I mean there are holes in the script\nI agree but\nYou know the fringe voices on both ... both right and left make this a prime opportunity for misinformation\nAnd uh\nYou know eight Chen or on the Internet\nIt said that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stay just shooting at a rally or something like that and that there was some sort of political spent in the works up and even\nThough you see the media going after chewing on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones\nThere are a lot of liberal people too and they're they're just as quick to pin the blame on Republicans without knowing anything about the barbers identity or motives\nYou know I saw you own this GOP every last ugly I oughta but structure of our democracy you oh this this is insanity okay\nThe other person a Philly eh Philippe rhyme who is actually a Clinton advisor said\nPresident Trump visits argue this is all about you know think about the rice in attacks\n\nAnd know condemnation of the rights but even though President Trump was the target even with the generals were target\n\nThere's also some report of a bomb being sent to the White House there were no bumps into the White House\n\nCNN reported it and then of course CNN being the factual news organization they are\nWrong\nOkay and then of course governor pale and Sarah Palin she shared it wrong so I mean uh nothing happened at the home of the president it was all these democratic you know outspoken kick it when they're down ... they've got that stuff\nSo\nThis is the first and foremost thing that I Want to kind of cover as it should this is my job I guess to be a conspiracy analyst or misinformation buster okay these bumbling hopes\nThe bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get and then I Am I'm being\nKind of an an a and and I do some analysis I mean out of this year what you get is you get breaking news reports and we were ... we would prove it is with nine eleven nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kind of reiterate this you get breaking news reports\nWhich

about being attacked on the on the left\nThe continued attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic that is becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the republic\nAnd the intelligence linked to the resistance is usually get sympathy the truth is Democrats are not unique snowflakes they\nToo will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they wanted to perpetuate and conservatives will also\nSuffer\nThese attacks are happening to a lot more people in the Clintons the Obamas we need to wait to hell up and realize

regarding these vitally important issues since Nineteen Ninety five John Carmen welcome to ground zero\n[noise] good to be back ... are you doing today\nI'm doing great I just ah [noise] you know I run into a a a a ... I guess you could call it a quandary as kind of a confusion here because you know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA dare I say in an inside job but it inside job from the standpoint of who are the players within the intelligence community is responsible for this you know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not\nIt's it's an attack on the Republican we've had Republican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had a congressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of the force of responses you're getting her from the left\nFor educators they're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your flesh and you are the four runner and if you are the best of the information I've talked to\nAnd I'm telling you your head and so on line with this stuff that's all they're left to do is to try and you know for people to tell other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted his mother national magazines of a sudden usual this\nSchool year ring a bell yeah a friend of mine area where this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours they kill I say ... you know since the richest Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a copy edited anywhere all they're all yeah Danny capital narrow he he got killed I\nMean you did it on the legs this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working close with my crew for LAPD\nWho helped expose jobs go each of the CIA of the axis of the ... about\nThe cocaine in infiltrated the black communities where the ... freeway Ross left Iraq for [noise] and I knew area with\nI got a picture of me and Maxine Waters page on these two cars corruption dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really related fights side I'm Sorry there's big D right after each of those names right right right well\nWe'll just see we're just seeing how you know ... we had in the rye syntax just a just a little while ago and there wasn't that much commotion with the rice in the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or whole\nYeah yeah the um the uh miss is in my words you're the special theme races being this um [noise] the the and it wasn't actually the process is they're being you know the castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor bean is\nIn the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say ... but this goes back years so few fix the part of the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod does you sift through intelligence information you guys are on top of this stuff and that's that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions the Russian embassy or sixteenth street\nWhich is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah as as also outside the White House for five Seventy five Seventy six shorter and that's a phrase that was four and then\nSo are we safe to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was a somehow put together by a a number of aerobics I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep say 'cause that's kind of you know I mean it\nLeft wing left wing Democrat socialist or is this what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what eight extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like Maxine you know block to block that they'll let us do this create a crowd or you know why it riot also the ... that's ... that's a that's a felony and that's inciting riots\nWell do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately be seize upon Donald Trump you know Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this is why when she said well if you want civility you gotta put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't make the Senate there'll be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know who the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence or violence will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we give the equal opportunity to everybody that's inciting the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought obsessed with a very
