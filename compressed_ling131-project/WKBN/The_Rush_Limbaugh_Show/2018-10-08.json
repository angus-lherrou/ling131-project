me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of Iran's lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all [noise] some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters\nTo be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly\n... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the mid [laughter]\nI

away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating compounding\nCome pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nAnd this ... situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I

emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks that I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest\nThat this uh anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a Democrat voters is less than what we think it is\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixty and they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\n\nAnd when these are mad in saying this gusting Democrats protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise]\nBut for those that don't get it it amazes me but it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these

I Can't read but she says that a family show\nAnd then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs which just proves the theory to Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project or mental problems on to the public on the politics and exactly what is happening here\nDo not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration will make a point I really do believe that we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the American but there's no other way to explain this\nNow folks\nTo show you how to range and this is I have been the stack today I have a two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all but they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the\nFor the Democrats and much of it is I mean it just so wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this and it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and reacted them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearer ruse of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is a you know John Harris at political one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this pieces about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear ends handed to them every time because the ... the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have know got the Democrats are about your paper tigers Democrats or Republicans you\nKnow how many if you don't think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left I think that their side to budget was but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have sites that this woman wants to before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis grin now she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\nShe had a piece on Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night that they took over six says I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was

it's some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country\nTo pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly it's if it's relevance its power\nAnd it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason why why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in Atlanta rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that\nThat was forced on the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the\nPoint what they believe in the idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen they cannot withstand legislative tests it's the same\nReason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years you've Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you anything he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely\nSoft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or gets difficult task who's one of the aisle display in a left his district of New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you they're sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability\nTo to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey tried to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this\nIs going to lead to this giant gap in blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when big and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where

turban and number of them won't even take a call from would need a ... a member of their own party\nYeah but they said they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there because they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation
