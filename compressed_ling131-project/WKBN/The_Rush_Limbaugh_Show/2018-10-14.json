written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nThat's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of a wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said he had to tell his\nHis small team that there really is no police for political bickering work he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays for salary enough talk about politics here some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more on short about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens this week to determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open

uh just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a

of\nLimbo crash that killed twenty people in upstate New York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or loss\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nA accidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they\nGo to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and the center yourself and realize that you're not now but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting at Sundance and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion neurons in the brain for I'm In the past two that's why it's such a an interest in Cairo trust and an impact\nAnd thought that it mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive and when you know for instance if someone is on a CAT scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pat patients has to take notice fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress a negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nMeditate exercise ... a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas\nA trigger for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different you know 'cause it could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation um and also do a lot of self nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news\nNow be able to meditate go outside\nUm learned you know is a complete sentence with people because I don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining and\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nYou know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever you know the types of energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be paid around energy vampires I write about her destroying your energy\nRight we're speaking with Dr Judas oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York in which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on it\nAll this stress from other people's tragedy calls\nHimself long term harm\nOh definitely an empty

with a lot of success before\nYou lose your belt but we make a movie fitting will do well in the past because if you're going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version and again they bumped up a little too so the theory of sort of convention liberate the fight and um you know ended up working I prefer to prevent you\nKnow that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not\nReally making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing that was the last ... years maybe more than a decade now that that it was just got out of the remake band when we're seeing about course on television as well is that you know and I feel this way all

accumulated some others along the way and then you know like it was silly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make this\nA book [laughter] the the big lighter that's if if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams a and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum\nUm so it's

I'm Oscar ... and we're running down some of the top stories of the week [noise] don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter]\nThe most dramatic stories of the week was the story of the U.S astronaut and the Russian cosmonauts that had to make a dangerous ballistic re entry into the earth's atmosphere after their ... rocket failed they were on a mission to go to the international space station\nAnd two minutes into the flight or something happened one and the second stage of the boosters something failed and they had to abort mission and returned back\nThe only way we can get to the international space station right now is by using these Russian rockets the soil use\nRockets to get up there to cramped little thing they're old uh we're waiting for these new rockets to be able to take us up there from space acts and Boeing um and it's kind of a little below to this troubled Russian space program\nIt's the only thing that gets us up to the international space station so for more on this we turn to rod pile he's a space historian he's a science writer he's an author he knows everything you need to know about space and space exploration you can check out all his stuff it piled books dot com\nAnd we just started off by asking them for more details on this crazy story\nThis was a flight as you said one astronaut when us that's not one cause not go up the space station and they're in the Soyuz spacecraft which also writes up on a rocket at the same name\nThat was going up and they're supposed to swap out for a couple of crew members are already up the space station to we're going to come back now the space station always has a Soyuz capsule attached up there just in case so that's their get out of jail free card if they need to come home and an emergency but the official\nSeal of approval on that are coming home expires in mid December so they really needed this one to come up and swap out the crew\nOr not turned out it didn't\nSo apparently what happened is that it made it through about two minutes of flight ... staging first said the second stage and what I can tell and if you look at the video of it there's some kind of odd\nTo try this falling off the rocket looks almost like silver glitter from a distance I don't think that normally happens or are they doing but it's been a long time since I've looked at that tells me there might have been something going on with\nWhat are the engines but at any rate that's strictly conjecture what we do know is that something happened at staging either an engine failed to ignite or what I've read more recently is that the first stage to drop pre properly\nSo for one reason or another they had to abort\nOther rockets designed to be able to do that\nAnd they all have been since the early space age book on our side and the ... the Soviets except for our space shuttle which really didn't have an aboard option until much later than when you abort your ground control punches a big red button and a capsule let's go from the top of the rocket and fires a smaller set of rockets up above the capsule which are extremely\nPowerful and just burn for a few seconds if you're an astronaut inside that thing\nAnd you hit the aboard but it's like getting slammed with a block of concrete right in the face\nThey said they were forced to do a ... entry what exactly does that mean and because they said that during that stuff that they didn't have crewmembers can face a G forces ten times greater than that of a what's going on under\nIt's rarely more than eight but it's still a lot\nAnd even in a normal ... you're looking at maybe four or five but each one is significantly more so ballistic ridge remains ... this is what they did in the very early space age days back and mercury and\nBought stock on the Soviets I'd normally when a space capsule comes back in it glides a little bit it's almost like the space shuttle and away the shield is as items such a way and the and they use guidance rockets to ... themselves so that kind of glide back a little sideways not heat shield so it's kind of this Shiloh gradual reentry that gives you four to\nFive sometimes six cheese\nA ballistic originally just means you're gone up over the top of the arc that whatever speed you had goes away and then you come back straight down like a bullet and because you're not scrubbing off any of that energy by moving sideways you're generating a possibly nine cheese which is a lot\nThe U.S astronaut Nick hey it was his first mission what are riding with a crazy turn of events for him\nWhat a rotten afternoon huh and they showed some video the offense\nAnd at the point that whatever happened happened that started I guess the rock I started to vibrate significantly you can see these two guys in our hands are flapping around like they're trying to learn how to apply them and it's really it's almost comical but realize that\nIt was a top ride because normally that doesn't happen so they're really they said they were they were weightless at one point even before they hit the panic buttons cut out\nNo other way now these are rushing saw use spacecrafts generally they're pretty reliable as when I said I Know they've had a couple of problems here and there but can you comment on that and then also talk about the new fleet of things that are happening to SpaceX has a capsule getting ready Boeing has another one also what do we know about these\nSociety has has been flying since Nineteen sixty seven and its flown a hundred and forty five times so although that's actually not that many more than the shuttle it's been very successful they only had two crew losses back in the sixties and then after that it's had a few issues but generally it's been extremely reliable and it's been around long times\nWell the American health care association which is an organization that represents thousands\nOf for profit skilled nursing homes around the country and if you non profit to agree that the payment system needs to be restructured but they did push back against the steady methodologies saying that it was to narrow the population to be generalized the ball but the author of this study strongly disagreed with that claim\nAnd then if you have a family member that might be in a nursing home or something or you might suspect that some of this stuff is going on or they're getting too many treatments things like that what can you do to get a little more involved\nBut I Can't say that an opinion has published I received email responses with love wines concern for their family members care and also reporting instances where they feel that their family has faced I'm kind of trauma related to this issue\nIs kind of an on our own you know a family members they're being treated and you trust the people there so you don't know what's going on especially you know if you're not checking in every moment that you have so there's a level of trust there and reports like this come out and it gives you cause for concern\nMany experts that I spoke to from ... in the nursing industry and also with an advocacy group have said that there's a great or lack of information surrounding the payment profit thing and the treatment that these patients okay\nRiley Griffin reporter for Bloomberg News thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm Glad we're finally here this is my favorite story of the week we've all heard stories about passengers flying with ah their cats and dogs in some cases I don't know why this is so popular but they're miniature horses if people flying with their emotional support animals\nAnd you'll deliver is longer than that to peacocks hamsters a duck wearing a diaper I Wish I could have seen that deprecating pigs unfortunately the latest one in this line of emotional support animals is a lady flying with her pet squirrel or I'm Sorry her emotional support squirrel\nI'm I brought in my producer Miranda for more details on this just to find out how crazy to stories and we also talk about what steps you need to take to actually get cleared to have an emotional support animal\nThis woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight late Tuesday night when she tried to fly with her emotional support squirrels and then she refused to get off the plane after being told no according to the airline so frontier spokesperson made a statement and said that\nYes the passenger did follow protocol by calling them in advance and saying that she would be flying with an emotional support animal but she never specified that it would be anything other than the typical dog or cat right they had no idea that they were going to have a rodent on board\nThat seems like a failure of communication you would think the person handling the call would have asked well what is the animal they said rodents including squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights so if it seems to be some type of policy okay that could have been figure it out\nShe called in advance so he said the flight was traveling from Orlando to Cleveland\nThey told the lady you got to get off they actually had to take other passengers off the plane everybody how to get off so that they can be plain hurt they had to call the police forcibly remove her from the flight right and that in and of itself is a huge pain there is a fun facts I think you can share this rent a frontier airlines features a variety animals on the tails of its plant\nYeah so they're saying that they have animals on the tails of their planes including Fox either red Fox Rudy the raccoon Jim Bob the badger and even Oscar sent me the score of course\nThey did there was a viral video that was going on and the ladies actually they took her off in a wheelchair and she's lipic people off as she's being escorted out and people are cheering everything that we have a little bit of audio [noise]\nFrontier announce actually about a new policy on emotional support animals that are set to go in effect on November first and allows cats and dogs and restricts train service animals to cats dogs and miniature horses there it is again miniature horses seem to be a pot auto wanting the question then becomes how do people get emotional support animals\nI feel like you can just anybody can just say hey I Need this X. animal here to make me feel better it was actually a protocol that you need to go through to have an emotional support and well\nThere's a couple of things so emotional support animals are different from service animals and so emotional support animals are not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act meaning that businesses are not required to accommodate them\nSo things like airlines restaurants if you don't have the our service died because you're blind or you have a peanut allergy or whatever it is\nThey can kick you out of the restaurant and you're not out anything in order to obtain an emotional support animal you have to prove that you are emotionally disturbed you have to actually go to a mental health professional right and they have to diagnose you with whatever kind of mental\nIllness are mad motion on disability you may had and from there you can qualify to have the emotional animal to travel with you or go wherever you want and the only requirement is that they be well behaved and not jerks in public right don't have to have any kind of special training\nAll domesticated animals may qualify as an emotional support and cats dogs mice rabbits birds hedgehogs rats mini pigs ferrets the list goes on and on\nSo they can be any age can be happy it could be a kitten and it doesn't have to be a full grown\n... so this world could very well have qualified to be an emotional support animal I think she had it in some type of carrier and like it wasn't going to run around and cause a bunch of trouble\nBut less than adults that spokesperson said that they've had issues with these emotional support animals on fights including dog's having panic attacks needing to get oxygen administered to them the flight attendants being bitten by other support animals ducks just wandering the aisles blocking the beverage cards\nI Wonder if she did have a letter saying that it was an emotional support animal I Know a lot of people forge those things because they're pretty easy it's yes basically a doctor is now is what I\nMean there's even Web sites where you can go on line to let it yes or no questionnaire and print out your certificate sort of like becoming ordained to your friend's wedding\nThat's just ... it's a tough thing because\nRiding in a plane is a common space you're in tight quarters you got to share that space and be respectful of other people\nAnd you never know what's going to happen with an animal poop and pee all over the place I'm like I said I think the squirrel was probably not going to be that big of a problem but you know once the flight attendants are asking you to get off the plane it's already going to be a problem\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh man I just love that you know I'm not typically a nervous flier at all I Do get a little wary when you know the turbulence starts hitting but other than that I'm pretty solid when it comes to fly how 'bout you Miranda\nDepends on the people that I see at the gate [laughter] they're all just kind of chilling and looking at their phones I'll be good yeah but if there are a bunch of rowdy people or they're drunk already opposite\nAnd it'll cause that anxiety more you depending on how everybody else's so here's the important question Randy if you did get anxious what would your emotional support animal be and it can be a cat or dog has got to be a little ... something a little more exotic\nOkay cause might go to is I'm going to bring my dog I ... I would've\nBrought my own dog as well but you can't do that this is something in the line of a ... and hamsters can I have an emotional support turtle there you go that's a that's a good one they're quiet kinda cute and calm that's true that's my animal turtle\nI think my emotional support animal would be a slop [laughter] because they moved again they're quiet they don't get into too much action but I think that's why I think that'd be cute and something fun to the good conversation started Oh thank you Miranda thanks Jessica\n[noise] [noise]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily died every Monday through friday joined us on social media at daily diet of pot on\nTwitter and daily podcast and leave us a comment give us a rating tells a story that you're interested in\nAll of the daily diving I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineered by Tony sworn Tina\nI'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend edition [noise]\n\nABC News died just resident Trump's as you'll do something if it's learn the Saudi Arabia's involved in the disappearance of\nWashington Post columnist you milk a shaggy last seen going into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey over a week ago ABC's George Stephanopoulos\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump look white women have been voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a true\n\nFor a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as as started contacting all different categories for non\nOn white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents this and by the\nWay this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key\nTo American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana unimportant it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats\nAs your private refuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases\nAnd interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade has the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... ... s not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned to civility Christianity on\nFor listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the rights of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during\nVacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten run out of\nRestaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statement\nEvery Democrats just announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are this is the party by the way that has been railing against all doesn't civility for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a\nPoll of people who this approve of Democrat Party tactics and techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful of Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was saying look this is not working you guys you better get

times would print because they couldn't validate any other\nJane Mayer showed up at what was it the Atlantic\n... there was some kind of a convention or festival or some such thing New Yorker reporter James mayor suggested that in an interview that she ... Ronan Farrow\nReported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior mayor told\nElle magazine her recollection of the Thomas hearings as James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this the first story\nThat was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that was Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior when Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from balls the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people something happen just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern\nHere's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rush though but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping pond yes\nUh should have the ... app\nAnd pot [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments at a\nBase of liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound credit came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of nowhere either trending towards the middle ear barbarism off the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight uh with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party and grow what was it when that was all good and fine and dandy one word named them\nThink it was um before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what why are they what not when what why are they what were they light when the Democrats were in the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when\nYou know what purpose my point of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century in the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militants and violent socialism to achieve their means\nMy boy they're not\nThat different there just masking less today\nAlready know about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be met for news radio five Seventy\nCyber criminals cyber bad guy is going to attack your laptop your

political issue ABC is terrible Mary at the White House\nJust weeks before the midterms President Trump revealing he's not giving up on his zero tolerance immigration policy\nWell let's get at everything fell but you can look at it when it comes to illegal immigration\nIs out there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there and get your Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist is totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this during range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it wouldn't worry me to death that voters are going to think\nThat conservatism is made up of their range lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so I'm to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it\nThen the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly the ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the mid [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea\nWell we don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh more than a minute during the election\nIt is a interesting question though well any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's on the Democrats' side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to notice on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\nThey have been mad in saying crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election\nDay and the day after a two thousand sixteen then this cabinet situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now I\nMean they're still talking about investigating cabin offered her pulse he wants to see the F. B. I.\nDocuments released she wants a full fledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ... House Judiciary committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up\nAnd motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I think it's really been tried like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not folks I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it at a rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current make up which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large electing Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\nAnd when these are mad in saying this dusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise]\nBut for those that don't get it in amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party have large here's Jake Christian Adams writing is PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted in borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams writing I visited hospitals for the seriously mentally\nIll endless shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery whereas off and on earth way as anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning with dude\nAnd then the role was called and it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming in unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage was hate it was\nPoisons in Illinois they were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is\nIn the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the ...\nVery unfairly this is exactly\nWhat are the prosecutor wouldn't do and what fearless Republicans wanted to have done during the hearings\nHow'd you get home I don't

Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly\nActing on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nHe's Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aimed coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking\nAt those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't just\nTerms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand

him at every stop when he made his speech\nExcept for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering how long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump and draw up till

lose it well let me share with you a headline from political Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order Leming Democrat I guess this is according to the polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats\nNine seats with this this is a white by\nThe Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the\nDemocrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nIt can you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait\nTo go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide this dust\nWith the party now the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people in this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTo thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUm the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know no no officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched the said well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show",
