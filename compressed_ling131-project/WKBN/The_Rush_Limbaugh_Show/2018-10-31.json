there is there isn't anybody who knows who's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are\nAnd how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can breaking her way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling data the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ... nobody knows bottom line\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good where do you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those two elections\nWere Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that seat won the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that these intolerable\nSince that won election where he was unfathomable he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze\nThem he's never participated in a poke in the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nThat guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chance of Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the\nTemptation here to go ... and to become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump threat to end the or the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting them in countries that can't Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does mean\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America\nThe way it was founded in the snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent and they're not going to stop until they until they went another\nMahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak or does that would be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is it somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time that it's\nSo boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him of some kind or tried to or what have you all\nI Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say in the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically and tell these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have to leave that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it in his holding it and it's going to release it to the most opportune time\nSpite the factor in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because it didn't happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence and yet\nThey're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that\nHow many months maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure the Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\n\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen from never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides you're participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with smaller after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade of\nCelebrities brain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advised\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah we're told the old for is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democratic governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was was it was time to to to the Oprah\nYou think she was helpful why I Will admit that she didn't hurt me you think if Oprah hadn't been out there doing what the offer was doing it Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still won despite what the Oprah was hounded Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up anti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada\nIf Republicans hold the house did anybody cares about that other than the people say go get move it's going to motivate me to vote Republican\nAnd how many people on the Democrat oh my God we can't lose bathrooms oh no we can't have or move to Canada we got to vote Denver how many people think that\nThat's going to be the way people take their vote and yet it makes the news\nIt's a big deal that Barbara Streisand who nobody cares about might move to Canada how many Democrats over the years have threatened to leave the United states if they lose the next election and after they lose the next election\nOr to the United states in general just setting themselves up as the majority and they now wreak havoc and they get on an affair benefits and so forth and so on and so this this is the culture wars that we are in and this\nIs an aside poses a [noise]\nThat's why this stuff is all ...

[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN taken a couple of days or this or to reach the mainstream [noise] [laughter]\nNot on the line and ... on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs are afraid of says it was another have failed criminal just last week in can jockey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover ...\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threats in this country is white man how severe radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about him there is no travel ban on um [noise] you know they have a Muslim man there is no white guy bands\nNow John Lennon uh what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one on this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white man predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left in his white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here that is what we are up against and it's all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from the traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair\nThey continue to point to slavery as the primary\nEvidence to the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to and racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned [noise] racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly one has energized and feel of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is race I was gonna say racism and racial in ah in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and have been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using the victim allergy and victim according to a C\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it can be at right medic continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of deeply and notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left or the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for and I'm there as\nA result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump that you don't love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame there are people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you can not\nAnd on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people ... it's almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc Muslim Americans\n[laughter] or a general General David Dinkins where there are fifty four where are you parity yes indeed that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia\nCNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\n[noise] yeah where did it go down\nIn ... Taiwan rare but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there is no way to use that\nCrash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in\nAffecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just got to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went on\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN I was there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there\nAnd uh this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then they had a mystery where is the damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... certainly remember that Americans are protesting\nAgainst ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to\nWait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning was born in the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program it but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show them that many people especially it was a brand new planning that I don't\nKnow whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he says about what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be limited dumb or somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going on is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea salt in it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest um upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide\nBody and not\nAs widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they can they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... on it so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nRush Limbaugh because we know for you only the best school do on the ... the\nWe're looking forward to being with you again\nIn our house bedtime is complicated my wife is

of Democrats have been making racist statements and the drive by media is been ignoring them left and right [noise]\nDemocratic Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly\nIn a debate\nAgainst Mike Braun said our state director is Indian American does an amazing job our director of all constituent service she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job you can imagine\nYeah he's got all this diversity and has to remind but they do a good job nevertheless oh boy racist\nIs it was over we were in we were I mean we were headed for the gigantic blue way we're going to lose everything and\nThen the cabinet or thing happened in a caravan thing I might save the GOP there are other people saying well if it was going to save a GOP it didn't because all of that momentum was interrupted been a pipe bomber and the synagogue murders in Pittsburgh and that would have just destroyed any momentum\nI yeah I Love people in Washington and they're conventional wisdom okay so they are ... their businesses the News I'm going to explain this to you their business is the news\nThey eat it they live they breathe it they rang courage it tainted sales lemonade at they absorb it it's news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent and so they get all hot to trot about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they said that Kavanaugh situation the Democrats blew that sky high and sort of home\nMan this is really going to help them then the pipe bomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or\nEnergy level focus on those two things is interrupted by it and I think everybody else's has\nWell I don't know that it works like that with with with the people who are not in the news business\nBut I'm going to tell you it's been conventional wisdom and washing then that the pipe bombs and the Senate God shooting destroyed\nWhat ever Republican momentum there was an for whatever reasons\n\nAnd I just I I'm Sorry I don't buy it I think people can feel that in Washington\nIf your day is the news and your everyday you're talking about the caravan of you're talking about ... a cabin on the aftermath and the impact that that might have on the midterms in all of a sudden you stop talking about that because to other stories pop up then yeah you could if you're reporting and in the news\nMedia [noise]\nGet the impression that all of that in Russia and energy is lost but I think people in the news business and consumers of those are two different things and I really believe that people in the news business in all businesses are among the most detached\nFrom their customers consumers that any other business out there any other retail business I think the news business\nHas people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does\nDon't know if one I don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more\nOf their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit and that is is assuming an operating on the assumption that whenever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks for everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf the momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Ford miners\nYeah Ford my sounds of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that\nAll of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because of the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting and all\nWe have is polling data and yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate it showing missing the Trump comes out and gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but you know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know Kevin all of a such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rates serial rapists where is all it just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed and the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin all of us have been rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital of a stir it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if Woolsey Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses she\nWould have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made laying eyes to terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up you Republicans running for office have you ever been debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all\nDon't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kavanaugh or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nThis Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not to wait to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it\nThan this thing is amazing you'll I'm\nEssentially the way it works anyway we'll take a brief time out and

out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what's conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can\nI can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something odd um he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when that happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it\nJust totally came out of their sales in two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the electorate in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats the left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey ended up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll\nAnalyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long\nPiece in three words we know nothing on\nCertain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you're splitting the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat what two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded\nElections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here there's the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats in the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not just ... days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some racism good that the
