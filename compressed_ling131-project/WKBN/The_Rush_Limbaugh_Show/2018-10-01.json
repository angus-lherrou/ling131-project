S. M. C. A. as in the United states Mexico Canada agreement a new name for what was NAFTA the president says this one will benefit the American worker\nAnd many people as possible are made aware of this it had to\nKill the Washington Post or write about this headline Canada agrees to join trade accord with us in may call sending new NAFTA deal to Congress\n\nSo we're renegotiating NAFTA Canada Canada which then they want to know part of it they asked in the last moment hey don't forget us can we be why did this to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just me and the terrorists come said hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products and to the United states we're going to slap\nTariffs not remember\nHow to drive ... and the Democrats and the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke much icons it couldn't possibly be good at it might mean the end of whatever Rangel are making what the North Koreans it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on wide range of products China\nBut ... will cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the ... finance ministry yesterday\nAttract I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us this year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and\nZ and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see he\nHas rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one I thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that with Canada and Mexico and lost\nVast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour\nThe press maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions to tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers including farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned about none other than a dozen all of this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with\nUs [noise] [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking but\nBoth parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets it's a privilege for them\nTo do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come in now as I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nWe really we really haven't you know you can see evidence and science or that's what our own culture of the achieved any accomplish somehow people need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it\nAs some sort of new definition of humility rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making their country great we want to every country putting their country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point\nFor everybody to do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget\nWas ...

the Washington Post\nShe called at Washington Post tip line the New York times op ed published in the Washington Post all along where it's all she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kavanaugh's not just for a woman gets the Democratic party and the Democrats on this committee that have not heard of fruit as long as a ring or is\nIt and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low rider one would be Senator Feinstein and\nThe other what do you have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine balls before and it was a letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein as she sat there and a few while this was happening and I

background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presume to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your leaked this letter and like oh no I don't know what was it was the last she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like

the White House he started by talking about the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada Mexico and\nShe can offer no reason she doesn't even offer consistency there's even a little story this developed about the um her use of safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and that was new and the reason the the theory behind that\nIs mark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book\nIt was it was supposed to be a fictional book it was a it was a it was a an eight and ... and attempt to help him through his problems it was not a memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself at a Safeway where\nHe is Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here it it is\nDevastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she set in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea\nThat she was afraid to fly and yet here she is make ... all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans and not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to come and he was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she's the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically said to be credible every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so shaken by what happened all those\nYears ago you because it yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that I don't think for me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test well anyway back to Mark Penn fall very quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no

percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicates sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the

are you are here as part of the excellence by association [laughter] yeah\nI was thinking on that uh there is no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWe showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up and many germs are ... they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats and\nMotivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen\nBut again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready have been really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized they could get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up that deplorable evangelical may send a GOP based I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nWhat I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it and gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican doom\nThey can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh's those roots\nAnd what good is going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based\nAt a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved if\nRepublicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral and I want\nTo Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get ... confirmed to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not have it all gets through I think the whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nSo once again somebody else you can't blame 'em parks don't get mad at him because my original production was everywhere

questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we have one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of them are repression polls polls that are on very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be

certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about a misled I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in Lebanon pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not gonna vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI it was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing it is a lot of ... Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK\nThank you Mr solve it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks ago so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nSo now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nOr just tells ya if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read\nThey're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nOr let's say look let's

that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped\nUp here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for
