American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely\nDoesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they can portray themselves in Kavanaugh situation\nBut that's just the latest\nThe Democratic party has become the home of the mentally unstable\nWho have used the political system to\nFix whatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the purpose of government\nIt really is you take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with wife\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain inept incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government\nIs the solution and the solution is not really a solution the solution at the Democratic voters want is punishment

that the drive by have anything on them in Saudi Arabia is just to get Trump the cave period just just just to prove that they can manipulate intimidate Trump\nInto going against is ends things

find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker\nThese people survive on the image and reputation built by the drive by media but when the time comes to find out what really goes on between their ears you learn that it isn't much\nThey're frustrated because they've tried everything they tend to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed\nHe has thrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with fatal year\nThey have failed in every at tempt every effort to get\nDonald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go and gauge in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty four seven\n\nAnd the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was\nHow to drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of\nDonald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for removed from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a democratic\nBase and I mean that\nSpecifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not if they they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just\nSome of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Christine balls e\nForward that was a two for that was getting rid of cabinet as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero\nTo the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then towers in as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that\nWas after investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about\nThe shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democrat Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one how long did that story go on\nHow big a star or did they turn camera hog into and where is he now where is the issue of gun control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students in had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the on Iraq where\nIs that the day what [noise] but oh\nCamera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to life there he will be again\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's sitting under a long long he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal ... these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone\nBut nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women we want to see it in Albany saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience ... point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton was affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything

by me too movement\nI mean if the ... random bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women claiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good is the meat to move\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without the media\nFanning the flames or propping them up each and every day that as my precise point Trump doesn't need the media to be who he is Trump doesn't need the media to be elected President Trump doesn't need the media to remain popular\nOkay look

so uh but hey I got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one\nThing the Democrats won on and that's the end it as a Trump supporter every kind of the issue comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on how complex caved on\nAnd on this time just put an exclamation point on at the emphasize the Trump is winter that he says\nYou know that's an interesting thought uh\nThe the idea to flood the border to demonstrate to the Trump does not have the wall can still call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon ... do you think that would work\nIt's going to work on me let me tell you as as a Trump supporter that explain that aggravates me every time I Want to leave or one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing it burns me\nAre you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nYou know I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what you do on a it could be that he wants to do next year right before the election\nEverybody energized you know I don't know if he's just I all I can say that these are smarter than than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off\nA lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding zone with four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate that Trump pass a bill for wall the Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nAll I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't done that he has promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly right\nAnd right there that was for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally\nBut this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that leaders in both parties do not want that ball\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment\nThe swamp on that they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want the he's he is a a that he's come through and he's

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures so that's the one\nThing that has had legs okay so the audio salvage ship you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming through you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine\nOutcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been the rights\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe a pure objectivity is like this trust if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer uh Anton ... Julie ... they're talking to a famed Republicans strategic wrist ... about my comment\nFans deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into our scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't count votes like I Do I mean I rent a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats ... totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this just won a stuff and to me this is totally abs and um the Emmy Emmy what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers\nAre based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixteen I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible\nHillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a\nPrayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions is reality\nAnd as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop\nRejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done to one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage an anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have\nTo be what it is because the Democrats are not when the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no hauling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the fat edgy\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve ... who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so\nA reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by their gospel and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each\nAnd every I I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be\nOstracized after not too long I
