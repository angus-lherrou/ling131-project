that Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across\nSouthern may come out with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being done ... upset Trump's base that the\nImplication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a classic expression or illustration\nOf how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read all of these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave rush I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are student at the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that holds the white\nHouse in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are set up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump to know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking the job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called American dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook great in the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movements and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive by with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it is\nA problem\nThere's talk all over the winner of that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events\nThese falls surprises he calls them we call 'em October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bomb to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these calls and prizes and other events\nWyo intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans I'm holding the house\nAll of the above surprises\nThough it's a lot of Trump Trump's before when I don't I don't want to be part of the price we split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a truck posts and Trump supporters so that could end up being a net positive okay when we come back to the drive by media for not blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City bombing and\nNow me and others in conservative media being blamed for all of the rest of this today [noise]\n[noise]\n\nLimbaugh show on radio five Seventy WKBD and

order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing\nIllegal immigration and actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them in both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country overthrowing from the days of its founding out to the left America's\nIllegitimate it's immoral it's in decent because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country

service you gotta find\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd\nBack to the phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get rash I wanted to thank you for telling people about the true intent of section and one in a madman for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are on in the midst of oppression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... ... ... ... we're we're dealing with may I ask you education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what's pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Rick Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night the the sixty eight but another reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the threat to the limit that abolish slavery well\nThe southern states work though accept that so they pass laws are codes that were so restricted the blacks\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make a subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several states ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the votes coach or a polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the guys consider the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo at all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that I made this why you should\nDo this and that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of the people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo can for citizenship on people here illegally the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten chicken first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass emigration from the Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all those with emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in a ... in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... you know but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they'd be\nPart of American culture of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that [noise] we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard or immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been\nWe're talking about we're talking about the same thing that we have in this country for a uh companies that would like to locate in inner cities are poor areas they get a tax break for doing that\nThat was part of the Trump tax cut pretty smart idea I thought why not do that in Central America they would be maybe the United nations could finally do something useful and subsidized companies who want to locate there and hire people to do that kind of work\nWhat you're talking about the caravan you'd think that what you were going to stop illegal immigration\nI think it would have an effect on illegal immigration there are a lot of common sense things to do you know certainly the birthright citizenship thing going away it would help and the ... five but this is another thing that would certainly help providing jobs that they would be doing in this country possibly anyway low tech type manufacturing that's being done now in China\nThat could certainly be done down there I haven't heard anybody talking about that that's what kind of I was kinda surprised that uh that nobody in the Trump Administration has been mentioned that\n'cause I don't think that's what this is about NAFTA was supposed to do that and it failed royally are these people in the caravan are not looking\nFor jobs they're not looking for maybe ... maybe a few of them are but this whole thing is\nPolitical this is a political movement these people\nAre being paid somehow somebody's paying for all of this to happen\nUm\nThere are plenty of places to ... the only place that can go to the United states that can stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries [noise]\nAh well I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and if we had a far greater distribution of capitalism be fine and dandy but the Arab man I don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones\nIn El Salvador or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be done because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... we're\nNot going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world\nAnd otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know a wider George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nTo invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network

all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them whenever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we

Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there is a direct connection between political speech and violence that's a very serious thing to do\nThe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always

how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never

that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton rats always just one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I am your ... and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in the presumption up superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh that or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected when you think and what you say what you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless that's been golly it's can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of\nThing and it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that ... ...\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there seems to be tied\nYour is the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and\nNow you're blowing things up and you're shooting people just deeply darkly insulting it's not promoting civility it's not promoting unity\nAnd lying is perfectly fine if your gas lighting and especially the dog with because it says oh well that was what they use the word the the the dog

I Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that\nThe Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this starting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand\nMaybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level and\nThere's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana\nIs gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and this is the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA the synagogue shooting quality obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\n\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition split numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you if isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what's [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
