I Want to be a big part of the\nSinger songwriter I Want\nHow is the deed WKBD in Youngstown\n[noise] All right we are back and let's go to Barbara you're on the air are you there Barbara\n\nAll right Barbara go ahead okay can you hear me yes I ah\nI Wonder if I could turn a rhododendron sit there and lie like Bush is now with no harm\nOr you will lose the blooms on the ... the ah on the lilac and the rhododendron if you'd trim them now okay\nTime to trim on ms after they're done blooming in the spring because the bugs are set on the ... the uh the lilac and if you look at the runner Denver and it's one you'll be able to tell the easiest those sort of ball things at the top or the blooms on the road or done\nWell on that rather than during a we've got a big old part that comes up and I'd like to cut that completely out\nOh cut it out then the rest of the Bush\nNo it will not harm the rest of the Bush\nOkay and one last quick thing uh what can we do for peach tree to make it threat is a couple of years ago it had teachers all over and since then it's just been\nSickly or sickly in what\nWay and how tall is it hits probably about six seven feet tall and as far as thick late and it has some leaves but thank you\nCan get some fruit trees spikes and put it around them next spring and see if that helps at all [noise]\nAlright that'd be the best sickness and You're welcome have a great day and everybody else you do things for being with us and I'll talk to you next week Joe Daniel Day is up in just a few minutes\n[noise] went\nAnd hardware and software install guide him sing day these news radio\nFive Seventy don't they don't know [noise]\nI'm Brian Clark this is a horrible event ah\nWith not getting updates on the voice mail and whatnot I'm basically looking for another ... ... century length and I was wondering if you have any other routes to go maybe some other type of Internet based system\nA non ... do you want to separate from a from the person that actually provides your Internet service or do you want to is it more convenient to have one service provider you know doing both\nI don't have a preference I mean the Internet seems to be OK walked off the body it'll it'll it often back on um as far as the Internet you know you get high ... megabits per second but\nIt is the phone service with their voicemail and I'm not working I may not get messages to a day or two later [noise]\nAll right so so what they do is they they they have these third party services that you don't necessarily have to have your phone traffic you know immediately routed to them they don't have to like port your number to them or anything like that are so I'll just name one of them one were real familiar with a grasshopper I don't know if you've heard of them\nUm so basically what you would do is take your number three Time Warner and then you would put the call forwarding feature on and forward it to your grasshopper number\nWhich makes it to the grasshopper number now it grasshopper has its own voice mailing system messaging system extension system are prompting system and ... and whatnot so that call goes through their staff so bypasses that the the voice mail there and goes right in Internet now grasshoppers not the only game in town there hundreds of these third party\nUm that you don't have to attach physically to lie and you can just use your forwarding service they already have to send them off to the services\n[noise] oh okay I see that yeah that added cost\nThey would eat right so you you would want it you would want to take your ... you know the services that you have with spectrum and you wouldn't have limited down that so it's just the number\nSo you know you immediately forward to another service if they'll allow you to do that if not then you can pour the number directly over the grasshopper bypass spectrum altogether and then we'll or or yeah to bypass spectrum altogether and then the phone when it rings that goes right the grasshopper and then it gets distributed their\nPhone service or spectrum though right\nIf you poured it you wouldn't you'd actually killed\nThe the phone service and have grasshopper field the phone service or bondage field the phone service\nI Would just keep Internet respect correct yeah okay so you don't have you know\nYeah and and it's going to be required because you know you're ... you're on the phone call is actually going to still be coming over you know your your cable to bring a bite in reality the services being routed through of on edge or for through a grasshopper\nArt I check out All right You're welcome\nThanks Brent push it push it you being out there um and that and when we when we talk about the services that eventually become decentralized where we have you know you used to be you had a utility and your phone line came through one provider and then now literally anyone\nCan offer you services once you get a physical cable into your house so that's the important part of there's a there's a company that can physically run a piece of copper a piece of fiber keep a piece of\n... now you are connected to the Internet that's really all that ... is required\nUm you can go you know once you have spectrum in there you can get phone lines that come out of a you know little voice over I pie box that translates the Internet connection\nInto a voice on somebody makes a call it sends an Internet signal out to your voice over at the box the data's trance translated in that little voice of rugby box and then the phone rings and you get a phone call your voice\nIsn't traveling down a copper cable right it's\nBeing converted to data the data packets are being sent over the Internet just like anything else and when they arrive on the other side there being translated back and that so that's essentially you know we we benefit the marketplace benefits when we decentralized because then you literally have hundreds of people who who are\nAre are are vying for your business so the features the cost all of that\nYou know comes into play when there is not just one game in town so that's something I firmly believe that you know it seems in the middle in the beginning when you have this unlimited choice it gets confusing because you don't really know what you're choosing where if you think about it as this you know you you've now are responsible for everything you've got to do this in segments where one company is going to be your\nISP they're going to give you an Internet connection now for the sake of ease you might want to have your ISP also extend your your ah your TV and also extend your voice you know your your voice or your your phone service\nBut you don't have to you're not beholden to that and so they liked the bundle things together because most of you in this audience will take convenience over the features that\nPretty much every time so but if you if you're not if you're unhappy with how spectrums working um you know in the in this case in ... I guess my first order of business should have been you know ... spectrums voice mail service\nI don't hear a lot of that in the field so maybe giving them a chance to correct it you know maybe it's faulty equipment maybe it's a bad connection something like that I probably should've\nFirst said that I'm assuming that he's already been down that road if he's calling up to this point but you know it the voice over I P I there there's some\nWhen we see problems with voice voice of recipe it's because of a you know your ... your phone service has coming over your Internet and if your Internet isn't real great like there are certain areas of our of our city here\nThat just don't have very good physical physical connections and so Internet is not very good so if you're in one of those areas that have you know two megabits and you think you're going to jam voiceover I. P. service through there\nYou know you're going to be able to pull it off sometimes and then when you start using the Internet or on another machine or it gets you know jammed up uh your voice is going to suffer you're going to get you know disconnection it's going to cut out on you or some something like that there's going to have\nA problems in a perfect world you're going to be give an exclusive bandwidth to your voice over I P traffic okay so if you have one network\nAnd and I'll tell you how about a spectrum usually sets it up if you do it yourself you're going to have one network\nAnd then you're going to be responsible for giving your voice traffic priority over your data traffic they in in your router there's this thing called quality of service\nAnd you can specify that there's going to be certain types of traffic\nThat can be treated different than other types of traffic so but a spectrum comes in there they're going to give you one route or\nJust for your phones and one router for your Internet so really they are giving you two pieces of equipment so you don't have to mess with the quality of service if you've got Internet service\nAnd it's spotty you've got dedicated band with okay so in in in service or equipment I'd probably give the vendor of a shot at fixing that stuff first before you go and reinvent the wheel here because there's a lot of it I'm not going to call it liability but there's a lot of responsibility when it's on you\nRight because there's nowhere to nobody to call when you go shop a third party vendor and you have all these features and sometimes you have problems I mean ... spectrum will send a guy out to you grasshopper we'll talk to you on the phone there is a big difference between that especially if you're\nA you know early on in this stuff and you don't consider yourself very technically savvy so thanks for the phone call appreciate it glad you brought that up so we could talk a little bit about voice over I be\nA next we're going to go to Steve Steve you're on the computer show how can help you\nAnd my first my first wireless service with the yeah I thought this was years ago so I haven't I I had an eye on it you should well got everything I Need it and I haven't I and I thought now is not hold his church I mean I can charge it up\nAnd I take it in the eyes of apple apple quoting the price of new battery possible uh it's cheaper to get another one\nI Love anything about it and I I I'm not that you're savvy and you ... for my oh I I knew I find everything I have saved on it\nYeah you you could use a computer and I tune to transfer down to it took a computer and then when you get the new one you can transfer backup\nOkay so you take it off the I ... I took it yep and then back in ... exactly you are doubtful okay that makes it more [laughter] more skill to make sure that there you go\nSteve thank you very much appreciate it and and that's a routine that most of us go through every once in a while like most of us get you know the cloud backups and we hope that everything's synchronized up with the cloud\nA but having every once in while doing a a computer backup or you plug in your iPhone your eye pad your iPod or let I tunes grab all the data that's on their desk that in in case you do get you know hardware you hardware problems or you have to get a new device that easily transfers from\nYou know device to devise versus downloading it through the Internet door or any other way\nI'm so even if this scenario isn't the one that you're you guys are dealing with it it's probably a good routine in a good habit to get it because there's a lot of times where even though I had you know I could have rebuilt the\nBut the ICC loud backup right it was so much easier in faster just to go back to yesterday and it sometimes I'll I'll it'll create a backup by accident you know plug it into charge it in the morning just like last that I hate when ideas I hate\nWhen I plug in my phone\nWhen I'm half sleeping\nAnd it and it didn't really make contact and I wake up to a dead phone when it had eight hours or seven hours to charge be perfectly a hundred percent I wake up and it's all the way dead\nSo then I got to spend the morning routine getting enough charge you get me through the day is I don't have a dead phone but anyway uh so the ... ... sometimes I'll plug it into the computer because I was stupid the night before an accident and they get it back up when it was plugged into the computer because I have it automatically you know when it's tethered by a USB cable that it that it performs a you know a backup so\nYeah yeah the problem is I Need to get in there and get like ... on [laughter]\nYeah well the next time you open it it will try to run but you can cancel it and that'll give you the ability to to at least use the application before the updates starts on its own\nOkay you'll get I have a crack at it okay\nIf I if I Need to work it out for me and I do\nThat yeah for sure I'll give you the number I'll give everybody the number here in a minute and write it down and get something schedule with one of our guys\nOkay All right my problem is when I Do like a well okay [laughter] and and that got me I bought it in your\nRight right and you know do you pay for the the contract with the with into it do you pay like a service the every year\nLike that you get the new version every year yeah\nOkay so if you do they might be able to help you too so you might want to call their customer support and see if they can get you quicker than we can\nOkay\nBut I have not Monday we'll be able to take area okay All right All right thanks Cindy appreciate it and thank you for your number\nI sounds good okay that number if anybody needs something three three oh two five nine seven to seven eight or write that number down we both have commercial services in residential services\nAre so one of the first questions yet get asked when you call that number if this was for commercial or residential 'cause it's handled by two different companies in two different staffing us of its commercial\nMake sure you specify that and we'll get make sure that we get one of the commercial guys to feel bad out so three three oh two five nine seven to seven eight a and let the answering service no you're interested in having someone scheduled and then like I said first thing on Monday or will make sure that we get somebody on the case\nOkay so ah we're gonna we're gonna take a break a Pete I see you're out there we're going to make sure we take your calls when we get back\nOr if you want to call the show three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven where he can text me at three three ... three three three one five Seventy and when we come back we're and talk about algorithms after we talked to ... you're listening to the young south computer show on five Seventy WKBD and we'll be right back\n[noise]\nThe mayor of again build your average or every Friday Saturday and Sunday to reverse ... ball measure of you who voted for Gore Celeste right on it it can be ...

uh today's just chilled laid back day um I don't know I just feel really good and relaxed less stress\nIt's really good three three oh Seventy nine nine nine seven seven is the phone number if you want to text me it's three three ... three three three one five Seventy and I will read those text messages along the show today a and I will feel free at any time to jump in and talk and share some experiences really don't don't be afraid asking some questions that you think might be\nYou know a small time are are simple or whatever because I use I use what you say in and ask\nA to dig deeper so no matter who you are at what level or during this program I Hope that you can pick something up and and make use of it\nAnd we kind of all get smarter you know along the way so uh algorithms okay so you're you're gonna you're over the next ... you know if you haven't been heard about them or read articles about them in the news and whatnot and out of me tell you what an algorithm is because you're going to need to get familiar\nWith what it is it they're going to be you know algorithms are going to be vilified over the course of the rest of your life okay so um we're going to be granting companies the ability to use algorithms right because the algorithms are amazing right they they really do a good job but I'll give you an idea what an algorithm is\nThink of it as a as a crude form of artificial intelligence so we think of our artificial intelligence as a box that kind of knows how to govern itself know how to respond knows how to do stuff it has programmed\nOr you know intelligence that if it's complete it can learn but it's it's completely can do stuff well a basic version of that would be an algorithm\nAnd so let's just say you had a motion sensor in one of the rooms in your house so you walk in the light comes on you walk out the light goes off right so that censor performs a task\nNow we can make that more complicated by by putting a set of conditions on the light coming on or how long it comes on or things that it's capable of doing okay so if I Walk into a room and I've walked in there before okay so the conclusion is that the device or the the programming of the software\nCan make a guess that if you're walking in and out of a room you might be searching for something\nSo if you've walked in ten minutes ago\nAnd you walk back into the same room rather than waiting thirty seconds to turn the light out a way it's maybe Fifteen seconds\nTo uh to turn the light out so depending on not just a direct decision based on a single set of circumstances it starts to way other factors in there with what results that it can deliver it to you so when it's most simplified form a light can have do different things depending what data gets\nPut into it so if you walk into a room and\nIt's at four o'clock in the afternoon and your usually at work you can have the alarm goes off so it's the same sense er and it's the same light but based on a separate set of circumstances\nIt can deliver a different outcome and it's allowed to then way different conditions against a\nYou know a ... wherever you're doing so if you're if you're out of your GPS and it's on a weekend it might give you different directions on a weekend then it would on a weekday\nSo we're algorithm start to matter in our in our day to day life um is that you know there was a ... an hour especially in our digital life when we go on Facebook or social media\nOkay and I'm telling you using social media because there was an article this morning about Facebook\nNow you have to really really trust the people who write the algorithms\nFor the services that you use you have to really trust them and you have to really agree with them because they they wield an extraordinary Nate extraordinarily extraordinary amount of power\nBecause they write the formulas that gives you result they could and they don't share these algorithms with you they don't share the weights okay so let's just say I use this example this morning four thousand news articles came out overnight I read twenty five of them okay what decided\nTo deliver may twenty five articles that I Would be interested in that I knew that my you know my thirst for what was what happened overnight or you know was was clinched\nAnd uh I was able to say yeah I'm I'm caught up there's three thousand other articles that weren't delivered to me so who got to decide\nWhat was delivered and what wasn't delivered well you hope that it's intelligent where people are trying to serve you and your interests not serve you their interests right and that's why I said we have to really trust the people were providing so what if they don't like pepperoni pizza\nOkay because they don't like pepperoni pizza they wait pepperoni pizza like really download the the list\nSo you will never be delivered a coupon for pepperoni pizza and now she's pizza absolutely you'll get coupons all the time because you buy pizza and you like coupons so they'll delivered but because they have a bias against a certain something they can take and\nBehind the scenes without ever knowing because really what you what you're not delivered is never you're never shown that\nRight it's behind the scenes\nSo you won't only notice it\nAnd unless it's it's really ... you know like off the charts dramatic like if you get a dramatic shift and say hey you know what I haven't seen\nYou know half my friends on on Facebook I Wonder what happened to them and it's because an algorithm hinge you conversations for people who you weren't engaging with so then you go and gauge with a couple of people and report respond a couple of their their posts and you see they start playing populated ah on on your your feet again that's that's the\nWhich means there's no option to recover that violent and the other way\nRight once it's deleted it in the in the operating systems allowed to read that space of a file comes along and uses partial of that than if you can't assemble anything and it's damage beyond recovery\nDo the good news is my wife can't use any of our credit cards on line and\nThere you go all rights as an optimistic view [noise]\nAll right well I just take a shot thanks so much enjoy your program\nI think Matt ... being out there and and so you know you walk in in ... case I mean you can maybe try and another program and maybe it's a little bit more thorough but\nHe I mean unless you're a super desperate I think that first program is going to tell you all you needed now now the one that I use is I think it's called I sky soft a tool box and it's a it's a recovery program same same as what he was using it's sixty dollars um and it uh\nIt does the same thing where it can go back into something that's been deleted or you know I've had phones that we've totally restored and we can grab some data here and some data they're\nA very important and uh if you can go back in time or you would go and turned on the ... I called back up right unimportant things and every once in a while you plug it in the IT and so you can have a copy even if it's an old copy especially in in in this case\nUh you would have gladly taken an old copy of your password listened set of a new copy of your password list All right let's take next call let's go to Joe next Joe you're on the computer show how can help you\nOr you're just a general question about routers how do you change the password you type in a a a an IP address in your browser to access the router most\nOf the time so either you up to two kinds of routers\nThree ... so that the one kind of router you plug it into your network and then it's usually like one Ninety One six day one ... one or one onto one six eight zero doubt one and then when you point your browser at that I pay address you get a little user interface that allows you to log into the configuration file and set up he addresses\nThe second one requires a controller um so unify is a company that uses controllers where you actually loads and software on a computer and the computer looks around your network and then grabs the configuration files from the hardware so you actually change it in the computer and then the computer sends a configuration to all of the devices\nAnd then the third is governed by sort of like a an app on your phone so Google has their mess why fi and so it scans your network and it can figures in via phone to one of those three ways to get into your router\nOkay my daughter got a new neck your router and ah I don't think she changed the password I think there's just whatever came with a thing right\nNet gears are definitely ones that you just put the IP address in the um in in the browser and the URL for the browser and then you get into the configuration\nOkay very good now I noticed just driving around the neighborhood of my little a tablet or a lot of\nA a a white wrote her a\nSignal show up and a number of ... we'll just have the uh the manufactures a model number as a user name it'll show the thing is walk because you can't access it I'm going to guess it\n... and those cases those people have not gone in and and made any changes and it probably use the generic password what do you think\nYeah and if you don't if you know the ss ID I'm ... is what broadcast and then you have to if it has a lock on it you still have to give them a password\nMost of them will make like a random one that ships with it so chances are you're still pretty safe if you just use the one that came with it but I'm One of those people that I've changed their society and the pastor right off the get go 'cause I don't want someone to be able to come over look at a sticker and without me giving the password so I'm I'm with you that I'm change in that soccer\nYeah real good All right thanks show thank you for the phone call appreciate it\nAppreciate you being out there and we are going to do a whole segment on on ... coming up after this this next set of breaks are so if you are you know you have a router that's more than five years old you're going to have to listen up to this because it's going to be good stuff you're going to put together a plan for getting why nice and dependable and fast and high performing\nA Internet in your house oh listen up even if you got it right now if it's five years old you're you're probably due to have it replaced Larry I see you're out there will make sure we take your calls as we get back from this break through three of Seventy nine nine nine seven seven or three three three one five Seventy this is the computer show on five Seventy WPN we'll be right back [noise]\n...\nFrom America's Best selling automobile two worlds toughest trucks there's a reason why customers are driving from Youngstown boardman Austin Town Armitage even Cleveland Pittsburgh so come and find out for yourself in our own new state of the art facility on route forty six see you at Toyota worn [noise]\nAll right\nWell come back everybody this is the young sound computer show I'm Danny ... computer and we get to do this on Saturday talk about things that are happening attack open the phone lines to you and let let the conversation begin so three three oh Seventy nine nine nine seven someone's going to Gary right off the ... or ...

XML a links I'll see if I can find it over the next break and if I if I can I'll I'll make sure I mentioned it\nOK I'm like right now I'm looking at our website and it's getting what they want to create one one for that's what I Would me correct\nNot necessarily because you're looking at the path to the page it might be imbedded in a different part of the page so you'd have to see the the player the path that it's using so if you take that IP address and you plug it into a browser and you get a stream like ... and so you still see put that in there and see if you can stream from that link\nThan you are right you got the right at the address but I don't think it's going to be that simple with the uh five Seventy ... page I'll look into it I think that I can find very much Joe You're welcome thanks for the phone call appreciate it\nAnd and just so you know in in for for the rest of us here basically how that works is that every stream sort of has a home right and you if I wanted you to be able to hear my stream I Would put a little player something that's capable of playing audio over a website and I tell my player\nWhere the stream sources and it's a long string of you know a a of data that might stay the same and might be different so we use re streamed on Iowa it's a it's a streaming service and uh my dream\nPretty much stays the same from the broadcast but\nIt does in from the source so you couldn't put my streaming there you'd have to use it at one of my sources go to face that go to YouTube or go to pod cast in order to get it\nThere is no active link that you can just drop into that source to play it all depends on how it's being broadcast is how you can pull it into a one of your devices so thanks for that phone call appreciate it\nOr we're going to take another break Gina I see out there we'll ... we'll take your calls as soon as we get back from this break a and we've got some text messages that came in will make sure that we read those too so three three\nOh Seventy nine nine nine seven seven and we also got three three three one five Seventy is the text messaging line and we're talking about some wife ... fine regular wife by so stay tuned you're listening to the young south computer show on five Seventy W ...\n[noise]\n\nTime in two o'clock and ... going up there and brothers dot com is news radio five seven WKBD in young south [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Brian Clark early voting for mid term elections begins today in Nevada [laughter]\nAnd that would have been a better word to use the thank you very much I I use them and a lot when you know but we have our morning meetings about or it's one of my favorites I don't know why because I guess it gets a reaction because it's so gross\nA and so it became one of my favorites a speed is definitely a better word so thank you for that suggestion or what are your thoughts about using Google Voice to run to phone numbers on one device are there any other services to perform better or worse for this activity thank you\nOkay so Google Voice I'm Google has these little experimental services where they'll they'll get in to do to an industry and they'll make some really good software and their offer some you know unbelievable free products that are that they don't really advertise as themselves doing so\nMany years ago I mean it's got to be every bit of six or seven years ago they created voice dot Google dot com Google Voice\nAnd what they they bought up blocks of numbers and uh and they offered them with huge email account that you can get a Google Voice account\nAnd it works is this virtual phone number virtual text messaging for virtual of voice mail system which totally managed by your your Gmail account and all you really have to do to qualify for one of these phone numbers is have a valid or you know Gmail account\nAnd so you can grab a phone number and connected to your Gmail account\nAnd then once you have your number that you use you give people that number you can have a do stuff like\nYou know click text messaging and forward messages and for the phone calls to any number if you'd like so we use it a lot like when we have to do\nA you know we run an ad and we don't necessarily want to give our normal number away 'cause we want a segment out where these people came from a Google Voice numbers amazing because you can track the numbers that came in but they still end up on your regular phones right\nAnd so it's a way to segment that out and it's free so I mean of course you're going to use a ... a service like that\nIn those experimental world because it's absolutely free uh so the question is that using these to connect to devices now I'll I'll tell you this I connected to Google Voice number two my Alexa devise\nA Amazon Echo and I also connected to a um a Google Pixel phone I've\nNever tried to connect it to any legitimate phone systems it's always been a cellular device or you know a a an Amazon Echo so I ... I Can't make a recommendation I'd really that would be really cool if you had a you know a voice over I pay phones that connects to the Internet and then you just send a Google number that would be you know amazing\nAh 'cause the free number so if it takes me back and let me know if that's what you're asking if you know of a piece of hardware\nThat will take a Google Voice number 'cause I'd be super interested in uh in previewing that as part of the next hardware that we uh we take a look at it and and you know on box and whatnot so interesting but you should be able to there's nothing stopping you from plugging a you know a phone into the Internet\nSending you know of America dress or connecting that phone to your phone number and then when that phone rings that device goes I mean there's there's nothing different between that and something you'd get from ... and so it should be entirely possible I Hope that answers your question so\nAh three three o seven to nine nine nine seven cents talk a little bit about mesh wireless and uh and so\nI mean it's split these two technologies they're using the same stuff but they're done differently\nOkay so you have your traditional wireless that has antennas right you know the ... Time Warner spectrum or a TNT we'll put a little box and that that your router and your modem and they have little antennas off of it that will broadcast a signal\nAnd that's all you need wall in one box that handles your wireless and you're also you're you know your your routing and modem or responsibilities so what you were in those cases\nYou know you put in central and the house you have them run it to you know in the office and then that broadcast does fairly well and you maybe ... need to run a couple of range extenders to extend the capabilities of wireless\nUm but for most of us we have one little device that centralized and that's really all that we need now when you're when you're Internet search getting to be intensive where you're you know we started using sling t._v. for our our television services so we needed to bump up our Internet speeds\nAnd I couldn't run wiring didn't want to run wiring to every ... room in the house so that I didn't run out of the house has to have ethernet cable running around I just thought we should be able to accomplish this with wireless but the dedicated wireless is what's needed where you have to have\nGood solid Internet or else you get buffer ring on your TVs and nobody will put up with that nobody's going to cut the cable to watch some TV and in the middle of a football game get buffer nobody's going to do it so uh the wireless has to be pretty solid more than just a\nI'm a you know a little wired antenna router can provide it's just it's meant to be like the shotgun of\nOf ah of wireless where it gets the job done it spreads it sporadically and you know and and it usually accomplishes normal Internet feats but when you need something solid you get up that game\nNow the second thing that after ... ... what came out next was ... wireless okay so\nIf you um if you're familiar with how cellular telephone systems work you drive around and you're connected to antennas as you move around you're handed off to other antenna so the antennas no we're each other are\nAnd they know where you are in relation to them and when you start moving far away from one it seems that you're moving closer to another and an hands off your data connection to the other end tests now\nEarly on and ... even this system didn't work all that great when you start it didn't pass those off you take it dropped calls between towers especially between different manufacturers are different service providers and so\nUm you know mess works on the same principle that as you wander around your house with a device you you get past from access point to access point because really how wireless should be done is it you should have smaller um you know smaller devices that don't broadcast\nQuite as far as they're not designed to go as far\nBut you put the density of access points closer together so you have a little bit more overlap so you need more of them okay so we started using unify routers and access points where the router kind of had all the important stuff in it and the controller had the important stuff in and these access points were were relatively cheap I mean they were\nCome back to some more of your phone calls
