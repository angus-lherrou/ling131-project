[noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it it's\nFairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or the Democrats blue wave is drying up oh that's how it would be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eighth teen mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely tilt Democrat and it's in line with the twenty tend to Republican members around now\nYet yet we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic wave would if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling and people have been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots\nThat shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen while it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot the lemon name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think could result is going to be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggest for Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the ... Senate that would require due to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other state that they have\nBeen held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nLet me go state by state the show where this is all happening and ... the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this was a\nTraditional gear party out of power winds ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls which say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see won a close race to some of the could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's\nBiggest serial killer\nNow ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the want the murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion\nThought of and categorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi an hot\nAir was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you\nGet a distributed and how do you find the theaters that will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ...\nAnd they got it done and the way they got this done this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula it doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie\nHas a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and\nViolence in the movie and it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the room\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about what\nHe did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the left\nAbortion is not even human it's vital tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest role that he's played\nFor the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to states PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not gonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story about the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a\nLot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy or directing\nThe film [noise] ah [noise] [noise]\nI ... I it it it's it's powerfully done and it opens tonight and if if you don't know about ... now if you've not heard the name of it doesn't ring a bell you by all means should see this if you do know who guys mail is and if you think you know the story\nIs attempting here to blame Donald Trump Donald Trump and his and criticism of the media\nIs to have made Mohammed comfortable with the fact that you can get away with murder rape turtles because Donald Trump lady think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now\nBeginning district ... this is just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding ... don't be surprised if\nIt starts blowing up\nFrom this point forward right\nNow [noise] [noise]\n\nOn radio five Seventy seven UK be and it's two thirty\n[noise]\nMe in the valley good afternoon I'm Cathy gay that's one of the people indicted Thursday in hot trafficking ring debates in Austin and if you can't believe these bats yet [noise] the grand jury says Elaine how men use your position as a police dispatcher to help\nOur son of contact with police Hammond San which also indicted\nNineteen year old Jacob ... will be sentenced today for the brutal murder of his neighbor Ninety four year old marine about Castro at her home in ... the ... comic scene at the time that murder prosecutors wanted sentenced to life without parole\nWashington D.
