because Obama was hip they didn't care because Obama was cool they didn't care because Obama was wiping out the Republicans except the one Obama\nWas enabling the Republicans wipe out the Democrats as we discussed in great detail yesterday\nAnd ... came to me today he said you know what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show he said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how ... died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it is apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware they were using the watch as that Central Asia at an element of\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I had to consider\nIt has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal casualties watch could have recorded anything can happen to women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession in his fiance in a car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so on the last ... had entered the password for the consulate why why network on his watch which I Know he didn't do\nBecause most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know that watch will work on why five\nMost people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife I network like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone that the watch can access that I find that work

he said well you should be aware because they're mad after [noise]\nNobody's supposed that they they say the show was recorded the events of have to record on watching their base will say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] neither headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm a\nDemocrat National Committee cheating and election ringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right so see I got rid of Fox willingly\nOpen our mid to late ... had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in ... bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nI don't scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point\nThe impact of the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats\nAnd the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nSo the media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nRock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunning shocked where is Bert rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here started campaigning as if this blue wave weren't\nA deadlock if the blue waiver while you start to me [noise] oh yeah I got a couple a couple of stories Democrats those are the worst Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama's not going to GO Campaign and the situation because of the blue wave is not a lock and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it\nDo you want a third term of mud ... if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened did\nAnd all this Trump was it a match it late at night Hillary Rodham running them and\nSo he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two three stories here on this on this dissipating blue waving Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\nSo the AP pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why\nTrump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about it\n\nHere's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview the wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those\nYou know they're always a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses or view of the outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline\nTrump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three two one\nHey Pete reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that have no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor many many races and I will say\nThat we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points\nOh it's that simple he's the only way he get his message out he's not going to stop he loves it and the fact that they're getting frustrated the CNN News media media whatever\nGuys they didn't do much talking residents just didn't feel much media this much he's gotta he's gotta stop promoting the country and so they're so frustrated they

we\nAre idiots\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces intensify and pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on 'em Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on them every attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought\nAll along the mother is going to get the goods on how Trump's Foley election by shooting in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ball game for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump jaded with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise I mean it's it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing or if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media\nRather\nThan break the rules and released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrapped it up while it was a big mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking about before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed out there the ill educated under educated on it\nEducated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port handles\nDisaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when low it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made\nPublic so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Mahler not include the investor you protect\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven anyway he um [noise] I became\nA a Trump supporter one reason was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair\nAnd my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only myself he put in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can ever remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well and that shocked you write\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration in the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea they newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up what am I ever seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can to hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say you\nShould probably be met for on friday and [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance mostly were larger I Want you to get a PIN and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred

who can vote on all wrong\nOn demand in your home ... your sample ballot provide that information from Montgomery County board of elections [noise]\nHow honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or\nTheresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is\nVery serious take them very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there\nObviously have to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never I had a little\nTaste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists in these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs latte if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about\nThat and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved\nTo adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day and I was Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's\nAll about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them anything for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most they pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life to him\nEverybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship ... not to me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ...

there were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer immediate not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over and over\nTrump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo my career he would've had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply\nReminded everybody and real

judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn warrior who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump dead\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had done to her\nIn fact she had been found guilty the judge\nIt through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the prostitute

think\nSome pull quotes as a matter of fact Trump's approval rating is now hire a van or tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure\nBut the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved or the job he was doing and that was after\nThe failed pork you it was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if\nTrump so who actually is being divisive trumpet\nThe GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does\nI have to think that the drive buys are fully\nAware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than
