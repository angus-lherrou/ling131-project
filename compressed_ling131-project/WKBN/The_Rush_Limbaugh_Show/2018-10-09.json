but I'm Sorry\nThis is so full of it let's go back to the top of his son ... on the issue is that our lives have wanted to see Trump be tough on in particular Russia because that's the one that he

blaming the divide that exist in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand about this country surviving as founded we're under assault it has never been worse\nOr they made of the civil war but but those were different circumstances oh that was a specific arguments\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery but in the end nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America as\nMount some people's sense it\nSome people are not aware of it and I I've I've uh just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and it may be present some\nSolutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that\nWe face are still that's coming up as the program on falls back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\n\nApologizing to Kevin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd they have an episode codified is exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how good braved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born a and so each of history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my\nThoughts [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\n\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even a worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nThat they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in a capital hearings everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on

look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm On these people are thinking everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked in America in the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill\nAnd Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be in until somebody in the Democratic party cried this\nTrump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in and would always say a\nVariation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside the couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even\nIf the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again\nUm anything they can come and they are all so certain and they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on the when they're all ready planning to impeach capital\nAnd Trump and the fat doesn't happen I don't think\nI

the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either calmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred and Eighteen needed to win control\nThis is what you were just telling the rights and you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true some I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is\nOkay so when it goes says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine feet\nFirmly or do we mean Democrats I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you would need for\nThe majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo seats are waiting I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats ... ... this this is why\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\n... this is what they believe it now\nLooks I don't have any inside the information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling you know I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people watching it live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or new meaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election\nNight two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and you're asked you'll be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the SVU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand for the first order and\nYou know officer you know\nOur government is separating the two parents that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched and said well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nAll the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house and

remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John\nTower I knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a

George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says John Tower\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab\nThat John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out but\nSally Quinn didn't than Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically I tried to soften the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and I was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was a general and the army at the time\nAnd the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think than tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot in God\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I Would absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she is there another one here yeah there's one more by we got Times Square here here's another reason why\nNumber
