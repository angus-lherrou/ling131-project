{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Oh maybe three feet\nOkay yeah that will not her to do that that is fine yes\nOkay that's the first question and I had oriental graph which growing like crazy I liked it down 'cause I got that down here yes okay how can I had all the way down like Eighteen Inches from the ground\nBy you can cut it all the way to the\nGround and it will come back yeah it does it have plumes on it\nRight now yes\nOkay I'm a lot of people don't cut it down this time of year 'cause they liked the plumes I don't know what type yours is\nBut I don't know what it is either\nYeah you can cut it down this time of year it doesn't matter some people leave it until spring and cut it down then other people cut it down this time of year because they're tired of it and they want to get it out of there before winter hits in the snow does all kinds of things to it so you\nCan do that but I was thinking yeah cut it down now I saw actually\nNow that it's very very why and I had it in ... in a flower ugly you know in one eye and it's a you know part of the bottom out what the shuttle\nYeah you can divide it right now like yeah I can do that now\nYou can do that now also yeah just solid and a half or however you want to do it it's hard to do you got to\nReally jump on top of it [laughter]\nAnd I thank goodness I mean one yeah\nYeah I Know it's hard to get maybe could I had it down now and that may be in the spring\nThat sure yeah spring would work also as long as you remember right number okay very good thank you You're welcome them like All right thanks for the call okay\nYeah ornamental grasses are one of those things um cut them down spring or fall the taller ones that are six eight ten feet\nLot of times if you don't cut them down in the fall you know the snow gets on them they get all Rowley and smashed over it sometimes easier to cut them in the fall of the smaller ones go fall or spring\nOn that with some then dividing a lotta times every three to four years it does help to divide them then you have to either try to give the divisions away or throw them away or whatever on\nThere so uh we have one caller left on the line and he we will catch him\nOr her whichever it is after the break a will be going to break in another thirty seconds here so again ornamental grass is a great thing because they're very low maintenance you just cut 'em every year and they come back every year and\nThey have a lot of the ... type foliage or the seed heads whatever you want to call him on top of great way to go on and mental grasses are rate thing they have a lot with the green\nAnd white even some of the yellow on them so they have more than just a green foliage there's some low ones with the blue foliage just a lot of fun\nOn 'em so Joan you are first\nAfter the break we'll get you will be back this is a plant care show I'm Phil Steiner Joe Daniel Day is on for one hour from one to two o'clock we'll be back shortly\n[noise]\n\nShe says she [noise] Bruce Bruce from [noise]\nCopy\nAsian Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trades and while dot com or call eight eight eight\nIs use radio five Seventy doubled you Katie in Youngstown\nAll right we are back and Joan what can I Do for you\nYeah I knew a knockout rather I've been told that I Need to cut come back after a first for our\nOur ... are they still blooming still remain beautiful good well don't cut them back okay if\nThey're blooming enjoy the blooms as long as you can okay which could be into December\nOh okay uh-huh\nSo my roses often will bloom\nInto December through November through Thanksgiving\nA lot depends on the weather so you\nDon't want to cut them back while they're blooming because you want to enjoy the blooms okay so let 'em go I normally tell people with roses might cut back data's December tenth now if they stopped blooming before that then you can cut them back before that\nOkay but then how do we\nGet like cut back\nI normally cut them back to about Eighteen Inches from the ground\nOkay how tall are yours three to four feet mhm yeah so [laughter] yeah\nEighteen Inches from the ground as what I cut them back to and then depending on our winter is because sometimes we fat and knock out roses get some die back over the winter and you might have to do some pruning then also in the springtime\nYou know just maintenance pruning than let them go from there in the spring and you may not have to do any printing in the spring or you might have to do a little bit to adjust them in the spring but they should be ready to go and how long have you had on this the first year\nYeah and fertilizer fertilize them next spring as soon as you see some new growth coming get some like a spy on my rose fertilizer which is a granular and sprinkle it around them okay and enjoying them next year\nOkay as long as they're growing and really I mean let them go\nRight don't cut them off it they're blooming girl\nOkay [noise] um but the winner will not killed them and if I mean could prove them fight December and all the snow and everything well not kill them\nIt normally does not kill them if they're healthy yeah we've had some tough winters were some have died but they normally survived the winters they are hardy roses around here yes\nSo what about if if it's a hard winter which I hear it's going to\nWait till spring time no\nPrint on this phone matter what side of the house are they on\nTheir on the ... uh let's see you're on the north side of the house\nThey would be I'll tell you that's the worst side but that's OK you could get some will proof who knows\nI I'm Sorry they're on the west side of\nThe that's the second worst side [laughter] you can spray on with will prove after you\nPrint them it's a spray the you can get it most garden centers\nAnd spraying with well proof which will help pull the moisture in the rose bushes and that will help them survive if we do have a really hard winter okay we'll we'll W. I. L. T. O. okay we'll ... free okay right okay thank you Joan appreciated okay\nThank you very much parade everybody have a great weekend we'll talk to you next weekend ... ... and Joe Daniel Day is up next week long\nShot married brothers find hardware and software install guidance ship same day this is news radio\nFive Seventy WCBS [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nAndrew Brunson an evangelical American pastor who had been detained in Turkey for nearly two years back on American soil Albert just do during our one of his first steps will be the oval office visit with President Trump roasted was convicted by Turkish quarter accused him of spying and aiding terrorists\nWell the physicist is going to say well the Adam the electron on an Adam is in all places right so we're looking at it and we see that the nucleus and we have to do these things flying around and and the things flying around her in a space right well in in\nThat space when we look at that single film strip it's in one little segment but that electron is it is really a cloud it's a it's a piece of an Adam that this electron isn't all possible places all the time and that's okay so you're following me right\nAh and then you think about the universe that large it's made up of lots of empty space\nWell if you take my film strips thing analogy and if you have all the things that are in motion and they are occupying all possible space with in the universe than it has less empty space only when we observe it looks like it has lots of empty space 'cause we're looking at it through\nA snap shot of time right and that's why this is all leading up to why time and it has an is an illusion\nOr because you have to sort of you have to lend credibility to the fact that okay so let's let's do ... you\nCan't just say the time is an illusion you have to have this stuff to give you a purpose or reason why a you know time is a lot of what is an illusion so\nAh so you ... you know you ... a lot of what you know about Einstein is that he had a you know relativity is is sort of like the premise for every you know the his big experiments right\nAnd so basically comparing to objects okay making something relative to another object so we don't have a real understanding of what that is normal people\nBut so when you compare to things okay so you are a having a ... you're in a car right and you're traveling at a speed relative to something that is not moving right so that's easy to do you can take a speed\nNow you can make it complicated a little bit now you can take another car traveling at a different speed parallel to you and now you're traveling relative to the other car and you're traveling relative to the road to different objects now your speed is relative to the things that are around you so you might be going five miles an hour\nOr ... according to the to the the car that you're you're\nDriving parallel with so you see him and when you observe him your traveling five miles an hour or so when you're on the freeway and everybody's doing sixty and you're doing sixty five you're traveling five miles an hour relative to the cars that are not traveling sixty five miles an hour so you get it that's the real thing we're comparing objects that are both stationary and moving around you\nWell the thing is we live in our universe that everything is moving so when we're making calculations of stuff we're making calculations based on movable objects okay and our snapshot\nWe really don't know the scale of what snapshot we're looking at we don't know if\nOur world is really the super fast world or our world is the really super slow world but it's all relative to other worlds that\nAre that are that are out there so you know if if you have an aunt\nThat lives for six days\nRelative to us you like that and that's really suck it he only got to live for six days\nBut in his world six days was a an entire lifetime and if you take it and make a comparable to what we live it's the same he didn't leave a shorter longer life just relative to our life so that's the relativity thing when you start talking about this comparison when it comes to the universe in time\nYou know ... ... ... that starts to matter\nA because we lose sight of you know what our constants are well the constants are there are no confidence it's all relative and so that you have to build everything upon that relativity well his his thought experiments had a lot to do with speed of light comparisons so did you know that the faster you go\nThat time actually slows down so the people at a speech at the speed of light\nTime does not move at the speed of light it comes to a crawl and it and at the end it stops right\nAnd so if it what what Einstein thought is he's going to ... is going to test this theory out and he's going to put a a an atomic clock\nIn a university is going to put an atomic clock in a uh an airplane and the airplanes gonna fly around the world with it which is going four hundred miles an hour and it's going to prove that when that atomic clock comes back that time I actually\nWent faster for the clock that was in the plane than the one that was in the university\nNow it was only like a billionth of a second difference so it wasn't a big deal right so those speeds four hundred miles an hour you're speeding up ... it's not even gonna matter right and so relative to a an\nEarth that spinning around the sun and the send spinning around a black hole in those galaxies and so and so if all this speed that scales up\nThat a four hundred miles an hour equals a you know in a period of around the ... the world equals eight one billionth of a second and time different so you know that that study of when you start scaling things out for a long distances light years and and so on\nThat you can see you can speed up time if you if you go fast enough on an ... an analogy if you're riding on a train traveling at the speed of light for five years of your life you would have you know exhausted sixty years of earth life because of the speed of what you you were traveling\nSo ... and\nI'll tell you this the there's another another thing like if you could start you know contemplating that there's there's no answer to this I'm not going to tell you that you know there's a there's a reason I'm Talking about this\nThe the other side of the equation is are we ... we have really limited\nSenses okay when you hear scientists talking about what you see in the world and the observable universe you know we're basing all of our knowledge on the things around us based on what we can see here taste touch and so on and so far so the observer ...\nObservable universe is based on what we can see everything that it's ever been measured has been measured based on what we can see\nSo it it ... you know do you trust that the only things in the universe are able to\nBe a you know observed in and take an end do you think that\nWhole universes is limited to just what our senses can detect me already know that you have stuff like infrared that we can't see we eventually figured it out through you know there are processes but do you think there's anything else out there that exist that we just aren't built to to um\nYou know to to experience or say of course the universe was built around around us as a species were probably only getting a\nA a a tiny percentage of the information that's out there to have an understanding of what the world is but from a perspective from our planet\nYou know we're we're building all of our information based on us and our experiences we we have such a limited exposure to to what is so what if I told you if you know your your your brain\nIs really capable of filling in incomplete data so if you're collecting experiments and your brain can make stuff up along the way how much do you trust the experiences that you have if your brain is capable of of of\nYou know you're you're listening to a conversation or you're seeing something and you're only seeing a portion of it is your eyes are darting around but it's filling in the information\n[noise]\nGet murdered Jacob Rosa will get my vote a prison without parole

is the young south computer show I'm Joe Danny under events that computer we're talking about some science stuff today are so if you want to get on the line and share anything ask any questions feel free three three\nO seven to nine or nine nine seven seven a text message events don't happen all at once one event happens then another we since this as time yes our sense of time as malleable that doesn't mean it doesn't exist okay let me\nCorrect that and ... our perception by our perception of ants don't happen all at once in order to say something doesn't happen at once\nYou have to have a constant that you're comparing it what does that mean does that mean that happening in at once as a you know let's just say you take time and you compress it down so like when you're watching video you're watching it thirty frames per second so then the individual slides are you know happening at one\nThirtieth of a second if you compress it down further and you keep pressing it down when does it get so that\nIt's all happening at the same time how fast does it have to happen in succession before it's happening all at one time well it's based on a perception so it depends on who you're talking to you if you're talking\nAbout the you know the cause most something that is trillions upon trillions of years old how long is a day is it noticeable is negligible if it was gone would it be missed\nSo it's the perception that matter so I'm going to you're you're correct in Texas events don't happen at once\nWell by your perception of events don't happen at once if you slow things down and you allowed to be an experience that is what you might call your life and that's what you might call going to college what would happen if you so much that down and made it so that it was unrecognizable how many cycles of a human brain\nGets to dictate whether something is another thing so if if we decide that a day of the day but the universe doesn't feel that it's a day if everything just happened at once\nRight then you could explore going in ... in the end of the future because the future exist at the same time that the past does because there's a thing called space time\nAnd again this is this is the part where you really need to not talk about it you need to just contemplated think about when Einstein delved in to space time ah you know one of the first example is the most crude example that I got to when I when I first started studying this was a you know they they would have these wars in in Asia\nAnd before there was modern communication so that was horseback at at the very fast as travel or on foot usually so when generals used to send orders out there you know the people that we're fighting in the field and then those generals would have people report back how long did it take before those things\nGot back to them so if that cycle at that period of time took three months to travel the the the uh the ocean or or the you know the land mass to get the orders to the the armies and wars lasted hundreds of years right\nWell if the same amount of stuff happened in that time now we crunch that into we can communicate\nAt the speed of light with electronic modern electronics and we can end the war within a day right didn't we not crunch that time and and really travel\nSort of travel through what time if you were to compare if you had something to pick compared against so that's the you know the first ... starting to think about when it when time is valuable it's not an amount of on a sense of you know I can tell a port you to another time and it it would make this would be a a reasonable thing to do regularly\nIt's that you if you if you start taking what you thought was once concrete which is the taking of the clock is not really a thing it's only for us universe doesn't have seconds and minutes doesn't care because of the scale\nAnd and so yeah again I'll I'll just correct you there are so by I agree with you that by our perceptions of ants don't happen all at once but if you can take us out of the equation\nThen maybe it does happen at all times are all things have existed past and present are based on what you know physicist and again these are just there is it's hard to prove this I'm sure\nA next text message this stuff I Love that it's a it's contained going a little bit I hate you I'm curious about when concept of time started being created in human culture past present future and survival\nYou you got to believe that it was from the very beginning when you when somebody started contemplating their existence they had to start contemplating I mean you you had physical things like you had you know the sun coming up and you had the ...\nA visible some time so you had you had things that had a a cycle so that's probably where when there was a natural cycle that became the first\nCalculus all or metric of time and so you got to ... I I just don't I don't know how far you go back before ... ... you know culture started inventing that you think back to the the most ah\nIntelligence would be probably the Greeks but I'm sure there was you know cultures before that that were smarter a but the question there there's more tax coming in as I got it or or do you know how much gravity it takes to make a flat object looked like a sphere an awful lot like a black hole level gravity\nWould be well aware of a black hole within our solar system totally agree to totally agree again by our perception the you know ... when it when we we know what the human body and mind is it they they were able to deal with\nYou know and a black hole rip us apart and rip our solar system apart so these these balances that they're hard to contemplate by our deal but the universe doesn't care about those same standards\nI think that was a flat earth or the thing I tenure throwing that went in there would be a little bit of a bomb or even though our eyes are limited we can build devices that can see at different wavelengths we're actively observing the universe in different ways but we're still observing their eyeballs\nOur eyes and light is are still necessary and the tools that we use\nYou know further give us more information I'll grant that granted I mean if you're going to get more information out of it but still the whole thing you pluck your eyeballs out let's just say we were born without eyeballs the whole understanding of the universe and time in each other and whatever would come be completely different if we were completely guided by\nYou learn you probably haven't started using the new feature so this is going to go over the\nCrash course in the features of I pads and iPhones and a lot of you users

bunch of games on it my son tried to upload all the\nUpdates forming a stop to twenty five percent and it says you know system failed or something like that is is is there anything you know that we can do to get that thing up that it won't go on any any of the programs you know and any of the uh\nOh is he could get on it is just the\nWith what's on the basic um\nOkay so you can't you can't get into windows at all it's just kind of hung up\nYet hung up on windows that wound up the past twenty five percent\n[noise] but can you get to a desktop as it is it usable and it just won't run the updates\nWell that's right yeah you can get this out but he can't when he cooks on like games or any any kind of a game you got on there it won't it won't go into it it won't\nDo any application gotcha ... you're probably going to want to do is do is start up ... or a a a repair\nIf you go ... it's on you said it's windows tenor you said you downgraded the windows rated to windows\nOkay from seven okay yeah if you if you go into a the settings on windows ten um there's a there's a repair in fact I think if you just type in repair\nRight uh yeah so you start menu type and repair yeah and ... and so if you run a repair\nOn what it'll do um it'll start to repair some of the windows files that might have been damaged I'm I that's what I have a feeling that's going on is that the windows has got damaged during an update and it's going to have to be repaired to I Would I Would go into the settings under windows ten\nAnd do a a a repair I think there's two options one is going to be sort of a light option and one is going to be I have a heavy option I Would try the light option first\nAll right um you want to go too far away I don't have it in\nThere and I go on for the for windows and on on this I mean how does does he get in the windows and\nWhile you're in windows ten so you're you're basically going to go to this little set up\nGear so you're going to go to the start button and then uh and then go to\nA the little gear icon and it'll say window settings and then you just type in repair and learned you'll get a a thing that says like reset this PC and then a an option for running a repair will be on that menu\nAll right Joe thanks a lot of them that they thought yeah no problem things going on never mind\nYou there did you have another question\nAre you going to be anywhere else but young study going to be at war and all\nWell we we do we have a road schedule so if a if you need us to come out to you just you just call her office let them know that you want someone to come up to you and they'll be more than happy to schedule something good enough\nI think you appreciate it and so yeah if if any of that if I if you'd like in home we can come to you if you'd like in store you can come to us ah three three to five nine seven to seven eight is the phone number\nUm and I you know I I really appreciate everybody who even engage me in the show especially when I go off topic like that and I know some of you just get flustered with it I get it but those of you who engaged in through some questions that that's that's sort of like the civil part of our debate we can we can disagree and we can throw\nYou know a couple of bombs out there and you can disagree with them but in in the deal like look what comes out of it I don't I don't think that I have the truth or the answer is a pursuit of that truth in the answer is what we're after some were able to throw things out there without taking things personal like I'm right you're wrong\nAnd we can start being a little bit uh more kinder of society so thanks everybody for joining us today for this abbreviated she'll have a great weekend we will see you next week this is the ...

sunny and you're right I mean this has all the makings to be an exciting offensive game\nUm you mentioned South Dakota states have had some success on the offensive share but boy they struggled last week gave up fifty one points to Indiana State a lot of that coming late\nWatching them on film this week yeah there there are definitely some opportunities I think in the past game for Youngstown State to exploit the Jack rabbits secondary but they often for the Jack rabbits is obviously one of the best in the country they come in second in the nation and scoring offense at over fifty one points per game so\nI think the coaching staff and the team does it you know they're probably gonna have to put up up words thirty five forty points to data\nTo be in this one is jak rabbit team can score like no other and are they have a quarterback is going to go down as one of the best in Missouri Valley football conference history is he's got a chance today to set the total yard record in the conference already holds the\nLeague records for touchdown passes and some other ones as well so it's a huge challenge today hopefully we get a clean game I think why is she was just hoping they can put a game together on both sides all seems like they've played well on\nOne side you know in each game and maybe struggled on the other side's are hoping that hope I get a complete game here today and they're going to need it to be the second ranked team in the country\nYeah ... or ... unbelievable numbers to this point Seventy three completion Z a hundred and three attempts one thousand and eighty two yards through the year Fifteen touchdown passes already and he was only thrown won the interception the six to senior having himself one heck of a good senior year\nYeah he does impressive as a gift when you watch them on film he's just so ... you know he's been a three year pretty much for your starter really took over the reins halfway through his freshman season and\nHe's just so composed he's seen every type of defense he's played in the biggest environments went the in the playoffs played around some guys who were in the NFL now so\nHe's seen everything and the thing that makes it with him is he's not going to make mistakes you mentioned the numbers Fifteen touched down to one interception when you watch them on film they just get the ball out so quick you know they're going to spread the defense out a lot of five you know for a wide sets\nThey're going to make this why should defense defend every blade of grass in the field and just put a lot of stress on their defense you know he's going to get it out quicker going to run a lot of quick slant a lot of quick hitters a lot of our PO action today and the thing that makes it so top is as good as they are in the past and they have one of the best throwing quarterbacks in the country they're equally as tough on the ground\nAnd they have an extremely talented stable or back so they have about four different capable running back to that they can hand the ball to they run really hard they have a starting back and Isaac wall is his second in the nation averaging over nine yards per carry so as\nMuch attention and rightfully so that they're passing game gets there just as good on the ground and their ability to combine the run in the past is really what makes them so dangerous\nYeah and and the fact that they do both so well it's going to be very difficult for the defense to key on anybody and you mentioned Isaac Wallace for the season forty four Russia's four hundred and Thirteen yards nine points for yards per pop\nOr you saw in the end zone four times then then they have a a a freshman or a red shirt fresh but I'm Sorry appear strong junior Thirteen carries a hundred and Seventy five yards\nOr this kid comes out of nowhere and then all by the way we got Mikey Daniel thirty three carries a buck fifty four he's a pounded the rock end of the end zone three times just a great stable of running backs they throw the ball well they pass the ball well\nThe defense is going to have to play an unbelievable game in order to get out of there with a victory\nYeah I mean it's a massive challenge and you mentioned that stable a back and it's so nice for them because they're able to stay fresh they can get rotate guys know one guy gets worn down at\nYou know they've had big play ability eyes of wall says that three touchdowns over fifty yards this year we're strong and you mentioned how to sixty five yard touchdown run last week so\nThis is really thrives on big place you know they long runs big chunk passing place but I think if you're Youngstown State today you just have to make them earn everything you know just have to force them to to put together a long drive\nYou know when they get ... plays and get this crowd excited and get big jumps ER is just so difficult mentally as a defense to stay engaged but\nYou just make them work for their points you know if you make them drive the length of the field and they score you can live with that but I think preventing big plays will be big for the site he had his defense today because we saw last week and when this defense had success early against southern Illinois got a couple of three announced got off the field it just seemed like there was confident swear and some other games this year when\nThey got scored on in the first driver western Illinois I remember like right down the field and scored it just set the tone for the whole game and\nYou know in South Dakota states had a year of you know hearing about what Youngstown State did to them physically last year which was a completely dominating performance by the penguins holding the ball or of a forty five minutes so it's going to be extremely motivated jak wrap it seemed that I Do to to sort of you know get some retribution for what happened to stand by stadium I see\nYeah it was about to say South Dakota state was absolutely destroyed by why as you are at ... stadium last year and that and the most impressive part was the fact that the penguins hung on to the ball for all but Fifteen minutes of that game now\nBack stabbing caster he comes off of twenty eight carry one hundred and sixteen yard performance\nSouthern Illinois I it would be nice if the penguins can give the Jack rabbits a taste of their own medicine in that a balanced off ends between my caster Turner\nMaybe a job well let's see and the quarterbacking of Montgomery van border certainly been border cannot afford to throw the ball into the opposition's hands like he did two times last week\nBoom boom boom\nBoom\nBoom boom boom boom boom\nThinking about life insurance and now\nSees hanged way or the other side you have any ...\nDays

I think that's the challenge today if you come after him and you don't get to them a new blitz and he steps up he can take one for sixty Archie to do it all I agree completely you're going to have to put pressure on him but you have to be careful what you get through and you have to get him on the ground because\nWhen he gets out of the pocket he is so dangerous elusive can get out and make throws you know with his eyes down the field but you can also run the football as you mentioned in\nAnd there's a lot of games where he hurts you go through the air and on the ground is thrown for over thirty five hundred yards each in the last three seasons but he really does some damage on broken plays and we saw a couple of weeks ago when I was no annoying with Sean Maguire really told us with a couple of broken plays outside of the pocket and with our secondary having eight guys started back there and\nTrying to find the best combinations it's gonna be a big challenge today\nSo I ... a couple of weeks ago told me he got a phone call from Ann Arbor number wasn't really sure who was they kept calling and\nHappened to be Jim Harbaugh so I think he has that number and Cox access right now so let's go to live in Ann Arbor and not as you're going to be there tonight for the Wisconsin Michigan game huge game but tell us why Harbaugh was calling on what's going on today in Ann Arbor at\nYeah we have discussions over the last ten years or live in Michigan and all that great traditions from before I went there and after all the great all Americans crows came out of there\nI I told them that we have to start bringing in fact we have to bring some of our guys back so he invited a real American every office hemline than anyone to play them for a family farm guys in town\nA chance to talk\nTo yesterday representing all of our guys all of a\nMetal you all Americans or it was awesome it was it was a wonderful time I'm I'm a full day oh my gosh ... or go off with a with the captains are gone over and over again\nUh help them definitely true we're trying to get the coin toss ran in and get a victory there as far as ... leader for them are on the program\nWell my gut tells me if you win that coin toss the rains will differ with that effects correct that is correct that is what I was told that's awesome editor which\nWay but I haven't really miss I feel that they are you guys were talking and I think this was a chance to get our seasons back on track 'em you know bumped when I saw on a ... by South Dakota", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "13"}
