Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two\nAh income information pending what is this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAny weight identifies it as a member of the Green Party a yes he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nRuby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them blow 'em up because they might have\nBlown up in transit although none of them have gone off\nNone of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this isn't everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd until a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just when they had an assigned this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy identifying the the people\nAs Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is that this is this is the\nUh [noise]\nThe narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters\nOf same thing is happening today with the economic news we haven't GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive\nBy reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the at the British in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically\nGoogle also all of his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there\nIs this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that has created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that scare has distracted from news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate\nWhat's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has you might just his\nI sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news and what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or and then it just stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly\nAll of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ahead I've got a pool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll running to Santa has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\nAnd\nSo ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does\nAffect what people think their perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I said is a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nYes tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper with Trump's tweet while someone nonsensical really helped in a row\nVersus ... we're going to bring them the judge\nGeneral Jeff Sessions comments moments before the FBI and I'm Steve arrested a person connected to more suspicious packages phone today all aimed to Democrats are President Trump's critics now twelve explosive devices found the ...\nIt's the dress to senator Cory Booker and former director of national intelligence James Clapper New York city is kind of terrorism director Jon Miller describing the way this explosive found in midtown Manhattan mail facility\nWith a bomb squad was able to do with their equipment or thinking about them X ray inside based on what appears to be a ...\nA consistent with other devices we've seen this week\nThe president tweeting that the explosive packages are hurting his party's election and saying quote Republicans are doing so well an early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the moment the break we slows news about talking politics very unfortunate Andy field ABC News ah\nHappening in the army that aren't getting in and hockey game back in the Sunni mom has been arrested in

I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are they can they are\nAnd I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that I see a\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that side of the document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think this package bombs or a means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy writing these national strike group and bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nThat as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than they've seen anything like it when the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws and they can say the election and valid too much\nGoing on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years\nCalled animal spirits and that's really about positive sentiment with increased volatility that impacts animal spirits ... were actively engaged with clients as we work with them through this volatility\nThanks Michael your path through investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor by yours at ... dot com that's S C I F ... dot com steeple Nicholas incumbent he incorporated member sci fi see an ad why I see [noise]\nYour brain is an amazing thing as you get older it naturally begin to change causing a lack of ... or even trouble three calls [noise] thankfully\nThe breakthrough in ... and how your brain and actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in ... in clinical trials can happen sound can improve short term memory criminal Jim healthier brain better life for ...\nStatement did not been in a way to buy the FDA this product of not intended to treat shore or prevent any TV [noise]\n\n\nBreathing talking back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal evolution\nTo Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us hot\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if\nI can remember that the privilege for me to have you here too so what's shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted to\nAdd and I love that pedigree look at where you come from you come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm so I'm sure he's listening\nToday oh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what you bring\nThat up I have to tell you we we we are ...

the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I don't know what early vote registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was not Trump is drawing that parade\nPresident Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare has distracted\nFrom news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting in at the polls and now this\nStuff happens and the\nWell mine's him greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans would go out and vote that\nWas Trump's tweet now\nThere are some who believe that this is another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and the way the backup what she was alleging so some people think that he's um during the same thing here are basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression of state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd there's some people think that this is very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome luck of the obstacles that we that we came through\nAnd we try out\nSo we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nTweet in uh let's see there be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need it inside the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN\nPoll and it probably isn't an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen but here forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest\nAnd also forty seven percent ... points higher than Obama's approval rating under twenty ten minute terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\n\nThis ... a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win and the two thousand ten men terms I'm\nSick the free\nThe Republicans won the the three now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit of an upset\n[noise] there's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yes your ego\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for gray television\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is gonna in tight Gillum had some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated\nFor a we have the news that he had he paid an Under Cover\n...\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with that in corporate could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today I actually saw it last night\nThat Trump fears a Florida wipe out that Donald Trump\nFear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a
