what do you see\nWhat I've observed a president who examine leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and you had a response from the liberal media today ... the president\nAnd they should instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nIn leadership yesterday called for the country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time for family and the president shameful I that the New York times today tends to publish an article tend to put the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from these devices being delivered and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off and so a nearby Secret Service agent hands but Russian assassin his gun\nSincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well we must publishing stories that really three I don't live with the mother investigation of Trump and from what they've got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying into Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs to change it Donald Trump didn't meanwhile\nThey can call him a Nazi they can call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is in the show on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself has that taken last night at has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning that it was CNN his fault\nWhich basically is it came to a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely ... saying that CNN and was responsible for that because the fake news that they're spreading because no one fall but the arranged maniac sending does\nI Hope of all let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record and then a python showed up and not culpable\nFor in the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than anyone an anchor on that network endorse the play and Central Park depicting the assassination and the president saying that\nThe leader right now you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump\nBlaming CNN is akin to because they got about never see is like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um\nThe conversation continues you're now you're here to senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than a thousand things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal for anyone and gotten some a lot about\nWhat about the language and I'm having an outlet and very fast content is modeled cut hair Brennan\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday he saw the president come out saying it's abhorrent white America stand for black man if I Want to be an engineer who can blame that on the president can blame there from Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move us forward forward at fighting the low road President Trump that the highlights whatever and Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hand here yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump\nAnd of course using this I'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\n... and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to bite your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the rule is here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go I Phil Donahue used to do is all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look the difference it made for me it if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal\nWith this that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer to the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't they were the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he says\nIncorrect and so forth but that one does
