Marion Don will hold on for you are going to be going to break here and a few seconds\nAnd then we'll come back and get you to on there so you can when you've done something and you've done it right and it's worked well just keep doing what you're doing don't change your plan\nJust because of something else keep going with it\nOn there so and again Mary done we'll get to you after the break marry your first Don your next hopefully we'll get to both of you this is a plant care show\nI'm Phil Steiner and remember after me is Joe Dan yang Youngstown computer show will be back\nIn just a few [noise]\n\nFrom [noise]\nFrom [noise]\nFrom [noise]\nWent and I just want to talk about colonial gardens again on one for one nine Youngstown kings middle road in by Anna their phone numbers three three zero five three nine five five zero zero the scissors thirty this year in business\nWebsite colonial gardens Ohio dot com and they still can help you decorate fir phone\nAnd they've got the corn stalks the straw bale still got some moms around\nPumpkins all kinds of things to help you decorate they've still got also they're twenty percent off on trees and shrubs they got the ... the stones everything there and always when you go and you should be going check out there in store items\nEverything they have there\nTo help you out they've got a gift certificates also\nCheck 'em out colonial gardens in ... Ohio the place to shop this fall and you can still plant there is no problem with planning this time of year it's a great time to get things in the ground because the roots\nWill continue to grow all fall and winter until the ground freezes six to twelve inches deep which I Hope it doesn't do this year honestly I wanted to stay nice so check 'em out let's go to the phone lines and Mary how are you\nOh I'm fine thank you for taking my call Cheryl what can I Do Korea I couldn't ... [laughter]\n\nI guess and it but and I don't know when they caught it down or how far they cut it down or what but like you\nSay this is an outdoor one yeah\nOkay um it's pretty much done I assume and the leaves are starting to drop off of it yeah\nOkay uh you can cut it down anytime you want to but always I like to leave it at least six inches of stem on it so I can find it next spring you have it in a flower bed or where is it\nIt well then she thought oh it's in a pot yeah how long have you had it in the pot I Am we brought it in the last\nOh okay so this is a tropical had discuss yeah oh okay you don't want to do what I just said scratch [laughter] I was thinking it was a hearty viscous okay so is it still flowering\nStopped by the week or two\nA day so how tall is it six foot it\nOK Scott good foliage on it everything there I Am you can bring it in the house now um\nDoes it have leaves on the top three feet or what's that got yeah\nI it has like looks like\nOkay if it's still growing bringing in the house don't trim it now I'm just let it keep growing keep watering it as needed not do any fertilization until next spring and then you're going to want to trim it at some point in February [noise]\nUm when it stops growing new leaves than lightly trim it across the top you know maybe down six inches or so\nAnd you'll be set good when it starts to grow new growth next spring that's when you want to fertilize it how can I write\nDown and say All right thank you were at a time have a good weekend [noise] All right see talk to everybody next week I have a great

stuff we're however it applies to making us a better\nConsumer and person and stuff like that will will definitely delve into south through the o seven to nine nine nine seven seven to go to Mike first Mike you're on the computer so how can help you\nYeah All right thanks for taking my call our question I'm Wondering how much of a troubled shooting acknowledge related more about\nUm [noise] I'm a parent and I have young one and I just recently started doing research and things that without frequently maybe harmful things that are transmitted from like your wife fire out or anything related to anything being transmitted through the air with\nYou know and even the difference between a five gee a channel on around her but you point for you know which one is more say\nThose are my current and a lot of people are ... and ... or\nSomething and they all agreed with me for my for my business or whatever but I think a large part of that industry doesn't really talk about maybe health risks associated with it but I don't put in you know we're position and I apologize but\nI figure you're very knowledgeable and you might have come out or information\nYeah sure about four or five years ago we actually dedicated a program to this and I had data sitting in front of me where I could read reference I'm at a disadvantage because I don't have that data and there but I'll give you the sort of the summary and maybe we'll do next week we'll do a show just on this\n... so you're right that we have all of these bands that are all are devices are using these radio frequency bands\nAnd some of us out there are really sensitive to too much of that those frequencies you know in small spaces so that you know the further we're broadcasting these wireless the more dense the uh\nThe the antennas in the in a a you know the receivers and and and not what not [noise] I mean I've I've heard that it makes some people paranoid some people that can't sleep around it and so we looked into studies about what if you like put a person a fair day cage where they can be no interference that comes into that\nYou know how does it change their biology and has it changed their brain and they're thinking and stuff like that and so yeah I think it's worthwhile to maybe bring that up and and bring the data back and see how things have changed in the last couple of years\nOkay and then um yeah so I mean before we get to that point actually for the short term opinion on whether or not you point for safer and five a gay or channel on why\nI don't in fact when when we talked about at the top of the deal was the two point four ... because it was wireless gee at the time so I'm I don't think you know now that data was even available so we'll have to look at it with a new ah you know kind of knew that do that new lens\nOkay Appreciate it thank\nYou yeah no problem Thanks Mike appreciate it and it's ... and it is a concern I mean in a couple of weeks from now we're going to be talking about the blue light that all these electronics are are are are you know how they're by the way it was explained to me is that we don't have any natural defenses of blue light in our written out right so\nA blue light affects us more than anything else and all of our electronics our phones or tablets on our screens there all this beaming us even fluorescent lights I mean people have headaches like\nAnd and they are their their vision is being their eyeballs or being damaged by the blue light that we're allowing to enter into our eyes and and I can remember in the eighties and nineties we had the blue blockers and all that kind of stuff so there were there at length some credibility into that\nYou know some of this stuff might be killing us really slowly and taking little sliver is out of our life and little sliver of our health and you know it's hard for because there's so much of it for for scientists to draw direct conclusion to say yeah you know what are these screens that we're looking at about nine hours a day you're going to be blind by the time that you're you know you're fifty\nAnd so yeah we'll we'll have to look at both of these are the frequencies that works posing ourselves and\nKids as they grow up I mean I I mean think about it I mean we we we we suffer from a lot more\nUh you know diseases and and ah I I don't know what they call it ... the ... and all those kinds of things or could it be that it's because of this you know the frequencies that we're putting it's almost like you know the tuning fork there's got to be like a couple of magic ones in there that that that really don't do great\nThings to you and so it it's worth looking into but I I'm not an alarmist in this I you know I'm I'm keenly aware\nThat our bodies naturally probably don't have many defenses against dense frequencies being in short you know close proximity I don't know what those things are if it creates a liquor irregularities in your biology or sells Mao form I don't know if it's that your neurons get\nA get changed around and so you have different thought thought impulses and you're able to remember things and think differently and so on and so forth but our our our bodies are are are amazing at what they're able to do with what we threat I mean we we feed it poisons just about every day at our life right and it's still figures out a way to keep us alive and and\nInto the next day so I I wouldn't be surprised if it's not great for us to have anything they the air we breathe the frequencies were around the the a different\nLight that were exposed to the heat's works but none of it's probably great but our body always has a way to\nTo you know to get us through it but again I I'll look into some of that data and see if there's anything for us that you know that we can explore in that we can share but for sure we're going to do the uh the uh the blue light and so from the science standpoint but it's all going to be scientific I'm not going to take this\nYou know we're we're we're I'm convinced I'm not going to try to convince you until we've got some data sitting in front of me that's where I'd be most comfortable so\nAh let's see three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven let's go to gym next to Jim you're on the computer so how can help you\nMind on this journey package and\n[noise] All right thanks for the phone call appreciate it\nAll right so I'm\nA first topic I told you we got a bunch of them for today and uh and I'm going to go first with one you might well first let me give you windows ten update or October is when a Microsoft notoriously comes out with a a big update so may updates in October updates are the ones that are usually or the the the big ones\nGot word that the October update which should be coming up next week Tuesday of next week or no ... what's the third Tuesday so that would be the following Tuesday\nA is pretty big and they there's actually some evidence of filed deletion now that's how it was in the news article I don't know if that means data you know your data your word documents or whatever or if it's just files ... damage a corrupt the operating system but that word concerns me a great deal\nSo what I Would do is I Would suggest that you put a pause on\nThe October now you can't opt out\nJust not a thing anymore when you take a license for windows ten you it's a windows for license ten you have to take every update that's thrown out of the only deal is that you can go into the settings and go into windows updates and you couldn't put updates on pause and I think it's like thirty two days as what they'll give you I\nSuggest you do that uh and that will buy you well into November and that way if they if they find the problem and they changed the update that will bring out so when you get on a Monday and and your office and\nUh at your home computers you know put a positive updates just to be safe I mean not that I Know as soon as I say that that somebody will

dot\nCom powered by Don al for an end on al ... cells cars and ... service chiefs customers [noise]\nAll\nRight we'll come back everybody one of my favorite songs they're trapped headstrong\nThis is the young sound computer show we have you ah for another hour and a half years if you want to get on the phone lines and not asking questions there and experiences with the are more than welcome\nA three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven and\nA ... we make this so that it it it isn't a show that you're afraid to call and ask a basic question 'cause I'm telling you there are a thousand other people that also have the same basic question that you do and I'm not going to make fun of you were going to use your question to them talk through that deal and you're going to be able to help other people out there that to have that basic\nQuestion so don't think that it has to be at a certain level in order to call here\nI I Will not judge the I promise three three oh Seventy nine nine nine seven seven a person texted and the crux of there there was a it's a pretty long\nA message but they're gonna have some work done with young sons computer they got an appointment scheduled in a question about the ah the computer has they won Tara bite or Seventy two hundred rpm hard drive and want to know solid state drives a combat big and so this is a good opportunity for me to tell you might be all on solid state jobs now\nSo the difference between a mechanical hard driving a solid state Dr first officer or a mechanical Dr think of it as there's this uh\nMiddle enclosure and inside the metal enclosure there's a bunch of stacked\nAre cylinders desks like you know CDs and they're in their in their ... metal\nAnd so there's Reed arms that are above the than below the uh the the desks and they spin super fast and the read arms move all along the platters and read data off of them okay so you have a couple of activities or you have a motor that spins the platters\nAnd then you have a mechanism an arm that you know puts a magnet across the surfaces of the desks as it spans and so you are able to collect data\nAt the speed at which the disks spin\nAnd in this case they have fifty four hundred rpm drives they have Seventy two hundred rpm drives and they have ten thousand rpm drives the faster you spin spin the desks the faster the ... it can come up with the data and the last time that you as the use or have to wait\nSo if you have a hard drive that both of the same capacities then one costs significantly less than the other one you're probably looking at one that's a fifty four hundred rpm drive which is significantly slower than the Seventy two hundred rpm drive\nNow so I Would say drives you don't have spinning parts their access just like a memory module that ah that that's on your ... you know in your computer with ram\nAnd the the difference I mean there is a major performance difference when you don't have to have moving parts access data\nAnd went in there just stored digitally on a a on a memory chip so to answer your question is yes they make solid state drives that are\nAre that are you know one Tara button capacity but it's really expensive memory I mean that's the big advantage to regular hard drives is that they were always cheaper than the ... Dr seed picked that because the difference was between you know an eighty dollar hard drive and a half five hundred dollar hard drive\nWell those prices have come down now but the capacities aren't\nYou know it can't throw the one terribly number out there and give you a hundred and twenty five dollar drive so what what we suggest doing as your your your computer organize itself into two components so the first component is going to be everything that the operating system needs and the programs need to operate\nRight and typically that's going to be around you know be somewhere between a eighty gigs and you know two hundred gigs depending on on your staff and that's just typical you might have\nPrograms that are much larger than that ... programs and so on and so forth but let's just say you decide in most cases that have two hundred and fifty\nSolids they drive is plenty to how's your programs and you're operating system\nThen you can get a much slower drive even a mechanical drive that were speed is really not a a you know a big deal and that can be your\nYou know your songs your movies your documents the things that take up space but don't really need to be fast you're operating system files need to be fast you turn on your computer hit the button you want to be at a desk top as quick as possible so all those programs all those\nFiles have to load in a certain sequence you want that to be fast but then your word document you don't need word documents to be fast so I wouldn't use your really fast stored space for things that don't need to be fast reserve that for stuff that does need to be fast so if you open adobe photo shop put it on the fast drive\nYou don't need it it's something to be fast put it on the the slower Usb drive external Dr internal mechanical dry so\nBasically the answer is yes they do but I don't know of anybody that that really makes sense to do I would I Would feel better\nGetting a you know what maybe a hundred and twenty five hundred and fifty dollar\nA solid job of high performer like a ... get a good good solid stay dry for your operating system\nMove all the stuff that can be moved off to an external drive and then use that for all of your data so that's that's my suggestion\nOr for you so three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven you can text me at three three three one five Seventy is always suggested it it's always happen and I'm a I'm a big time listener of this program all week long and uh so I program the tax number and the\nPhone number but I find myself taxing a whole lot more than I Do calling and when I'm driving along and I need to you know just either vent off a snarky comment I can just send it off on a Texans ways there and I like is the host here being able to read your snarky comments even if I don't read them on the air there still fun\nOr as you product me so feel free to save those numbers off so you can\nAh contribute and snark at but the rest of the hosts throughout the week as well just one time I told you three three three one five Seventy is that number three three three one five Seventy\nOkay let's go to dean next day and you're on the computer so how can help you\nA question for you I I'm\nThe last forever and that's great I'm Glad that there are phones out there but I'm telling you that I'm the U.S as consumers we're we're we've really put up with\nYou know all like all these electronics that are that are less durable than they should and that's that's my main\nComplaint is that I should not have to be doing screen cracking Zinn by special cases that defend against drop drop age I think your your your phone should should have what it needs built in and make it easy to grip and make it so that if I drop it under certain conditions that it doesn't break I mean\nI don't know I I maybe it's a lot to ask but I just don't think we should ... the deal is that you have a phones that have two two screens you're going to have the\nStuff that's more durable that doesn't crack and it's usually softer material so that it scratches versus a Chris clear you know glass screen that ends up\nCracking if you drop it so if you don't drop it glasses prefer because it's so much clear it doesn't do allow that doesn't scratch versus something like a plastic where yeah I don't have screen cracks\nBut it's still doll because it's scratching my keys in my change arrive pocket and it just looks you know terrible so anyway it's a it's just one of my one of my complaints for the day I guess\nAll right where it takes more phone calls right gets more technical stuff uh if you want to get on the lines three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven or you can text me here at three three three one five Seventy you're listening to the ... computer show on five Seventy WKBD animals right back [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back everybody this is the Youngstown computer show I'm Joe ... owner of young south computer in your host here talking about uh things are happening technology I like talking about business a science a big thing physics everything's really are on the table\nI said if you got anything on your mind three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven as I introduced last week uh we had a a ... which he bought into the residential services of Youngstown computer he's\nA organizing some classes I told him from the beginning I mean we we sort of got involved in this area\nMost by the training that we were able to do with people we were we were good about sitting down with a group of people that would follow us from class to class a lot of you in the audience remember we used to do every Wednesday we invite a group of you down and we'd fill a room up\nA and you know I was I was one of those cool instructors that uh we would we would teach a topic and then everybody and they got to talk about what they wanted to learn next and then we decided to next Wednesday as was going to be that topic that the students all picked out and then these people will just take classes after class and they got to sort of create their own\nYou know curriculum about what they really wanted to learn and a lot of what they picked was was pretty predictable it's all of us as consumers this stuff creeps up on us and you know you know you are not using your iPhone and ... and half of the features\nA that it that it has possible because you just don't know about them so he took a class you might be able to an earth one or two things that you didn't know I mean most of the features might not even be relevant to you might not use use them even if you need them\nBut what these what what are workshops do is allow us to talk through the features that are available and if one interests you you can figure out how to use it and how you know to get to those functions that's where these things are ... where she specifically starting with iPhone and iPad could just a lot of people out there that have that a\nDeal we picked October Seventeen that gives us plenty of time to get the classes\nAre all filled up I'm calling I'm workshops I don't know what Matthew calling but there's no these are the Joe workshops are going to follow the same\nSort of feel uh that you're used to with the ... computer workshop so I'm holding two of them and this is kind of a new thing I Would always be the six to eight pm one because that's when I got done with my field work but he's going to do a morning one nine to twelve one\nAs well so if you're you know if you can do it during the day\nOr he's got one in the morning one in the evening and then during the evening one we're also going to be streaming that so if you can't make it if you're if you're stuck you can't leave and you want to stream you can buy a seat and we'll make sure that you get a ... a link to that so if you're interested color office three three oh two five nine Seventy seven eight let them do you want to take the iPhone I packed\nClasses spend two or three hours with us talking about this ... introduce all of the features that you might not even know this thing does so again three three oh two five nine Seventy seven eight and that's fifty dollars a seat for the October seventeenth workshop or take a break come back takes more phone calls this is the young some computer show on five Seventy WKBD and we'll get back [noise]\n\n[noise] I Do walk for anti go ... go up there and runners dot com is news radio five seven WKBD in young south [noise] [noise]\nThe ascension of Brett Kavanaugh and now all but assured Republican Susan\nCollins of Maine and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia indicating they will vote with nearly all Republicans for Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court ABC's Murray bruised on Capitol Hill\nYou know sort of this social problem where none of us can stay in the same room without you know finding a way to make an enemy or you know polarizing every discussion with just about every topic we just we're just not good at handling disagreement\nAnd that sort of like what everybody can agree on his we're just not good at that were pre program survivalists were competitive we go make stuff we go break stuff right that's just in our nature of who we are so you get enough of this and the rumor and figure out a way that were ways that were different and where to start a war over it with ... with each other\nAnd I think that's just our gift and that's not something that you have to kind of short circuit but I'm going to volunteer at this point like when we when we first started you know we we learn where we watched the movie the matrix where\n... the machines came and took advantage of of people and they put them in this little bubble use their energy but then gave them the simulation the simulated world\nOkay well I thought that was terrible and we think about your not live in a real world it's a simulation but right now I think I'm going to volunteer for the simulation if anybody at some point let's let's get through a whole you know seeing my kid graduate and going off\nAnd then I Will volunteer be the first person put in that simulation just give me a really good simulation if I can pick out some of the features of the simulation allow me just expiring complete happiness void of all of this other stuff that we have to ... you know contemplate\nI I might be the first person in line for that so maybe we're gonna matrix ourselves by just a\nYou know we're we're we're in a raise our hand have enough volunteers to be able to pull off so out there I mean are you listening out there would you volunteer to be put into a bubble and have a a reality anything if you're choosing you can really it's it's a computer game some of you out there thinking maybe you're already in a simulation and I I'm not going to argue with you there is no way to prove or disprove I mean\nIf it is and I'm a really crappy simulation designer or maybe I'm really good I don't I don't know it's up to this point I'm my my life has been a really fun ride I mean there's a lot of things that I'm going to be able to put in a book\nOr the excitement is the highest the lows and you know the suffering the chaos to completion the successes of the winter I mean all of a ... I got a sampling of every human emotion\nIn in every variety imaginable right so but right now I'm looking at like ... you really can't have a conversation with another human being and expect it to go super well I mean I'm an a kid's birthday party yesterday right and\nUh if if if somebody brings up politics we think happens do you think the\nThe the party just continues or do you think it somebody ends up feeling that if they don't say anything we're we're really good at this passive just accepting stuff we don't like to hear sometimes it and you know sucking it down and not making a scene and think we're doing somebody of service but we're really feeling it makes us feel bad so these interactions and conversations end up\nMaking us feel a little bit back 'cause we're so terrible at\nIn our engaging people that we don't agree with\nYour you're seeing it on line where you know when we first started I started getting involved that you had those you know the keyboard warriors that in real life that they would uh they wouldn't say booty un whereas a docile as they can but you put him behind the keyboard and that they fight with you and say things that they would never in a million years say in real life because you'd knock 'em out right\nWell these keyboard warriors they gave that strength of this is how people really feel they've been putting on a\nA charade in real life and this is how they really are\nBut technology is that separates us it allows us to be more comfortable and who we really are and guess where we go when we're acting were allowed to act who we really are you know our inner animal that's where we ended up going 'cause that's how we're wired we meet we need big crusades we need to be surviving lions you know we need big things and what will in our war what is that\nRight so I ... if we're not engaging the bigger problem solver and all of us we get bored and we you\nKnow ... we'll we'll pick a crusade and if we have to make one up will make it I mean there's ... there's not a thing that goes by and your daily life that you can't get all pissed off about it and let ruin your day right you come across something and it's only when you when you pass\nOn not getting upset about something that you're like hey I remember the last time that it got cut me off in traffic I was upset for the last next half hour and my lunch didn't taste the same and I went home until my wife about how bad it was affected me all freaking day\nAnd then when somebody cut you off you're like oh you know what you got you got to get somewhere faster than I Am and new don't let it affect you and you move on to the next thing you're like whoa look at all the energy that I burn I'm just being mad about something\nAnd he put much of us are you know enough of us are\nCentered in consider at people in a blender guess what's going to happen somebody is going to do something that's going to piss you often and\nYou you're going to spend lots of your energy and figuring out ways to to blow off steam so I you know put yourself in a simulation and run around from were run away from lions and do some real survival stuff really put the ... of being strong not strongly on a keyboard not strong beyond passive aggressive behavior let's start you know\n... you know take sit down sit down in front of someone you disagree with on every level and walk away from the the conversation without ruining a relationship right\nYou you just\nYou know boil yourself down to the worst version of you in the conversation ... try to say it all and be honest but do it in a way that you you're looking to nurture the relationship or they'll have a second meeting with you because it went so well\nAnd so I I don't know if you've you've followed Twitter or Facebook even from every level to politicians all the way down to just the regular us is\nUh everybody can't seem to hold\nA you know that common I I\nDon't know what to call and we just don't have the ability to connect with people any more but that's that was our big concern in the beginning about computers and technology creates disconnection where\nYou know we're we're ... before the phone and when it was connected the wall and it was really cumbersome way to go outside and talk to people so we were forced to get over ourselves to be able to mingle with other people and do it in a way that satisfactory allows us to have interactions again\nWhen things are easing conversations reason we don't have to do that stuff so we get really bad at it and I think we're just on that path right now again a complaint that society in general\nA technology is not getting asked to be better so one of your big skills if you want to teach your kids about how to be good in a technical world\nRight number one is teaching them how to filter out truthful things and untruthful things knowing what the differences\nIf I teach every grandma out there or how to\n... you know sniff out a a spam email or a scam telephone call right on teaching a skill set to find out what they really think is true and not taking guesses addict 'cause that's like gambling I'm Talking about really sniffing it out and there are real strategies\nTo protect yourself against things that are true and not your we have no clue in this society what\nThe difference between truthful things or not because we've lost the ability to be objective everything is this emotionally tied thing instead of saying yes it's true or no it's not it has an asterisk\nNext to it well it's not true but ... in a world like that that that leaves yourself way open to not know the difference between what a truthful thing and it's not and then having to advocate for non truthful things and keep convincing people that are out\nRambling sorry brio

is for\nA whereas you know if you're a brand new users sometimes uh you need a little bit more one on one somebody sit down and if you take your time explain things a little bit slower\nOr so that you can get a good foundation so that you can take one of these workshops that's how I'm going to set it up anyway\nA Mac kind of agreed with me that uh this practical standpoint as a way that we want to go on these things are because everybody including myself there are some times when I go to teach the class and in my pursuit of writing out of syllabus I'll\nFind something I didn't know different
