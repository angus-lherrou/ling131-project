Know the unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unified behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next\nTwo weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes fears head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic Colorado graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up with a TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a hand of election this caravan thing you know I [noise]\nI continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart bill analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal amount it's\nFact what you find in the drive by immediate isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paying for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve\nPart is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious you know there there there is no you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nIt ought to scare everybody it is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it\nWith seven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of leftist set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think\nOrganically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentments\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues you know an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and they eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only\nA fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house this is almost identical to five\nThirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan what\nTwelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported and we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go\nThe cook Political Report today has shifted eight house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans with fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecast there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported the non partisan election\nForecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive\nFundraising haul in the third quarter of this

running all Trump spreads lives in stokes fear ahead of elections\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about miss states are there is no body in Iraq Obama's league\nIn terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced my twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to do\nI'm Wondering Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they are doctrine plan there wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we know from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turns out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives with my men to make fools out of people they get there and do agree with Obama's status takeover of one six of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats are doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nIn the media running banner headlines Obama's spreads wise and stalks the urge to pass Obamacare\nNo way how about the bad guys disaster with Obama and Hillary lying for him on\nThat a video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of Cosby on rafts ... to about riots and men godly knowing all along and it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are alive is designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fools decision how about the law is Obama\nTold about drawing a red lines in Syria the Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception is upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats as the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousand and ten but germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody well\nWhat'd you think about it was great to God remembers guard or remember who was\nIn the ad is based in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to him but you're you're so far but neither of you can't see you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it was great a communist ... for Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances is life depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible\nBut beyond that you get this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia\nOn getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty twelve right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began the it's\nOh this is not just a a few Democrats of fuel left us this is pretty much all of them believed to one extent or another that Mueller has the goods because of the goods are there to be found\nEven though the media haven't been able to find a reporter they've got this hope invested so now it's two or three different stories warning Democrats the lower their expectations\nAnd this latest one here from the week it's a it's a really long piece how the mother fairy tale endings\nUm the the author Matthew Walker hates Trump he isn't bitter is bitter about having to admit that the investigation has gone\nNowhere\nThat's why you're calling it the Mahler fairy tale [noise] they really believe despite the absence of any evidence despite what there is to know about how the FBI stacked the deck and planted spies and invented the\nField I see a that was Hillary despite all of this that's known they either don't know what because they have it exposed himself to media reporting it or they have heard it and are ignoring it\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey'd been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen the things they think are real are so devoid\nOf reality and truth that they're on able do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up at a rally\nAfter rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelling at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a frenzy and attacked the press to me is the the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist man\nOh man we're has this guy begin to see Trump\nWhipping people up and rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a\nGym you can get but you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well Mr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou're thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in\nAnd do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all going to get a laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this like\nI'm going to cut your throat and you know just it I I went up to him after was over and I talked to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you can find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand emails let the media they love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide\nThe emails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... ... ... ... but they just I I've never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other\nHe goes up to this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you doing I really didn't want to see what you're ... you know I'm just wondering what the dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun\nWith you so these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for ... the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump\nBut you let somebody throw it back on them and it said guy give a disgrace that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand the real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who acted him\nI think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that when we get back\n[noise] somebody has to have to say Russia's probably by being met for\nThem valley news radio five Seventy\nN.

Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back things will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power\nThey've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past them kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning\nPromised to do this that and the other to get an office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support it but able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've\nHad in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling\nFor the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting\nIn New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pass it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to look behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly ...\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear they have the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you in Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're fooled and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to want peace\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at\nYale his

says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... the only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America does folks not that every leftist hates\nAmerica but the leftists either no rights go Lerner at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his

convinced you\nWhat Trump investigated too and they're\nJust going to be tied to have it for you to join them so now you're part of the problem is still the American left in the media are actually

Ramos or whatever\nIt is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it ... right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it\nI don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like they're kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise] you know on the street I mean they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on over his left shoulder and he ...\nHe was telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nAnd these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead and TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats pool\nAsked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Coney end up Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which he has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nThat are worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it worth it because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods\nSo they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them now you got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as a reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has it worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nTo be tied\nOver it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to

the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure border control a American political systems\nAnd it's it's designed to make people I think put up their hands like summer started we can't stop at rush we can't stop it we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of of clower proven or pivot in eastern sociologists who believe that the way to really transform America the way they're really get this country right is to destroy it\nBy overwhelming the welfare state just nothing as many people as possible demanding in claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's of I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun\nIt illustrates America is by itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to Sharon it's not fair we have so much they have so little and they live so relatively close\n\nDon't doubt the politics of this for eight minutes and they are not humanitarian the politics of this are decidedly\nRelated and associated

person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody's male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable\nAnd needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by\nSensible scientists so this is the party of sites a Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and so forth climate change\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Josh it was safer and in wrote endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea that a person sex\nIs determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and

and you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this\nFor decades\n\nAre anatomy does not\nSay what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity well we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream
