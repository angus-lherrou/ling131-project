win the mega millions jak part of the Powerball but he's still wondering what if I did\nAnd there's nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves visionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins or you what do you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way we know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch\nReally far so that's part of the process and with\nEverything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political science we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream I Wonder and we think it I go by that took it why would I Do think that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance in a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however\nI see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nShow and so you think about turnout not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say OK why can't I have\nX Y Z and you've so that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with\nAnd so it's not about being able to put into that\nIt stretches and it sets and tension really different is\nThere such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know why\nShould I mean if we dream that did that then we don't follow it up with anything then I mean that creates us to go into things like anxiety or even the beach oppressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we solved again we self doubt we self sabotage\nMm speaking with Laurie Dixon visionary coach based in Dallas texas returning about how you can turn your big lotto dreams into improving your life or a somewhat of a reality I'm so explain to the visualization process what do you do say the day after you didn't win you know a billion dollars in the jackpot\nWell I talk a lot about being in the comfort zone and in the status quo of life and so if you didn't when you have to at least recognize where am I stuck\nWhat's keeping me and not comfort zone of life what can I Do differently today and take one step up and one step out\nSet an intention towards something new so what is that new dream or that new opportunity like we're suggesting so it's one step at a time\nI saw a bullet point in your notes here what I thought was interesting uh what do you say is the fastest way to destroying your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotaged by others but self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we allow the fear and why do we do have to say yeah why why how how do we stop or why do we do both you\nKnow how we stop doing a start to really realize who we are and valuing those aspects at ourselves\nAnd so it's being able to be reflected a little bit which not a lot of people enjoy and it's looking inward and saying you know I Am really about that in

anything else that they've told us about these devices specifically\nAuthorities have been releasing very few details about the specific that the the fight that they were saying that these are capable of\nBeing lies explosive whether or not they are it's still unclear we know that they have taken X rays at the it's explicit than are examining those and are going through the wiring than the battery is and the overall material that these are constructed from\nIt's hard to ignore who the targets are George Soros the Clintons the Obamas CNN and John Brennan Eric Holder Debbie Wasserman Schultz as

at that rally call for the media to unite the country he also tweeted on Thursday again blaming the media\nFor that he said that a very big part of the anger that we see in our society is caused by basically fake news and that it's gotten so bad that it beyond description of what we say here is I think very standard of the president I these days says that he is not wanting to take the blame for himself I Would imagine that would be\nPretty careful that impact and intimate with at work to ... that the blame for that and putting it back to one of his ... targets which is the media\nYeah it's

sent these out thank you very much Lauren Meyer reporter for access thanks for joining us thank you so much\n[laughter]\nElection season and you know you've been getting all the robo calls you've seen all the ads on TV but the most popular way this here for political campaigns to reach voters is not through these ads on social media it's not TV it's not these robo calls\nIt's flooding cell phones with personalized political text messages and while they might be annoying they don't violate the rules on automated both texting it's called peer to peer messaging so we spoke to David McKay but he's a tech reporter at X. deals for more on this\nAnd these are what are called peer to peer messages so you said robo calls they're not quite like a robocall which is often recorded an auto dial dial more people because it's a machine during that island but to get around federal rules regarding robocalls number of attacks major actually peer to peer so it's another person at the end of the line and becoming more popular with political campaigns\nThere's companies now that have offered computer platforms are mobile apps that these people can use where it'll auto film whatever message it is the key as you were saying the peer to peer these campaigns need somebody to literally hit send for every single one and they say that these people can ... thousands of them and our\nRight I mean they use these platforms on both the left and the riot problems like open sesame for us old you know but that's my right hustle to on the on the left to send these tax than it is actually building a a platform to do that at scale and of course it's not entirely unlike phone banking we all know that people can go and they\nWill call and they have political candidates often a common space with other people supporters so it's not entirely unlike that in terms of\nIt being another person on the other other side of the equation\nAnd the reason why these are gaining in popularity is just because they are so effective I think they have an open rate of like about Ninety percent basically if they send it to you you're more than ... Ninety percent likely to actually open it and read some of it at least so the the engagement is there\nAnd open to me which is one of these providers to Ninety percent of tech method is I read within five minutes and I mean I think that is in ... we know how impactful that could be given\nThat we get so much political email so much political mail in this election in every election now and there's so much messaging it any way to break through the voters is a big deal for campaign and\nThis is the daily die weekend edition we'll be right back with more about personalized political text messages and how to get them to stop capsule back to the daily dive weekend edition let's continue our conversation with David McCain heck reporter for Axios about personalized political text messages [laughter]\nRight I mean we're glued to our phones and you tend to open a text message you hear that little paying you tend to open it right away almost as you said within five minutes a lot of times\nWe're kind of conditioned all ready to ignore a robocall or ignore call that comes in from a suspicious number or an email you kind of already can see by the headline or something that it's spam or something like that but with these text messages you're really unclear about what it is so you have to open it\nBroadly speaking the tax message inbox is a ... ad heavy spot for many\nPeople not everybody but I think generally speaking we the that the messaging after may really popular people and and they have not been monetize in the same way as opposed to Facebook or Twitter where people are now more used to ads in the feed and messaging were brother being\nBecause things are moving so fast and all the regulatory stuff is always so far behind\nSome people are very against this chat bought disclosure law\nBecause they think that it might quiet or Stein the innovation\nIn the ... market which actually you know these kind of automated tech services have a really utility and so there's a lack of regulation and then there may also be a knee jerk need to regulate out of fear\nIt's a very uncharted territory I Would say um but we are all ready in it you know it's serious it's also you know we've been talking about the funny\nOr unexpected are weird ways in which these\nBox will affect society but also bad actors can take advantage of these thoughts and turn them into spam machines or other and the various uses and\nAt the moment we are at the mercy of the tech companies to try to design these product in such a way as to minimize their potential for abuse but we just

A. B. N. dot com driven by ... ... ... dot com selling American bestselling brands [noise]\n\nThis is the daily dive weekend edition\nI'm Oscar rumors and we're running down some of the top stories of the week I\nDon't have to check out the daily dive Monday through friday for more news without\nThe noise [laughter]\nFor the ongoing stories that has been happening for a few weeks now is that of the Central American migrants caravan that it's making his way from Honduras there's members from Guatemala and El Salvador as well the Trump Administration is planning to dispatch about eight hundred or more active duty troops to the southern border\nTo help stop the flow of migrants into the country defense secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops of the border bolstering the national guard forces that are already there\nThe additional troops would provide logistical support to the border patrol the plan is not yet been finalized or formerly announced but it is expected to happen for more on the migrant carbon we spoke to Ted has and he's an immigration reporter for Politico and we started off by talking about the president's reaction to the Caribbean and the implications for the midterm elections\nWe've seen the president talked talked on this issue and this is nothing new I mean this goes back to the last time there was a caravan back in April I mean I think the one difference we have here is we're now at the\nDoorstep of November's midterm elections and this was a political issue for him obviously he really wants to make it about his policies and the need for a border wall versus what the Democrats stand for what he characterizes as open borders\nHe's saying that these countries you know Honduras El Salvador Guatemala they're not doing enough to keep these people there I Know Mexico's National Guard there are so you know some military guys they put up a roadblock ate at one point but then they tore down right away\nI guess maybe there was too many people are they knew they weren't gonna be able to handle it the countries are doing something maybe just not enough and like I said now he wants to start cutting eight I think last year these three countries had more than a combined five hundred million dollars in funding from the U.S I think so far this year it's been about two hundred million dollars\nIn aid has been shrinking in recent years to begin with back in twenty Seventeen it was\nSomewhere around seven hundred million to mostly to these three Central American countries Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and then in twenty Eighteen down to six hundred and Fifteen million and now it's been proposed by both the house and the Senate to bring it down somewhere in the five hundred million dollar range and and and the Trump Administration was actually asking for even lower\nSomewhere and four hundred million so even before all this happened President Trump was already proposing to cut aid to the Central American countries so that in itself is nothing new I mean what is interesting though is that he doesn't have an hour to do that on his own right these are bills passed by Congress and Congress will consider what amounts to give in Central American aid when the time comes\nAnd the president being very forceful on this stuff does give some political cover to Republicans who have to push this through because the Democrats are going to be on the opposite side of it with regards to the terms you know he's saying\nWhenever you see these people come across in these criminals and unknown middle Easterners and everything to keep the Democrats in mind we have to change our crappy immigration laws so he makes it about the midterms and everything and he provides a little covered by being forceful but\nIs there not much political will on the part of Congress to do something I I'm there was some immigration bills that tried to pass this past year and none of them went through even some of the ones that the White House was backing\nI mean I think you really need to consider his words in the context of where we are right now and only being two weeks away from the mid term and I think this is the issue that is really important to Republican voters it it\nSeems like it's going up an interest in recent weeks and so for Democrats essentially as a way for them to mobilize their base to get them out to the polls now whether\nAny of these proposals you know border wall slashing funding to Central America rewriting asylum laws I mean these are all really big projects and even maybe a year ago a little less than a year ago when Congress was working in a bipartisan fashion to address them\nThey really struggled to do so and they weren't able to advance any legislation and the White House would pose the bills that had the most support so it's hard to imagine that after the midterms with Democrats likely to take back some ground in the house is not when it entirely that they'd come back to the table and work out a better deal\nWhat has been the reaction from the leaders of these countries Honduras Guatemala El Salvador I Know the Mexican the incoming Mexican president has suggested that the U.S Canada and Mexico work out some\nFunding development for poor areas of Central America in southern Mexico where are these companies trying to do to reduce the type of migration\nThe presidents of the the northern triangle countries were up in Washington DC not too long ago for a summit convened by the U.S and Mexico jointly\nTo talk about these very issues\nAnd you know for the most part they're open to cooperating on security issues but there are clearly limitations in it in some cases those are economic limitations and not having the funding to do it and that's I mentioned before with us funding is being caught towards these kind of projects and Central America right now and then in other cases it's political and it's because of\nPolitical instability in their home country I mean I'm Doris in particular is an example where I'm the president there one Orlando Hernandez is a strong us ally but one\nNarrow reelection and doesn't really have much of a mandate to govern you definitely have different\nLet's say that\nSo you'd hospitals expanding in the U.S trying to shed these old identities we'll see if they gain in popularity thank you Miranda thank you ask a [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAlways has to be favorite story of the week I'm a Southern California guy I grew up here and I love Disneyland I Love going there\nIt is one of the happiest places on the earth and we found this article in the wall Street Journal about the big secret that Disney World and Disneyland have\nThat it's a favorite spot for people to scatter the ashes of their family members once they've passed these think it's like one of the ultimate tributes that you could have their Miranda real quick if you were going to have your ashes spread it isn't and where would you have them spread it\nProbably Indiana Jones 'cause that's my favorite\nRight I Would go on space mountain and I just want somebody to throw me up in the air so that it gets all over everyone and everything I worried they're going to sweep you let the end of the night that's what happens actually so\nWe spoke to Eric Schwartz all he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal and he spoke to several families who have actually done this they were very forthright about it they snuck the ashes and they spread them out in different places Disneyland holds a really special place in a lot of people's hearts and it just makes sense that people would want to\nHave it be their final resting place oh here's ... with more about the big secret from Disneyland\nI'm so glad to hear you say that it made a lot of sense to you and made a lot of sense to me too I thought that I'd ever thought about but whenever I heard that this was a popular place it spread ashes it was like oh of course people love going to Disneyland it makes sense that some would want to spend eternity there and when I started talking to the custodians who work in both parks\nThey told me Oh yes it's very much a thing of always been these rumors about it but it does happen\nAnd it so much to the point that they have a code word for it or they say it's a habit clean up so\nIf you are a worker who sees what you suspect are human ashes maybe left on the seat of a ride or something like that you radio over and you say we have a habit clean up and that means\nYou need to grab the hype ... vacuum because the custodians will then come by and if they do indeed identified the substance of human ashes they will come up in a vacuum and clean it up all everyone you know leaves the premises and goes on to other rights before they can come back\nDisney custodian say that it happens about once a month that they actually notice it it could be happening a lot more so that's a lot of frequency\nWe were talking about a really quick about how much it makes sense that people would want this to be part of their final resting place\nIn the article you you detail somebody who said that they would go to Disneyland with their dad and he worked like the graveyard shift but when he was at Disneyland he was a completely different person happy go lucky and she was like can we stay here forever so it really means\nSomething to a lot of people to be in this location give us a couple of examples of how people are spreading these ashes like what are they doing and you know where are they doing it all that stuff\nI spoke with six families who have spread ashes at Disney Parks and they do follow a bit of a pattern they know they're not supposed to do it so they have to get creative\nSeveral of them smuggle the ashes in prescription pill bottles you know I've talked to one woman who said you know she had the very surreal experience of empty and her father's earn in a hotel bathroom into a pill bottle that she could then smuggle\nPath park security while others will simply put them in Ziploc bags and put them at the bottom of a purse or an ...\nThat that's gone through security as well and then once they're inside if they want to maybe spread it on a specific ride they might wait until the rights particularly dark so no one sees them other times they'll just go to a flower bed or a part of the park that doesn't seem like there are a lot of people around\nNow I did speak with one woman who's in the story who in two thousand nine for the ashes of her mother and at one point while she was doing it she was sort of overcome with grief and she hopped over the barricade surrounding the lawn outside Cinderella Castle\nAnd ran across the grass Fleming Loma she ran why and it's a pretty dramatic statement and she says no one stopped her and I have\nPhotos of sit there and I just saw the you know so so it definitely happen and so it's like wow if if someone running across Cinderella lawn for a ashes\nDoesn't get notice I mean I Can't imagine how many people do this and never get caught but you're right that in talking to custodians the consensus that I arrived that would that have happened about once a month but I've heard stories of it happening more\nFrequently heard stories of there being some downtime where they might not have one for a while but in my story alone I had six examples ranging from Nineteen Ninety six to last week\nHow did you find these people like how did they come forward I mean I I think the ... says that if anybody is caught doing this there'll be escorted off property but I don't think there's been any arrests or anything related to this house so how did these people come forward to you\nThere haven't been any arrests that we know of the Anaheim police department says they couldn't recall any arrests being made on this kind of thing [noise] you know the people that I spoke to they were pretty public about the fact that they had spread ashes at Disney so\nProbably it was one of pride that you know at this point\nYeah it's a point of pride it's also I should say like even though I think most of them found a bit of a bit of humor and the whole act they they definitely it was an extremely emotional experience and something that they also saw and interpreted as honoring their loved ones final wishes\nSo it was something that they were really touched by an and actually quite eager to share with me\nYou've touched a little bit on where the U.S\nAre these ashes a lot of times flower beds Bush is on the lawns outside even in the park gates [laughter]\nLove the quote someone said that the hunting mansion probably has so much human ashes in it that it's not even funny and that's one of those places obviously we know what the hunted mentioned right is all about spooky and whatnot and it's like the perfect places to drop the ashes it gives the all new meaning you know the next time I'm going to be there I'm going to be like trying to look for human ashes there\nWell I take that as the ultimate compliment I mean I think the I think I heard\nSo many examples that I can say safely say that human ashes have been spread all over these parks the hunted mansion is definitely the most popular destination but it's a small world also had quite a strong showing based mountain pirates of the Caribbean I mean really if you think about it they're probably been human ashes spread there\nAnd I don't quite know why they ... the hunted Manchin is\nSo I mean obviously it's on theme right for the practice but in talking to people who work in a hunting mansion they describe just to sort of general obsession among certain fans with the haunted mansion I also think that it's probably strategically a pretty good spot because it's very dark\nAnd there are a lot of places where you can sort of in conspicuously into it\nKnowing this now gives all these rides new meaning when they find ashes and they have to go through the process of locating it cleaning it up\nThey'll close the rides and say they're closer technical difficulties and I've always seen rides closed for technical difficulties before could be something mechanical but this is also one of those other reason so what's that process when they identify what they think it is and then how do they go through about cleaning\nIt has a process that will kick start on rights like the haunted mansions so safe or ride comes around people leave and they see some what they think are are human ashes on the seats they will clear out the premises do radio over for a clean up\nThey often do you tell people that there are technical difficulties that they need to attend to and then they will head out fast passes\nTo people because you know you're standing in line for an hour and then suddenly they said the right to shut down and you have to leave you gotta give 'em something wrong with people are going to get upset so then the the vacuum and it's come in and they suck it up you know in a manager will often ride the ride by themselves so that they can look in the like are there any\nAshes anywhere in the rye that we need to go in identifying and sweep up and then resume business\nA number of the people I spoke to also dumped ashes in the water of these rights icon pirates and on it's a small world so the water I think it's probably a pretty impossible place to to discover it you're not going to see that especially in some of those darker rides\nYeah I mean it's a really fun read it's perfect for Halloween ... reporter for the wall Street Journal thank you very much for joining us\nA thank you and if you do see any ashes on the hunter mansion please call me so I can do a follow up it definitely was a great thank you\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nThat's a threat to this weekend be sure to check out the daily diet every Monday through friday joined us on social media

if they were not paid\nBy the simple fact remains\nDemocrats in America are at risk\nTo save them to protect them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me your host Rush Limbaugh and the ... [noise] now the uh the bomb here in the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise]\nI guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing to show me right so Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they start sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn aide to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy range is is [noise] I mean [noise] the elevator doesn't go to the top floor like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\n\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to win the election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think and all ... what's going on barring a the\nRevelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people trashing Republicans in airports and at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try it out over\nWell I'm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans to other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just spreading hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work\nIf all of that backfired and leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it okay let's\nGet some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average\nAll of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it is not\nThere is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how we described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats they're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there\nGOP can hold the house so all\nOf this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise] and Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue\nNow another retired historian and political analyst sends an email\nThat I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have it but it just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that said I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passionately this guy\nWho is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known\nAs he looks at things he uses an absolute red wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to\nConvert any of these trends are the actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is craze wearing the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nBut it corny corny corny it could go either direction Democrats can still win big or they could lose big it going to ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have that reputation as all of a sudden\nIt could be really really close much\nCloser than we ever ever knew gets a cycle and you can

was never any attempt for these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right or a to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered the Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply\nNo load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's whoa it tell\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\n\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is gonna be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic\nOperative or a Democrat\nIn cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow Republicans to use this caravan

what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the health of east um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you know what you're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and got my slippers that kinda thing\nRight it was a point it was a plant it ... it was all the it was all nonsense to garner empathy and said it was\nPlans to go to waste it was this plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct in the sun I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle Milky came out with the fifties and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was the plan and it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons a great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences\nAnd there are no are you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who's open the door for last being shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy\nTheorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense and I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I've never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons is there are no coincidence is with them as soon as I say this is a philosophy that I have stalled for four years on this program\nAsking people to never forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say these are all deep state players are sorrows bill and Hillary or Obama and so forth\nUm if it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid terms when you get down to it other than they're trying to\nGet themselves on the radar but see that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need\nTo be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody's gonna he can still move the needle you working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts I used to the rush to actually store open up you know with some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I were to tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us she said you know I could never say this outside this a little bigger but I\nI have\nFor everything you do on my family I Can't help but I find you the most compelling most interesting guy\nThat I haven't run across I wanted to meet you for I don't know how long 'cause you're the kind of guy you know I I've I I was a liberal arts inside I Need to feel like a woman I haven't been made to feel like you know why I'm so sorry understand\nCould you make me feel

weekend [noise] and of course who is this week talking what am I saying [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may even if it's sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nAnd that may yet happened down that road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electorate hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't like that or an infant didn't want to last and so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite\nEverything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking\nWe we've got how many two thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance in Arizona is around two thousand miles\n\nSeven thousand people one day just decided\nTo start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this would be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so\nYou've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it seven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles we don't\nSee pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people chewing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street I mean it got maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human the fate [noise]\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with ...\nRemember they're vowing to get her I just hit the southern border may cause they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean it's it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand\n[noise] and then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined by a second the caravan\nThan we are just hearing about Fox News in the a P report to the second the caravan of illegal immigrants has formed in Honduras and has already\nCrossed into Guatemala they're hoping to catch up to the main group\nThe massive my grand caravan Bush's during the southern us border a second group of about one thousand people from Honduras is rushing to join the main group which reportedly and swelled its ranks with several people who've already been to Fort in the caravan

Chula the smaller group trailing entered walk them my love from Honduras late Sunday\nApply for asylum in the first place that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none\nOf this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives\nAre multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this article left I think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it\nMay well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this was the left behind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold [laughter]\nWe already have to you about the traffic\nBecause we're settlers and that's what we do we settled for not being far [noise] settle for wearing Dr clothing and dying at age twenty nine from I\nThe valleys place to talk [noise]\nYour grave as soon as we can\nWKBD in\nSecond Life if you will be held in Pittsburgh and more of the victims of yesterday's shooting massacre the tree of life synagogue ABC's aerial Russia in Pittsburgh\nThe Jewish community across the globe has been rocked by this targeted killing Jewish organizations from around the world have sat representative and labor leaders to Pittsburgh to provide comfort and support interfaith leaders are also expressing their solidarity\nRobert Bauer is expected to have an initial court appearance tomorrow is wounded it might have an audio video link set up at his hospital bed side former FBI agent known ABC News contributor Brad Garrett on questions to be investigated\nThat he is the serial bomber that we just went through as a motivator I don't know with their anger and rage builds up and it's all about power\nPittsburgh city councilmember Corey O'Connor says the issue of mass shootings needs to be taken on head on\nThat community were very diverse we're not going to be afraid of that [noise] um we were out and about in the thousands last night we're going to be all about today of secrets\nIn ABC News [noise]\nOur next just data five just ahead more stimulating talk from the old Charlie digital studios\nNine Ninety nine menu nine great meals one great price oh Charlie\nBird and probably present the introduction of the Mahoney valley's most affordable line\nOf hot tubs the cost has low was forty two dollars per month just forty two dollars a month\nFor an all new fantasy far from the makers of hot springs portable five only Burnett bulls can make relaxation Vince affordable these incredible hot tubs include plug in wage acknowledging that said ... you got to stop in today\nAnd see this new line of affordable boss what are you waiting for\nThe all new fantasy FAA as low as forty two dollars a month bring fresh ... and most of all relax get more details today at Burnett fools dot com or visited convenient location near you\nCan feel Cortland Newcastle just forty dollars a month and a new ... is all your only ... odd to\n\nBe left out in the cold this winter called magic heating in Gerard your factory authorized Brian dealer\nWas Dorjee twenty seven forecasts scattered showers today a high forty eight and I was forty chance of showers on Monday with a highly April Barclay money do they can't put a challenge late in the day and I to be a good\nTemperature forty seven five Seventy W.

bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill ... says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who on their right mind would promote this would want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once cakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nBut at the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young\nWho haven't lived long enough to know what's best for being driven solely by a motion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and said to the world come on it\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nDemocratic Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they

up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it a into a course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this pump pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution and governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is an ... what is what is seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and left to seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized as the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or tear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly and so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own he leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if

that divides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows when he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump\nIs ... is working is spending golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment
