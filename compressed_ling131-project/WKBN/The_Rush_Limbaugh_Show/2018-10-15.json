it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night\nTrump and Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less me still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we got on the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell him about my opinions of the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said\n\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but\nIt all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he

class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to income taxes now which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers the\nTop point zero zero one\nPercent the top one one hundredth of a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone pain free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little round that to fourteen hundred\nFor teen hungry tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\n\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent of the top one thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this is\nAs it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll it'd be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything\nYou need the votes of the people in the bottom ... percent so you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than you or is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share of taxes

marks that everyone has either on oppressor press there either bourgeois proliferated\nIts later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are [noise] it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp for the other\nIs spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nThat action out of the\nGreat on wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in the language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes intersection out on the couch and it's basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that your friends are leftist organizations somewhere they with each other the famine is taboo this strain about them that that that uh\nUh cohabitation with a with militant or a Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activism and we're all of these people intersect is worried that unifies\nYes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressed\nOr or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was a recent white privilege stuffed ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty

controversies Trump's tweets and the investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election\n[noise] their story says that the White House should be hiring more staff to handle a congressional inquiries advising administration officials to retain their own lawyers and researching potential areas of vulnerability ranging from the death of four soldiers in Africa to the sluggish
