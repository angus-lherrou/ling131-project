to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation andme merger\nBecause Joe ... show he was wearing an apple walk\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan that she had instructions to call\nA man I've got his name here I'm not going to bother to look it up she had the structures to call somebody if he didn't come back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized wicked married a fiance that's waiting outside in the family sit down and she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something\nCould happen are reporting that he was ... was recording everything\nThat happened folks is not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch\nCould have worked independently of his phone now there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch it's just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards is Bluetooth that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think on the golf course when I lose the range of phones stop talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of that which would be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and transmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of\nWhat happened to us besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off a and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it the watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that\nCan operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start yeah you can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part has to stream them it's not an independent device so the there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt [noise] well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be\nAt some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch would need to be back in close proximity the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it's it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the family said Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh

Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state of what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project beret toss it Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nVery task news have been reported\nSo we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News and oats you report back

one drive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is as McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get\nElected we\nCan't\nOpenly says that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project maritime us secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the end the project maritime ... secret journalist they're talking about the second amendment\nFamously here I mean I think we can actually win or getting in on our members are a horn\n[laughter]\nWhere are you able to hear that\nAre you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt okay All right let me go let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense\nOf that or even though I've got a direct

can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows\nHe just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are\nTotal NRA folks the Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\n\nI voted for getting rid of ... what what about high capacity magazine I
