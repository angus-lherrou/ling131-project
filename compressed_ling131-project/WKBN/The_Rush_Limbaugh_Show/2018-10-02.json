I understand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why don't we have to use\nIn order to win I never understood that why do we have to lose\nKavanaugh in order to gin up turning out I I [noise] depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and I go to the voters say we're in a majority we tried we tried but we couldn't get anything from you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the\n... and there's a disconnect there [noise] anybody\nEver heard the name Chris Dean watcher named Christine fair Dr Carroll Christine fair\nAnybody heard of her [noise] let me tell you who she is she is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown Georgetown's not an insignificant university\nGeorgetown has the same Georgetown University was the nucleus the center of the movement to give\nA women as much contraceptive help as possible birth control pills as far as I could see Georgetown was the center of that movement\nAnd this ...

something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show the digital camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see if there\nAre but first before I assure you there's there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a southern angry voices on the right\nSpeaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right in Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out and there's no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still ... four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed angry voices on the road for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nUh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going to accept that were challenged the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia\nShortwave radio is is that by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have\nThat I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick\nThat was his name drew up\nA cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted artist did his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public at the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it\nSwitched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we\nHave the ability to show these things rather than describe them same cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vile\nIt's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting it's despicable ended sick and of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people would say that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weigh whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor\nOn the left\nThis is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin ... says another prayer dear\nGod forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established\nAs anywhere near true [noise] and it's just it flies in the face of of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\n\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some\nOpposite so don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media have so much invested in their power in their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some\nTo the quick it disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did\nOn CNN NBC News desperately trying to convict capital at the same

be redundant\nBut Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this afternoon bringing up the fact that we need to start looking a gathered his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive\nHealth and is assault

the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon Whitehouse is number not Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged\nPages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he sought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want to say Sam investigation\nI also think that there's a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to uh get the sun by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nChuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have grab audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtles in\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get the robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh perjuring\nYourself and that means he's not caught on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape just nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nIs a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear that guy's got a lot of short and we can get this done\nThat's just to central\nMaybe White Houses out their\nTruck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more [noise] that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou know this this is of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners to the gym judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about him and said that she had it
