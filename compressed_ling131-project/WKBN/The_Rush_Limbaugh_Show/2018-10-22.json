radio\nWhy don't you may be a young man I'm Scott ...\nMuch as the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters mines so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent male ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be covering it\nAnd building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hip hid it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's hadn't been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about sending a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the narrative and didn't want it to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\nAs elected still\nTo the United states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October

bill hammer and ... with this morning bill ... says Mike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned of these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them we're also deeply conservative violence provoked by some members of the group as well\nAs the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of and by the way the the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my ego claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow is it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night\nHow was it raising the stakes to point out what's happening especially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho when their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who won the right mind would promote this one wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo\nGoes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nBut in the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons\nThis country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven solely by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to helping benefit from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculus\nIt is that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd so the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls that the Democrats\nThis is the home of ... tried five Seventy W Katie and\n[noise] I'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN\nPlaying an impartial ... invited me to make it look like I was trying to make the case that can show you deserve to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said the fact the exact opposite so yeah yeah\nA lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or if the court same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWhere you can use the military because a positive comments out is look that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what Woodrow Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think dogs trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized just a border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back in the emergency session and do a national address and\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bringing back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you'd think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leads to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it is it a whole lot of different ways\nWill be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get

and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\n\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nHow many of you by the way how many have you joined a crowd of of of of Seventy five thousand people at a Seventeen or Eighteen thousand seat venue and yes they do I wouldn't I wouldn't if I drop by and saw the crowd that been from the get go home watch it on TV [noise] try\nOkay back to the phones we go to a voting\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well that's great have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called it with a lotta years military are retired from the Marines although we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this\nIs not a military invasion and talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife well my I let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but\nThat wouldn't be enough okay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem but you don't you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot that the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down to squeal and like a pig and then it so we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the presence would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nPut words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong\nInterpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they are good that they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nThat that's still a lot older than you thought they wish that we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the preparation we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario than okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound and since I don't mean that they\nHold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings what somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to want to tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably with Bush or talking about members of the the immigrant illegally but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got to hit that it was storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they're meant the strikes are we just have to\nLike even if there is a casualty or to the drive buys hamper story Trump away luxury fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd they're still parents yeah\nOkay so the alternative is still a lot of men\nNo no I have to hold a lot it and like I said you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the political legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't

they haven't this is just I don't believe that smokes\nThese people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and the irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now Bible showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he debated Ron dissent this last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the winning Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida\nAs a collective that's communist ...

you live in Florida and Texas\nThe economies are growing like gang busters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down this is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist\nWho doesn't want there to be and the private sector success because the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd\nYou didn't build that you didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott's the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santas would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people who want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses\nBusinesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because it'll like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump\nTo support it because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want\nIf you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states being caused there deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever\nElse is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this are you better at running your life\nIs the government better at running your life\nThe Democratic party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me and and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home\nPeople sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified as personify the exact total\nWrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ... I don't know where this was a chance to just grab some pictures here on the fly to break in the top of the hour\nThere are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see a second look a high school gym and nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw\nAnd give them is sitting there with somebody else in there watching bite and speak and there's no excitement in his room there's nothing anywhere near what happens if a Trump rally but these people believe that ... is the answer\nTrial of the people charged and murder I'm Shannon grades will now be heard max spraying and my new jibes today was actually supposed to have\nStart of our tour on No Child he's accused of killing grains who disappeared almost two years ago only to be found dismembered in ... in a freezer\nAnd Campbell home a year ago in Columbia county in the Centers for Disease Control has confirmed case of the ... than in children that mimics polio the CDC and the department of health have confirmed a total of four cases in Ohio\nDrivers laughter starts falling down and easy crash prone rather in my dining ... high department transportation says ...
