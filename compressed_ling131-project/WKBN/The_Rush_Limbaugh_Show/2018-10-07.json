obviously that digital ... ballots to deal with those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have the need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter that

reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I it's even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex I fill many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be reached traumatizing to revisit that to tell people go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody once this law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there um you're telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be read traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blamed themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so there's a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often but sometimes a there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong\nI went to that party I had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not\nAnd so there's that self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be beliefs of the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive my trauma and no one's and I'm going to do it publicly people now know these shameful details it's you know sex as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical ... they're visible press that um something happened to me\nLet's talk about the victims you actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives tumbling at all that does that make it that much more complicated\nYes especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are and so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation I'm but you're also scared of being ostracized ostracized so\nUh you know will people again in this victim blaming society what people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we ... so someone says hey this person you know\nTo me what if we know that person to be a really good person and I can't get might just the bystander I Can't get my mind around the idea that this person that I Know to be upstanding and the community suddenly something horrible is being said he did\nUm I don't know the standard way to dry it I mean I literally just took a paper towel

that'll do it for this hour for Jennifer ... Gordon Deal thanks for listening to this weekend\n[noise]\n\n\nTo all this research we had to do for this segment and since the dawn of the Cold War they've been trying to figure out the best way to reach the most amount of citizens and let them know have\nSomething terrible is about to happen and like you said it's been a long strange history the first one that they developed was in the early fifties and at the time they called it ... which was a mixture of the words\nControl of electromagnetic radiation and what this would do was upon activation\nOf this warning system all the radio stations across the country would either shut down or switch formats over to broadcasting from the same two channels and it would be a recorded message from a guy who was a TV personality at the time and best friends with President Eisenhower Arthur Godfrey and he was a trusted voice he wouldn't record this public\nService announcement and there are no copies of his audio by the way I Love that very mysterious into and basically just warning everybody to stay calm and that Americans will survive whatever the nuclear war is going to happen like\nKind of like what happens now with the emergency alert system just a voice comes on and says hey it's an emergency become et cetera et cetera but this one was just funny because it was tied to TV personality oh Arthur Godfrey yeah so that was early on in the fifties and then another system that they had which I kind of thought was totally ineffective and I guess that's why they cancel it\nWas they were setting up this system of ... and pink balloons what was that\nThey did it in a really small concentration because this was just a test so this was never anything that was major Lee rolled out but in a small town of Charlotte, Michigan which happens to be near a civil defense agency headquarters at the time they set up with five hundred warning\nGenerators and with us they distributed to just over like a thousand devices to everybody in\nThe town and they were to plug this in to one of their electrical outlets and then when they did the test of the system basically all the outlets started buzzing yeah\nAnd you were to go I guess your back yard and release of pink balloon and that pink balloons are supposed to signify that something terrible had happened\nI mean that's a totally crazy you can't trust people to be reliable enough to do that but it was supposed to alert Ninety percent of the country within thirty seconds that something crazy was going on but there is no message attached to it it's just been balloons that means\nMass hysteria would break out so they cancel that program 'cause it was going to be totally ineffective and then around the time of mixing there was a new system that they're trying to get set up\nRichard Nixon and LBJ wanted to develop their own version of it and which they called the decision information distribution system than ... device and what this was is it something that you can plug into your TV like think about a fire stick\nIn the seventies basically the same concept and so you plug into your TV and what it would do was change the channel if you had some kind of warnings that from Washington they would get on all the TVs and ... automatically change the channel to everybody'd be watching the same program informing you of what's going on it\nBut at the same exact time that this was happening and this is what's leading as to what happened yesterday the public lost all trust with the government because of what happened with Watergate and they were very concerned about government having direct access to something that was inside their homes\nAnd as you said people were kind of mad they don't want the president to be able to bust your phone whenever he wants\nTo just to clarify if not the president's sitting in his office and saying I'm going to say now this alert no ... there was a process that goes through he does have to direct FEMA to send it out so there's a whole process behind it you know after that in the eighties they settled on the emergency broadcast system the one that we all know takes over television and everything like that\nSo you know there's this long history that we have in this country of these emergency broadcast system\nThis was a new one I think it's actually a good idea everybody always has their cell phones on it were hyper connected you get notifications on your phone you can turn on TV and obviously if something's breaking it's gonna be on a news station\nBut it is good to have something direct when you're in your car you're just walking out for a hike it's good to have it come to you personally it's really about how to use it and then obviously what the emergency is hopefully aliens don't invade us\nRight in the event that something were to happen and we get these alerts they say Americans have about eight to twelve minutes to seek shelter before something\nHappens and in a life threatening situation that could help we just don't want to mess it up like Hawaii did the last time so I didn't come back talk was half forgot about that there is among strange history of emergency alerts thanks Miranda thank you out there and\nYou're listening to the daily diving weekend edition I'm Oscar rumors and we'll be right back with more [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] well come back to the daily dive weekend edition\nNext up is my favorite story of the week really I Love stories about bank robbers and bank robberies it takes a special person to have to go through all this stuff to finally come in and say I want to Rob a bank and then research and figure out how you're going to do it this guy in particular has an interesting story\nHe won the lottery hit it big one Ninety million dollars\nAnd then blew through all of it he fell from the highest of highs\nAnd out of desperation turned to robbing banks Miranda you were actually lived in the area where some of the stuff was going around\nI miss Santa Clarita native and I think like five out of his eight or nine banks that he hit were in that town and that's my home town so that's all anybody was talking about on Facebook for weeks was this peachy crews are banned it it was completely captivating and I'm ready for like the Martin Scorsese as he good fellas style movie about this guy\nI remember seeing a lot of news stories about it when it's happening locally especially for you you know you think\nHave I ever run into that guy have I seen that getaway car and that's why they named him to peachy crews are bad at it was his getaway car use the stolen money that he got from the bags to buy this getaway car so we spoke to Natalie O'Neill she's a contributor to the Daily Beast and we started off by asking who was the P. T. crews are banned it Jim have\nFour kids have was a security guard who back in the late nineties one night the million dollar and the California state lottery [laughter] and then over the course of the next decade sort of amazingly I managed to\nLose it all and then after losing it all came out\nPretty accessible bank robber got away with ten of 'em in the LA area before he wouldn't then caught by the FBI last year\nSo I just had been talking with Hanna prison al and writing letters so he kinda ended up telling me everything that happened in between the time that he won the lottery and started kind of life of crime\nMy first question here is how do you strike up a relationship with a former bank robber guy in prison how do you broach the subject of tell me your story\nI called his lawyer and we had gotten her pour lawyer then told me you know I\n... going to be the kind of guy wouldn't mind telling his story so why don't you send him a letter in prison and he was up for it he had already pled guilty I think it was waiting for\nSentencing hearing at the point that eye contact with him so he basically before we started talking wanted I wanted to wait until he had been sentenced in K ... than the article came out that he felt like you know maybe made him look bad so basically I just wrote him a really personal handwritten letter saying hey\nI Am fascinated by what

we're running down some of the top stories of the week [noise] don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday or more news without the noise [laughter]\nNobel Prizes were also being awarded this past week\nOne of the more interesting Nobel Prize is awarded was for that in Madison physiology or medicine and went to two people Dr James Alison and test Sudoku hung Joe for discoveries that led to a new way to treat cancer by targeting the body's immune system rather than the tumors themselves\nA it's led to a host of new drugs him you know therapy it's quite expensive but\nPeople are saying that it works pretty well on a certain types of lung cancer and melanoma which is a form of skin cancer so for this story we spoke to Peter loft is he's a reporter for the wall Street Journal we started off by asking who were these Nobel Prize winners James Alison and test to ...\nBoth of them have specialized in immunology studying the body's immune system this turned out to be a critical\nPart of what they discovered and to put it in context if you think about the mainstay of cancer treatment over the years things like chemotherapy and radiation which were effective are effective in certain situations but\nBut it can also be blunt instruments in the sense that they can destroy healthy cells in the body along with cancer cells so that causes that causes all sorts of complications going back about Fifteen Twenty years there was another ... advance in cancer treatment and that was the target genetic mutation\nIn cancer cells now this immune based approaches sort of the new wave and one of the more significant approaches to treating cancer and a long time these two scientists working separately but in parallel discovered features about the body's immune system that led them to figure out that if used certain kinds of drugs\nTo target immune system cells in a certain way it'll basically better equipped to the body's own immune system to go after and destroy cancer cells\nSo exactly how does it work I was reading a lot about checkpoints and how a lot of this stuff let's T cells basically attack the cancer cells it's T cells are form of white blood cells and this is where the magic really comes through in\nThat I mean what's so interesting about what they discovered was that the body's immune\nSystem has sort of its own natural checkpoints or break so that it doesn't go overboard and attack the healthy parts of the body cancer cells have basically figure it out how to exploit that and so they in some way they sort of latch on to the break about his immune system\nIn a way that helps and escape describing destruction and so these drugs\nThat have come out of the research from both scientists essentially take breaks off all the body's own immune system to go after cancer cells in a way that they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise\nSome of the drugs that have been able to be developed because of their research I've seen these like ... you know commercials for these on TV a key true to end up even though I think it was former President Jimmy Carter who said that he used to be true to to treat his melanoma and it worked out very well for him\nI think a lot of people have become aware of them through those things may be hearing about Jimmy Carter taking the true to an yes with TV commercials now are promoting the use of TiVo and keep true to I think primarily lung\nCancer because lung cancer is one of the more common types of cancers and then one of the most deadly these drones has shown some promise\nThe research still obviously continues they're finding out that these things help treat those things but you know it's not a hundred percent success rate so the next step is to find out why it works the way it does work and then who would benefit most from it there's also a costing somebody's immune therapies can cost upwards of a hundred grand per person so\nThat has to be figured out as well but Dr ... himself as even said this is a work in progress\nBut he you know confident in his own work in progress of these treatments says by the end of the century cures could be found or you know just even more therapies can be developed to help out with this stuff\nFor the studies have shown that as welcoming\nAs these drugs are and as much as they represent an advance\nThe extra alone I think for the most part only works in a minority of\nPatients that we see that in the study what's striking to doctors about these drugs is that in that minority patients that can have a lasting effect that can help people live in some cases for years so the trick now is to try to better predict in which patients these drug will work and\nBy doing things like ... Singh tumors and then also studying different combinations of the drugs to see if like two or three of them together can do better than one alone and\nAs you mentioned I mean you mentioned the cost that approach is going to compound the cost factor in the sense that you had there are huge drug alone is relatively expensive and so combining them just going to be even more of a financial burden\nThese are effects that we're seeing that from things that they've been doing for eight years beyond that even you know longer than that that they've been looking into this stuff specifically Dr Alison the American and he has a very intimate relationship with cancer of family members had cancer he had a bout with cancer it's been around him for a long time\nOut of the colony and this is really parliamentary research but what they're thinking is that it was actually acting as a kind of\nNervous system of itself so it's actually replacing the nervous system\nOf the ... so it might be releasing neurotransmitters that mimic those of the ... owned by to actually manipulate individual muscles so it's like a puppet master\nPolling strength and that's just it's stunning how this could have involved but it probably happened small that by small that it started more simple than that of course but these extra manipulations how the fungus propagate it ... into more and and that's what led to the developed with is extremely complex\nManipulation but nevertheless is happening\nI can guarantee that happening is ... you know it's happening out there and ...\nNow it's kind of crazy it takes about three weeks for the fungus to grow with inside the end and you talk about how I mean it's so crazy how delicate this procedure is because you know ... living this colony when they noticed something is a mess and another and sicker stumbling are acting weird\nAnother ... will literally come and take it pick it up and throw it down to it to death you know away from the colony protecting the colony so the fungus has to be very careful that it doesn't trigger something weird in the end that it it's going to trigger one of the other answer and suspected of being some type of intruder\nSo how does that work how does the funniest delicately moving around\nAt the very end as you said when it makes it go bite the leaf or the tree branches something that's the point that takes over the brain kind of but before that the end is still operating normally in within the colony\nYeah that that's a really cool thing about ... you know I I don't want to to\nThe short them on credit here they're really good at as you said at a sniffing out their own that happened to be sick because you want to quarantine those individuals\nBefore they wreak havoc on the rest of the call anyone of that a path to the end of the fungus or some other sort of disease that thing that has a fall over many millions of years and ants which then as you mentioned the fungus hassle\nThan skirt so that's probably why this is such a complex manipulation so that scientists aren't quite sure yet how\nIt's able to avoid detection because answer really good at sniffing out pheromones that's how they communicate and largely find their way around it somehow the fungus ended up taking over about half\nOf the body weight of the ant which you would assume would smell a little different than a typical and so because they have\nThis really intricate unique system of sniffing out bad actors\nIn the colony that's probably why the fungus is so complex that it probably started out killing the ants a long time ago millions upon millions of years ago this is in fact that they found a fossil that are many millions of years old of leaves with the characteristic bite marks of the aunt in them which presume that the fungus had\nBeen doing this for a long time so it probably start out pretty sort kills the and in the colony but that might get it found out in that would get it dragged out of the colony and into the graveyard where you just stick and go\nI Love the way you put it in the article to it has to drive its host mad yet not mad enough to raise the alarms in the colony\nExactly so yeah and you know and it doesn't really show the symptoms and doesn't really show symptoms until it is literally stumbling out of the colony as the fungus ordering it to its doom up you know ten inches up a tree so this is as I mentioned this was an incredibly complex manipulation it doesn't seem\nPossible but that is the beauty of natural selection evolution over\nMillions upon millions of years this has grown increasingly complex\nBecause the ant colony is itself extremely complex and able to sniff out the sort of manipulation is the end is acting at all weird so that is all the more pressure on the fungus to a ball to avoid detection and really pull off this\nStunningly complex devious manipulation\nThat's how we get the zombie I mean here it's so delicate that process in infiltrating the colony and even half the time it right the you know the fungus as a time it right so that when the end is leaving the colony that's when it releases all the chemicals and finally taken over the brain\nTo make it go ten inches up and fight the leaf and everything is just so interesting how these things work and you were saying earlier it does ah originate in the rain forest but there are some here in the United states as well in a South Carolina I think uh we have a at\nA certain type of this fungus as well\nYeah and that's where it gets if you can believe it all the more credible because\nIn some of the United states you of course have trees that will shed their leaves once a year and that of course would be bad for the fungus if the fungus was ordering the ...\nTo bite onto the pain of at least that means it's going to tumble out of the tree and lose its perch above the colony so what has happened here in the southern United States as well as other temperate climates around the world is\nThe fungus doesn't order the antibody onto the vein of elite but instead\nThe branch are quick which is a perch that it can maintain year round even as the leaves fall off the tree the problem there is that that's a little bit more delicate of a purchase easier ticket a purchase on the vein of elite by biting into it so that actually happens here in the states as as the\nFungus there's ordering the ... to bite onto the swag it's not such a good purchase\nBut then orders the answer rap its legs around the twigs and then grows as the fungus grows out of the legs and kind of attached to them to that stem\nAnd that just all the more power to to purchase there and you know get a good grasp because\nIn the temperate climate the fungus can't develop nearly as quickly as it does in the rain forests where it's nice and warm and humid and actually developed over the course of a year and it will over winter just sitting there on the stem biding his time and then once the spring comes around it will then finally arrived out of the back of the head\nOf the ... as it does in the rain forest whereas you know in the rain forest a dozen and a number of days as opposed to once upon month so it's really fascinating how in different parts of the world the fungus is uniquely adapted to really ruin that day you know the answer and in a very unique way\nIt's such a creepy cool story and I've seen the picture of the fungus growing out of the ... and it looks pretty crazy wearing a link to your article this is all part of a book that you wrote called plight of the living dead tell us about the book\nYeah so that turns out that the fungus is just one of the\nMany many manipulators among parasites in the animal kingdom so it turns out that this is across different species the worms do it to crickets their war or to the crickets the jump into water which is not of course great for the credit which can drown or you can buy fish and it's at that point the worms are up and then ...\nThat's a particular kind of manipulation\nRabies actually is a very well known parasitic manipulated that does it usually to raccoons and ... and things like that but can also get into the human brain so\nThe book is about the wide range of parasites the\nReally incredible range of parasites more than you would ever imagined that can take over the minds of their hosts and really unique ways whether that's by releasing chemicals or physically altering\nStructures in the brain so called living dead and yes it's it's a what I Hope they're fascinating exploration have this very strange kingdom of species that are really ruining the days of their house\nJust reading about the ants in of itself is so interesting so thank you very much Matt Simon staff writer at

mean that's the only thing are in [noise]\nAnd a man my visiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking\nWould have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they\nPlayed right along without had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what the purpose was a all\nTrump is still is reminding everybody\nWhat she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is is it is not mocking\nChristie involves the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when\nHe said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet\nAs a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at the moon to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed\nI don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished that after he makes it an initial statement on something if he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell\nYou how ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and try up I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with\nRage other Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do\nThis and pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine an organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush ... women are nor do the research we\nWell yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even

[noise]\n\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review readings and welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books here is the is the James moved up to the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics may know I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIt's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it it's what the\n... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise]\nOccupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate that's sick\n... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening\nHere and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case can be capital that's how they're going to be heard rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with\nBlack lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in on the fairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this the Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never that range and the angered never\nEnds it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally get\nDoesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had Woolsey forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mock she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nSo Rahm I'm Alone and fall out they're attacking Trump is via look back on Dr Ford\nThey call I'm Don King day this is the guy that line\nFor many years about serving with bravery and honor in Vietnam money and never ever been there\nHe literally claim that people were dying all around it but at a year and his platoon kept doing their job he was never dare to guys that's sick all he's up pathological liar he got called on other people or Connecticut still elected the guy we used to be the attorney general state now he's a senator\nI call him a Rambo [noise] ramble Blumenthal\nAnd I wish he would just sit in his office in playing with his GI Joe dolls and be quiet but no he's out there claiming that Trump's violent attack on Dr Ford disrespected the entire survivor\nCommunity we have a survivor community now\n[noise]\nA survivor of man community now is on CNN\nAnd here it is this is they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was a flight out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that may be the president for the markings are like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski man by the way they voted needs are do you think your president for maybe should they not done it\nThe president was skating the facts I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was standing facts that were given during Dr forts testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to qualify to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly why can't challenged her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go just to do it Trump did it\nIn yeah he's providing

don't forget us can we find it is to prompt said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no I mean the and the Arabs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not\nRemember how to drive ... and the Democrats and the slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke the child comes it couldn't possibly be good at might mean the end of what ever Rangel or making what the North Korea and it might destroy existing good relations with the child comes\nUp up breaking news China just cut import tariffs on a wide range of\nProducts China but trying comes we'll cut import tariffs on textile products and medals including steel products\nTo aid for like eight point four percent down from eleven and a half percent effective November first according to the tri calm finance ministry yesterday the track I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports\nThat means products from us this year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partner such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X\nY and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one thought it was necessary to do and it's not done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that with Canada and Mexico and lost\nVast amounts of money at a loss for point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs was about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe\nEven longer than maybe forty five minutes I'm\nIn an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions to tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that\nDeal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism or think that it's a big bad meaning and Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we shouldn't feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy that doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs in their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about\nHe is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance and the\nDetails of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the mistake of believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they've been talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with\nAll this kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and\nBut both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nA ... or in the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred

president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster as and skunks that they are\nHe is linking the media to the Democrat Party which\nUh we do with all the time here but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct and Bobby as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find that uh what are you there was Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's fear it sorts button light and it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of the letter one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and fume while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this out rate just allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff if any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[noise]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but\nShe's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns back to the camera women awake at Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and ask them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and ask to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no collaboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter in a phone nor nor\nWas it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless you're German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was the teaching strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript of a conference\nCall that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't\nReproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally habit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democrat front groups

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're going to happen will fund we're going to watch a horse race you have videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and that'll ... starts the tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me it was gonna win players go nuts making their choices tape resumes\nThat about ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds have the final turn ballot checked stops the tape but the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of\nOnes they've made players do what they do that much ... resumes tape to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you want to do what you were making bets you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over\nWho's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter\nFinish doing your job same thing here polls in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media\nWhich is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could have been answered none zilch zero not up and so now\nHere we are on October second CNN Hispanic\n\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the cabinet of lay out now all of a sudden\nHouse races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate but wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't know anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went viral and Dr\nBuys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P in their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run with soundbites of me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nIt's just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused and as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that really find them up that will fire buddy up no the way\nYou can get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to
