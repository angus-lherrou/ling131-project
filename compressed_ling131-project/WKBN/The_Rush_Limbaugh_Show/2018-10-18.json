Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken\nBy the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand eight team to share a Democrat voters who describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money\nCrafts ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all Democrats voters\nWhat a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nWait a minute\nBut those are the level of white working class was told I go to hell and all of a sudden the white\nWomen are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing it anywhere near\nThe rage that they have been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some of the social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nPlacing a much

first\nRepublican history teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written it was just thirdly there's a name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you [noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I mean he was the premier journalists not was not an executive but he practically ran the place\n\nI met him at Mr ... home here in ... you were good buds but Lance Morrow\nWas a a typical turtles which means means left and so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal that\nIs the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump the always concern is that Trump's\nOutrageousness no longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nAnd then if the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing that Democrats have to get their people to the polls\nAnd here comes Liz mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a ripper bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think for a minute here\nThere may be an isolated case of a suburban woman [noise] thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race but this election\nIs really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important\nI just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few\nVotes here it may it may have caused other Republican candidates to Louis maybe hold elections but\nBut but not Trump I just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics deal don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they assume this is it that Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video in it\nThis isn't going to do it [noise]\nFrom the shield dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration\nOnslaught President Trump today\nWarned that he may take military action to stop image\nAnd some crossing the southern border into the U.S may go does not take action to stop the also this is the caravan that's headed our way\nTrump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population\nI'm watching the Democrat Party land because they want to open borders an existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S\n[noise] these people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\n\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking thing that they've got to be using facilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say of the mid term election date\nHelps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so what's\nThe calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be\nThat there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start and by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump weren't there none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow up this like they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the

sixteen on a website called natural news headline read and Carol virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice\nRight right right now the

this would have some effect on those moms with small children for\nA yeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's it's amazing how these things remain isolated we are here in the midst of an invasion of people from various backgrounds from\nVarious countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independently and some days separation apart there's a story\nOf a shockingly unforeseen increase in polio cases in the United states and the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this was happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this\nAnd then a couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's\nA relationship here but you're you're absolutely right there cannot
