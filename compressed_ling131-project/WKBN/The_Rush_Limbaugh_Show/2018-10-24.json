want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are\nThirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things\nIs average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear\nPolitics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today he said that if there was a blue\nWave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top\nUp here\nAnd Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and\nAnalyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning\nThe Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five of them sort of two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd

[noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on everybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in the Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly isn't\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their life in America is not say that this is just to pet it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a

talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting\nThese bombs in the mail [noise] you know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information out there for the masses to obtain you know there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain deep but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do\nSomething that's whoa it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that\nWay it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what does it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat\nIn cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not\nWorking out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nBut the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the pollsters tell them there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to some men to it like that Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the
