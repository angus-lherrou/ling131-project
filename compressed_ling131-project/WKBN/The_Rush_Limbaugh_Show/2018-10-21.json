uh in our favor when I say are I mean those of us who want to see some checks and balances put in place\nI don't think everything the president does is wrong but I think that for some of his actions

have a Republican Senate but there is a chance that the house could turn blue and I would welcome that and by the way we'll have election coverage to uh till eleven o'clock will have alive segment right here on news radio five Seventy WKBD and stick around for that on election night\nAnd uh well let's see you know just to be fair\nI'm Sorry a there is a caller online if somebody else calling which I'll never understand the show every week we're done at one o'clock and if you're in a lot of these people listen to this thing regularly when we come back that last break doesn't last that long to see why\nI didn't start a call but I Will say hey Jake thanks for making me sound so good as usual\nAnd I will say to the rest of you have a good week\nRight right we have to remind ourselves as constantly you know those of us who write about these things for a living that most people out in America or not is obsessed with that if we are\nSo what what other changes I guess from the the last time survey versus the this time survey\nOne thing that hasn't really changed and and it's an accelerating over the last several decades is that\nA lot of these other identities that you know are not political in nature your\nReligion whether you are religious or non religious heal race they have come into alignment with political identity to a degree that really was not the case you know twenty thirty forty years ago so for instance you know if I told you I'm\nIn uh Nineteen nineties that\nAh I'm I Am a non religious white woman that wouldn't really tell you a whole lot about my politics but now it is increasingly the case in non religious people are much more likely to be Democrats religious people I'm much more likely to be Republicans\nA you know we're seeing a much clearer sort of alignment along racial lines where the Republican Party is much more heavily represented among whites and non whites are much more heavily leaning toward the Democratic party\nSo we see the pillow race along with religion we're increasingly starting to get an education to and that you know more educated voters are now starting to lean toward the Democratic party more\nSo you know that sort of suggest that you know even if you say that your political identity is not that important to you all of these other kinds of identity that are important team increasingly kind of tell us about your politics\nWell respected Emily badger writer for upshot at the New York times and she's written a piece and settled Americans either politics do to find them but it's complicated you said you up people even change their policy preferences depending on which identities they're thinking about what does that mean\nWell so you had lots of different identity is at any given them you know you have a radio show you are a man\nA you know you know a friend that particular part of the country is late with your home town and whichever one of those is important to you may sort of changed by the moment depending on what you're doing or what you're thinking about so political scientists have found that you know people policy preferences can change if you get them to think about certain identity is over other\nIdentities so for example a\nYou know Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support things like sentencing reform\nA or you know to to say that they want to spend money on social services and that's more important and then worrying about the the federal deficit\nBut political scientists have done experiments where they've shown that if you get Democrats to sort of think about the fact that their parents first and foremost you actually see their\nViews shifted to become a little bit more conservative on those kinds of questions so that suggests that you know identity is a very kind of fluid thing that shift depending on you know the context that you're in what you're thinking about but\nAh that that your policy preferences night shift as well I think it's a little bit surprising to us because most of us tend to think that our policy preferences are these very sort of well thought out logical conclusion that we reach\nEmily badger she writes were up

the daily dive weekend edition I'm Oscar ... and we're running down some of the top stories of the week don't forget to check out the daily died Monday through friday for more news without the noise [laughter] I think one of\nThe stories it's captured everybody's attention this week is that of the lottery the mega millions jackpot is the largest that it's ever been Powerball is going to have a big drawing over the weekend also\nI think between the both of them they're going to be given away one point three to one point four billion dollars in lottery Miranda if you won the lottery who would be the first person you'd call\nAnd I think I called my friend Meghan McCain because her family has been insanely mouthy forever [laughter] and so she's the only person I Know who would not try to get money out and yeah and she would know that people to call the primates that leftover generation\nThat's funny that I thought you were to say something like hey I'm as rich as you guys but [laughter]\nI I mean I might say that the experts say that the first person you shouldn't be calling is actually a lawyer because there's a lot of stuff\nThat you have to deal with when you win the lottery a lot of times in states your name has to be publicly announced you can't get away I think there is only six states where you can't be named where you can remain anonymous oh it's crazy but just you know good luck to everybody out there playing\nFor the mega millions your chances of winning or one in three hundred and two point six million or ... for winning the Powerball it's one in two hundred and Ninety two million so and then the chances of winning both let's say you played everything\nOne in eighty eight quandary really and then I ... followed by Fifteen zeroes so and I miss the odds are crazy we spoke to Rodrigo ... he's a reporter for the record in New Jersey and we talked to him about why you should be calling a lawyer first and how they can help you out\nKeep your mouth shut and call a lawyer towards winning a big I spoke to a uh Jason Carlin he's an attorney based in union New York he's actually the self proclaimed lottery lawyer he's represented more than thirty lottery winners ... eleventh\nI saw him at his name mentioned in a bunch of articles yeah he is the guy\nI guess you'd say the expert on this type of stuff and he said that's pretty much the first thing he told me before you speak to anybody call a lawyer particularly one that has experience in representing lottery winners and basically protecting them from a lot of the pitfalls of when it so much money and such a short time\nRight 'cause people don't know what to do with all that money at first and the jackpot for the mega millions is nine hundred and Seventy million dollars if you take the cash option it's five hundred and forty eight million dollars is\nStill a ton of money one of the main pitfalls is a lot of states require you to be publicly announced it's like a matter of public record so you can't get away with being anonymous\nIn New Jersey I actually did another article trying to answer that question because a few months back the jak off of the mega millions was also\nPretty large so people the the question that I Will get most frequently is can I claim my jackpot anonymously if I win\nSo I figured it out and unfortunately the answer is no you you really can't in New Jersey it's a matter of public record in other words if the average citizen is allowed to end encouraged us to file what's called the public record a quest and do that you can obtain the name of any lottery winner\nBe a director actually of the state lottery said you know this is a very public game so we want people's names out there you know this is\nWe want people to know who's getting the money that they've spent on the statewide damn this lottery and you know a lot of people have also offered up well can I start a allow the or an entity to claim the pride Ryan James carry his his name director of the lottery he said yeah that's fine you can do that of course\nAnd they'll pay the jackpot to whatever entity you set up for that but your name will still be public record\nI I guess may maybe the only thing in that is that you could ... your name coming out because the the trustworthy L. L. C. might get first building\nOr there is only six states where you can remain anonymous Delaware Kansas Marilyn North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina [laughter] you know pretty much anywhere\nYou're names and to get out there I I Know people have said you should get off the Internet immediately before you announce you know close your social media down if you have a landline making unlisted before skip town if you can write when they're got an ounce it's so that you're not there and you know you work in the media\nWell come back to the daily died weekend edition here's the rest of our conversation with ... and I started off by asking him how the U.S is going to fare with beer prices\n[laughter] and who are the countries that are going to be affected by this the most I Know Ireland I guess I could see triple a prices of beer but we're all the other countries and where does the U.S fairness\nThe northern Europe is gets the biggest hit because they all have to report that most barley to make the beer and\nThe U.S consumption drops and the price goes up but not as much as other places because barley production starts moving north into Canada further so we don't lose as much supply a burly is imported and exported widely and that was the corporate as a model but you know it really helps in terms of price to half the stuff here by\nWhat's been the reaction from other groups or you know beer trade groups I Know the brewers association was one of them that said hey you know but this is an academic exercise don't believe all the hype nothing to lose sleep over and they also say you know that farmers would be adapting as things that happened you know the shift\nBar the growing to other parts where they can still get good yields but so what's been the reaction out of other people outside of the study\nSummarized the beer industry is reaction pretty nicely yeah they said were on top of this thing there was a drought and the Pacific northwest last year that affected Brawley production and so we're all aware of this and worrying about it and that's a nice thought some of the people who look at sort of large\nScale farming say that you know these are changes are going to be happening on continent wide scale and it is going to affect crops when you have drought and heat waves we\nCan engineer for things like drought resistance\nThat actually might change the nutrient profile with a barley which might change the taste of the beer\nOr you know it's what's in it and you can editor for drought resistance but he resistance is a tough one and he is the thing that's going on what time of climate change and that might change these very basic chemical reactions that are going on in our early that my\nEarly early and so that's why you have to move it or or harm it than you know you run\nOut of north after a while and it becomes more expensive to do that sort of thing you're competing with other crops so the people who study these things on ... agricultural economics basis or not as sanguine as the industry on the other hand you know people like beer and the industry is pretty innovative one in some way so you know maybe they will get on top of it it just shows is not cheaper though than like not having to worry about it\nYeah I think it's just pretty funny how quickly this story went viral you know obviously climate change a lot of people are always attuned to that but you throw in beer at one of the authors of the study even said not sure what to make of the fact that in one day our paper on climate and beer has garnered considerably more attention than\nAny of their previous work on energy transitions air pollution death anything other than that you know it's like this you know you're messing with my beer and you know everybody's interested in it right away Denver got a science reporter for buzzfeed news thank you very much for joining us thank you [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll this month of October I've been putting in little stories and the podcast is trying to get everybody to get on the same level of Halloween that I Love to get every year the one that caught my attention this past week\nWas that every child vampire burial that was found in Italy in some type of baby cemetery\nThere was this eerie discovery that they found it was the skeleton of a ten year old that had a rock lodged in his mouth they bury this child is way because they were afraid who's going to come back to life and continue to spread malaria I spoke to my producer Miranda and we talked about this vampire burial site in Italy\nResearchers from the University of Arizona and also a university to Stanford\nWent on this dig in Italy and they found this\nChild cemetery and so inside of a miniature him in what used to be a gigantic\nRoman villa they said it was about the size of a shopping mall if you can think about like that they found a body of the ten year old child who died more than Fifteen hundred years ago the skeleton was lying on its side with its mouth open and stuffed inside a limestone rock\nAbout the size of a big egg and like you said they believed that child\nDied of malaria\nSixty miles north of round and they said that the way that they buried this kid let's say that the kid who was already already dead\nThey opened the mouse for ... to the rock inside and then failed that extra spots with cement so that they can be sure that the rock wouldn't come out right and they were able to determine how old the kid was by looking at the teeth depression\nAnd that's how they know that the rock was put in after he was dead because of those same impressions right locally or they're calling it the vampire of little nano it's in this like you said is in this area which was like the center of witchcraft and the Roman empire at that time in Italy they said that this burial site has also been called London properly they bend beanie\nWhich is a cemetery of babies and they found all sorts of different stuff in this very will say you said it was like a huge villa\nAnd they found remnants of a ... in these trenches they're covered trenches\nThere was remains of infants toddlers aborted fetuses that had been buried alongside raven talents toad bones ROMs called dreams these things were filled with ash and sacrificial puppies\nYeah archaeologist call these deviant burials which is the ancient way of burying people who were they feared would have supernatural abilities like coming back from the dead or that the where people and like I don't know how this would apply to children but that had violated society's rules hence the name the vampire ...\nAnd a lot of these archaeologists and researchers saying it's stuff that they just didn't understand these illnesses like malaria at the time they probably didn't have a handle on it they didn't know what it was or why it was popping up\nAnd things that they feared they thought might come back from the dead that thought they were vampires that's why they took these extra steps to bury them this way so that they couldn't come back and continue to spread diseases\nAnd they would do all kinds of things like that were rituals rituals you didn't say they would dump honey suck all all over the place and these were just to kind of try to make it as your as possible so that these spirits with just pass\nAlong and not come back we don't know the gender of this ten year old the skeleton that was there but they said that near this one was a three year old girl the the remains of a three year old girl they found\nThat said there her hands and feet had been way down with stones which was another form of vampire burial to keep the evil away so that she couldn't get up they were able to dig in into the bones and the remains and they also found that she had died of malaria\nAnd they're saying that the reason why there are so many children's bodies that they had done extensive research on to find out yeah they all died for malaria is because it's Roman Empire section was considered to be a cesspool of diseases and it spread it through\nContaminated food and water and it was pretty swampy so there are a ton of mosquitoes and that's why there was so much malaria up until they pretty much figured it out in the Eighteen hundreds\nThis is not the only sight of these quote unquote vampire burials yeah in northern Italy there was a woman who's buried with a brick and her mouth\nAlmost the same thing like the ... you know a shape rock but this was a British huge too you know she was dubbed the vampire of Venice and England there was another guy who had his tongue taken out and replaced with a stone\nSo it just seemed like that was one of the populace methods are popular rituals\nTo keep them from being able to come back from the day but that\nGuy in England is fascinating because clearly in the year two hundred these people are talking to each other so somewhere these people in England new to do this exact same type of burial and the people in northern Italy or doing at the same time\nYeah it's interesting just what people will do when you fear or something you don't know how to control or react to it you go through these extra steps these rituals and label them which isn't vampires and things like that so\nIt's just pretty creepy that they would do that to a small child but when you're scared of something you're going to do those extra steps to protect yourself making random thank you ask her [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nAll right that's it for us this weekend he sure to check out the daily diving every Monday through friday [noise]\nJoined us on social media nearly died pot on Twitter daily podcast on base [noise]\nLeave us a comment give us a rating and tell us the stories that you're interested [noise]\nAll of the daily dive and I heard radio subscribe wherever you get your pocket [noise]\nThe daily died was produced by random er into an engineer by Tony soaring Tina I'm Oscar mares in Los Angeles and this was your daily dive weekend [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Brian Clark [noise]\nBut it's it's a British network and the title it's a six episode one hour per episode many series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than the\nFuror trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIts fight out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the ... got suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago\nWhen I first began to encounter the media\nAs a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full\nDose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs ladder if you go back to\nThe early days of sixty minutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen honest this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides\nHis journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual stuff there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a ... I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's quite it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much\nUh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertainer to buy it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper or the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the pizza file story while the other paper puts it on the cover having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us Peter found just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have\nThe guts to run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about the me too movement here ever put the same thing I was so the name of it is ...\nI have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] it's it's it's bad hit\nEverybody everybody is a rapid rate including the people\nThe papers the reporters I I have to admit I was so [noise]\nAnyway here's Donald Brazil now I Would I did not lose my place she's with Bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed and remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who\nIs saying that the Kavanaugh hearings backfired on the Democrats because it alienated man\nAnd now she's warning the Democrats to stop to hide their agenda of identity politics until they get into power she's telling you guys have got to put the masks back on your Democrats have got to read camouflage yourself she's warning the Democrats to hide the identity politics agenda\nOf course we should fight Mr ... racism whether or not it's politically expedient these are important but the country faces lots of important moral questions Democrats can't attribute without first getting into power she's saying these never shot up stop\nYour your everything's back firing until you Democrats shut\n[noise]\nPeople hang onto their every word\nEven though\nThey are the most interesting morning show\n\nMy friends\nThis is Donald from your voice in the valley Dan rivers on five Seventy WKBD ...

find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that the story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump\nThat her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a

this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have\nI have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it to go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense\nThat orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama you go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats\nNationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nAre you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe\nOut the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power\nIn terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nObama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party no\nBeing toward unification
