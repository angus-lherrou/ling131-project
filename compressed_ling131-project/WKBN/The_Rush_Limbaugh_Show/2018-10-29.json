twenty nine charges including murder and hate crimes rabbi Jeffrey Myers was leading a service of the tree of life synagogue when the attack happened and he tells ABC News when\n\nAnd not what I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first instinct they have is to try to find a way\nLink who ever committed the bat\nIndeed do the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that's supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I wore dealt with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever tried to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory just\nSay that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take a to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets that\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill\nFor ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of the political party or it's the fault of eight presidents and and so predictable because they hate\nThe president will do and then they can to get rid of him they've spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\n\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico [noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything [noise]\nAnd you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it it is my your mental come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people you think are fed up with this by now\nYou think this is going to affect the mid term lay Democrats in Libya I gotta I got a clue for you [noise]\nNeither of these events that you are hyping are gonna ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going you pretend the rats at least two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up and just somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but that doesn't ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up with being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support those you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for

does this joint base business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them on the court and joint base\nWhere

target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that and all the other things [noise] an anti\nSemitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that ought to tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political

thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nOff the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of what what will people asking what what what happened to Max Boot

precisely because he is cut from\nThe different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable in one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes

start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not gonna last his campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting\nAnd this guy is not going to last there's this craziness\nTrump kept slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a land back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and

called my final summation that happened on friday about why\nWe're suspicious of the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing

going to stop I don't need to be told or reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of Trump\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just folks beside themselves that everything they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe I'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government have gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense fickle thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be ass\nEvery day for two years New
