evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial man or far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmatively to the question now how the hell can that\nBe 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for

go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nHello that rush a good to talk with you [noise]\nUm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person they contacted Amish Kaiser on and trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's\nThe same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how a ... there was coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah and that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring we wouldn't Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been\nReported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times associate oppressed people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and they test them I should get in she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yes as a ... absolutely that when they wrote a letter when when when balls the Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... a Delaware with my client yet\nSo here's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not as the Democrats oddly enough we're not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out\n...\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people are saying they're going to vote changes it suddenly it goes down and a quarter and then because all of this is about to come out\nNext not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead Lynn Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference that end Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls before the witnesses being pressure to change your test them on the Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes of the baby CBS NBC began to report on this day but wouldn't change one Democrat Senate about\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\nWell the question is why wouldn't Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy would it make wherever it took a um [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI report the Republicans I think that Democrats can see it if the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report\nThey discovered that my\nMy combined knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth they are not mentioned what we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning it\nOK okay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou're sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the Boise foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they have not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor the exact reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in

men in mentioned does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he has um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen the turtle is adamant it\nThis week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still\nGrassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might have found that the Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations us shortly one producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial a doctor Ford's allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegations she passed a lighter texture and we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have\nClaimed some reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third\nTime in writing to turn over to therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them they are how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony\nOr coaching her whatever I mean he's loaded for bear this just the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones and been to the Senate or are they\nThe media people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab one of the aisle soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judges Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this\nFit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email last night from Salinas Ito\nWho has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them to what never\nNumbers are anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance and by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are laughed at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the camping on hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way\nSadly that\nAfter a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the capital circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nYou know with our in like an update\nAnd nationally that's what this election is\nYour you like it had gotten we're going to mean Leslie listening five Seventy W Cheney [noise]\n\nVoted by the women's possible margin fifty one two forty nine to advance Brett Kavanaugh Supreme

despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself in men dasa they and and a number of other things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed court stays up for for a deadlock what the what the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking court\nThat could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll to supposedly be in unison with\nMe too movement [noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks

up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it would that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching on the dental camp do you\nSee the pain the expression on the face\nOf Murkowski and the ex Russian of in hand\n\nSeriousness and you better be

[noise]\n[noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been

that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh\nIn the state of

to punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kevin did anything to anybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that\nAnd then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperament temperament and they were going to deny because he committed perjury and I'm not going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in\nCollege but Corker made it plain that he doesn't think\nKevin all should be held accountable for things he has
