J. D.

B. I. special agent her best friend for a wife\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement to ABC I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed a credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this\nOr through this with out\nAny any challenging them Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech patterns I look\nI'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art that I may have gotten it out there that time we'll see\nAre a specialty of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\nMerit any personal ... mind about fat half an hour that's that's how I found and Eric ... even ...\nI talk about an attack on the ground and right now and I found out ... ...\n... even now I'm back on that kind of a ... foot down without a ... [noise]\nBad you can read like how many [noise] sad [noise] Atlanta I'm In town about bumped up last night\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence that\nFits vulnerability ... is it fringe ill at the almost in a way or maybe even some buddy nervous and traumatized\nAnd scared and that is exactly the a personality that I think she wanted the FX and she succeeded with it and it's because\nOf that but I think I don't no matter what his learned about her and how much she has\nLived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had nobody else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there are noticing things\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel liberal asked her about subject a and her answer it and read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph why she asked him this\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about Canada why aren't you asking her details to confirm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFour and a has a best friend in the FBI who read ... resigned retired in two thousand sixteen\nA wonder how many people working on the Trump case of the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean no you know what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as this letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she charged about six hundred bucks on\nA\nFord was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel metro have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph\nTest never remember when the question was asked I Do think what the hell was this now Senator Grassley\nHas been busy refuting claims made by ... and others Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job\nAs is his staff here at Grassley\nSent a letter to foreigners attorneys telling them about the ex boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test\nAnd has again we ask\nFor the therapists notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see even notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took and Ford's lawyer's have returned that reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are\nMonica McLean left the FBI and the D. O. J. after twenty four years of employment there as soon as Trump\nWon the election two thousand and sixteen\nThey only think Ford has turned over from the polygraph his two questions remember when that came up the polygraph exams I asked her to a question as to question what polygraph just wouldn't lie detector test only asked two questions that's all the committee has been given\nFranklin that deeply sad at an apartment complex in Columbia now because we've been hammered timber point about men will be under a boy and later today is the city and styles of water line and creed street or starting at eight thirty this morning is expected to take about ... hours the water will be temporarily shut off until work is complete\nLawmakers from both sides of the island condemning president taps or marks about Brett Kavanaugh's accuser\nAnd Pope Francis is leaving confidence among Catholics in the U.S made the clergy sex scandals and the poll by the Pew Research center finds only thirty one percent of us like say the pope's handling of the scandals is good or excellent down from forty five percent it started this year\nComing to our several ab like TNC account ...

there's a\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left has infiltrated everything ... obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year in ... in the story wrong\nThey not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait till closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhy cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim he's mocking boldly forty wasn't mocking or\nWhat I understand Republican senators saying what Thursday all my friends when\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we know when he said that why he sent it\nTo everybody has to\nDo this is a investigated put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's desert even if it's warranted last week it could not read up on Christie involved before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so ... of course I find compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so critical she never was but now she's not so credible and Trump just come out Trump did is out of her story we should've happened during the hearing last Thursday but the ...\nAmericans we're not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing and if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the prompt for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax\nStory on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia a tendon for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zeroed not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump but he got rich from his dad\nActually or whatever something somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\n[noise] a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi and said don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what you gotta do when you got to go to ... what'd you gotta come up against what you're gonna come to you going to come up with the women like New Hampshire not great but it's not a bill\nClinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they don't want them to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either\nRape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that\nProtester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protester hold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\n... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight and I would make sure women or heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protest there's no there is evidence look at the standard how many people are in jail\nFor ... so\nWhat this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you\nCan't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media [noise]\nYou know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't

gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't say Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I found her compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will read something or say something it'll make you look like he's about like ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at the moon to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes that initial statement on something if he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was the one the horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just said we probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell rush or ... women are nor do we do\nYeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this\nAbout Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did was\nSay what everybody is following this knows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people that's one of the many reasons why she's needed\nIt's Hannah

James them to the gym and guarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics or I'm convinced that a significant chunk of grass roots political activist or not really arguing about\nPolitics at all these people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and print things them onto the world of politics bingo I've been searching for bad description for years I have no\nProblem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kind of psychological disorder they've turned into politics\nFor a solution or the river which is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group ... or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the this this um well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it is okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement to look at black lives matter take any left wing group that you want it's\nEat up of people who for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on a girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nI pick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a scammed in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's\nThe same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints Democrat parties\nHappy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage and the angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had Woolsey forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocked she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine ...\nAnd here it is that there's this they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of protection from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they vote or do you think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately somebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old I ever among glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again\nA right to have your back\nYou great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while you're like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nKind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies\nCampus the the outright hatred for men\nBut it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nYou have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist\nBut it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine\nIf not better right by the way here's this ... you're also right up it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't\nIt the me too movement supposedly includes women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think every major young you're growing up I think you're going

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that the cabinet with not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place\nNow saying well you know there's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats\nBegan smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent to hike camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nOther words these three Heitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way\nFor Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford\nI Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs noted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford\nHerself presented\nThe power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the sordid event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float\nShe's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text chart there is some\nAh some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapists notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties in her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened\nIn the mid eighties\nAnd heard a letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\n\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high schools summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness who's memories change at her convenience\n\nProblem for Dr Ford is not that\nIs it remember everything if the everything she remembers changes at her convenience first Ford's testimony the assaults occurred in the summer of eighty two when she would just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President alert or your phones and ... yeah I forgot to warn people about does it to
