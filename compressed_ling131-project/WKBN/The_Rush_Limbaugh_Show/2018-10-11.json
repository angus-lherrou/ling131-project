{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "So I think there's a lot of approaches people can can think about it and we can talk to the legislature about I've set up my approach which is different from that\nI had said that on infrastructure we should have a bonded finance package which should put it to the voters this has happened four times in the last Thirty years\nBoaters about higher willing to approve infrastructure spending because they know they're getting something important for that money and the long term strengthening the state and in the short run good jobs around Ohio that's what I said we should be the reason we should get that\nRight now interest rates are low it's a smart thing for the state to do and eventually you know we we've been promised infrastructure money the federal government that has materialized no ministry shouldn't get the tax bill and spend the tree that an app on that they don't have money for infrastructure right now but eventually they will step up and provide money\nThey will probably requirements state and local match so\nHaving our package in place will give us the ability to draw down most federal funds we we end up being a donor state than sending sending money back to the federal government more more to them that we get from them and we need to make sure that went infrastructure that comes around we get our fair share\nMore you know rich your answer is a little more complicated than my question which I'm thinking in simplistic terms but to be very specific is that a good idea what we're talking about or is that too simplistic to say\n... counties let's not let's not taken divide all the deck tax gases or the gas tax let's do it by the size that doesn't that make some sense to you\nBut here's what I said for example the oil and gas industry and eastern Ohio is booming right now but it also creates a lot of burden for the local communities in terms of a burden on the roads and the like I said we need to keep a more that revenue in eastern Ohio and that makes sense to me I think it's along the lines of what you're just saying\nWhen kids should read the more money to the places that need it the most uh and that's that's a that's a good principle for us to think about how we can implement that I agree with you on that\n... the final thing that I have this rich did you get caught up in this issue one here and that you would not rather have been supporting it but you you just had to support it because someone brought it for the pure and a girl in the wrong side of that\n... how do you feel about issue one and for most ... out here basically it would have less people in prison more people going to drug courts it's a constitutional amendment that's just the basics you know it better than I Do\nWhat is your hard depart somebody's shoe one\nSo my heart of hearts here is that I Want us to see change from the failed status quo by the wind on the opioid crisis what we know is in Ohio the jets have been rising every year to record levels three thousand three years ago four thousand two years ago forty nine hundred last year whatever we're doing now is not\nWorking we need change now this is people are frustrated that they put this on the ballot 'cause the legislature hasn't done anything meaningful nor his might wind to address this problem or and seven hundred thousand island science to put it on the ballot I'd like to see change issue one is a possible change\nLegislative packages that others are putting the other like the Athens County prosecutor for the Franklin County prosecutor\nFor all we need to do something different and on fat and salt in particular Mike DeWine has been\nYou know we probably should hear\nSeventy eight year when I was attorney general thousand four hundred and thirty one last year we become a drug dealers playground that my wife was asleep at the switch\nDuring Richard and get that were you called me again\nHappy to\nOur will set something up again and I wanted to ask you a couple of more things but uh let's see if we can set something up for next week and we'll talk you know is that\nSounds good All right thank\nThank you rich Cordray he's running for governor here in Ohio and uh some types of cells work and sometimes they don't today was one of those days worth what didn't I really wanted to get to this question here and my question was going to be\nWho is really supporting the wine and who is supporting Cordray when it comes to law enforcement\n'cause you you you folks you got to be confused as I Am\nThe wine as a commercial bell where he's rolling out he's got all these guys and\nA half so they're they look like they're supporting Mike DeWine and then rich Cordray says well the ... and the other top law enforcement agencies in Ohio are supporting me so I wanted to get to that but I guess we'll have to wait what book him again next week or get the wine on the bus the snow as much as we can\nAs we go forward to another selection I Want to hear from everybody right\nAbsolutely but I think I just got a very good answer on the gas tax it's a really good but that's that seems to be something that pattern any support\nTo wrap it up in a minute\n\nAh it really is is such an honor to you know to have a number one song period is is amazing but British sit there for that long\nOr in into his even the that that you know Taylor did in two thousand or something like that yeah [noise]\nIs is truly just incredible\nIt's hard to even think about without just kind of getting a little bow of doing that but um it's a it's really special\nKeep listening to Iranian foreign my comment is\nYour favorite out\nYour old Fishell storm center station five Seventy doubled you Katie and\nWhat happened the first day of the Trump presidency he gave you a job I rejected it listen it's only\nSupply weekdays at noon five Seventy WKBD in Youngstown [noise]\nFrom Seventeen twenty seven according cigar box partly cloudy sixty eight we've had our high runner way down right now it's sixty six bowling temperatures tonight to a lower thirty eight sixty six [noise] well you know we all talk about deadlines right I've got another killing story before I depart here today Jason and your bet they were in liberty they called Kelly Warren\nUrgent situation Jason get a job transfer forty five days to get to their new place in Texas moving can be stressful enough but when you're under a deadline it's even worse they needed a quick sale in the most money possible to purchase a new home in Texas before we started to work\nThey heard about Kelly's guarantee you talk about this all the time you know they knew her and they would have at least one offer on the table they hired Kelly warrant and\nYou know what the guarantee wasn't even need it you could do it seven one seven twenty six eighty\nSeven ... seven twenty six eighty nine until tomorrow [noise] [noise]\n... salutes our first responders and the men and women in service to our nation hello\nI'm a like\nOil company providing quality fuel ... for more than Ninety eight years lighting oil young stone\n\nTime is high noon\n[noise]\nAnd they're the ones that run around claiming that ever they must be attached to climate change when it is a weather event anyway I said eventually don't don't get so upset by this this is nothing I mean this is this is I'm actually flattered nobody mentioned in the piece here\nBut he\nCertainly was mad because he doesn't know what to do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth [noise] [noise] and you don't you defeat it\nYou don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find with all the chart and hurricanes since Nineteen hundred you can find you know significant trend in even the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no\nEvidence\nThat climate change manmade even exists and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the dry buys are offered to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to ... and ... why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic autocratic tyrannical government control over everything once you are the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong\nThen you can be controlled to make sure that you start doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis but in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunderstorms he doesn't know cloud tops ... temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Want to assure you that these kinds of things no longer [noise]\nBother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's\nTo edit feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing to which other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question where Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny ah Eric Holder the attorney general for\n... same all involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side than these so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder was saying what he said\nYou know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high end holder said screw in that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we kept them\n\nSo people so my God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying that we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama met him when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated that house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they most won the Senate\nThey have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall folks they can scratch their bags with it they just can't aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's going to tie Trump and Russia and it's going to prove\nThe trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at Kanye West\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing\nThat's what

smartest man in pop\nMusic hip hop class act the firing the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way so what would I be Thirteen\nYears ago Kanye West was the future Kanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy the way Trump is funny that Trump Trump pose a why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying them whether you can Trump said you know what you have a point but there were people that have been lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I

Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nOf Saudi Arabia his father is the king king sol ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh started the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the ... issue these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the shows in San ...\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning you will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the song of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making\nFriends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know always wine and dine the Google guy he's wind and dined Facebook guys and a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nKinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive to go places on their own without mail is ...\nBut this made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night and it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton\nHotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding\nA certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do the corruption and connections and soon as he made a lot of enemies well\nJamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin

reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin among despite their reforms in Saudi Arabia\nYou still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you

that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he

for them because of the great improvements that'll happen in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise]\nRight here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well\nI'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want room ... eight

kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise] I don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones men in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe\nThat the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that's a whole lot here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed\nEverything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right one were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough to make us not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans of conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we

more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust and members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the

... this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\nSo ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to and I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number Seventeen sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends today is talking to Steve do see\nA doozy said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we had it on a great control I don't think really\nBig was very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people are lined up they expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do when it dead and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder\nFormer attorney\nGeneral said they go low we kick them and the whole room Mr\nPresident started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe and for him to make a very dangerous they put holder was held in contempt by Congress older when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to being told you like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever we send them to Republicans ... away or not even acknowledge or or they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd ... rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder renting it but but but much oh totally I totally uncalled for and we we were only a unilateral condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of see song it's been a roller coaster ring and Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something books there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nFederal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or at four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm paying\nThat's at irate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy is a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump for him to know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know much at Tommy leftists as they are many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it they said there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election is why things down so they react\nTo it and and there's

Trump stir and the hill the beast and\nChris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not going to sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes we've counted the votes\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for the Trump\nKnowledge what you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American ... that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up and said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight\nHillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we remember\nI didn't believe in saying that this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his mind a little bit with Clinton on October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBen Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nThan roads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results so\nThis is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and cause delays or rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happened no matter what the outcome was they're going to use your Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the all the garbage she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day
