anti Trump or did you come out [noise]\nPro pro democratic ... ... oh yeah it was Tennessee she came out against Blackburn right uh what in the media say the media said record turnout record voter registration after Taylor Swift\nHow many people bought that that is such ... there is no way to measure that that's wishful thinking but the reason I bring this up and I don't know Taylor Swift from a pilot call\nI don't know that every year could put a bag of nowhere in a bag out there and I wouldn't know the difference in ...\nNow a story is Taylor Swift lead American music awards hit all time low ratings well how the hell can it be if she is generating massive record voter registration and then the host the television show an all time low record ratings\nDon't listen I don't have one the other but Taylor Swift I don't I'm not comparing hurt your bag of a newer I'm saying that's how it significant but I'm the drive by trying to take these things they're so desperate for good news they're desperate\nFor you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence over the fact they're going to be running the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this was in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nSounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this\nGuy was a legislative aide to who who do you think this guy worked for the lord mention a former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you quail you're no Jack Kennedy that lord Benson right okay [noise]\nWell whether he did or not he's still in writes pieces for the for they hold uptown Butowsky code red alert to Democrats\nWhat are the Democrats were smoking I bought the Democrats are going to win everything like the hill got kind of had a story yesterday I mean it looked like two hundred nine seats are going to convert to the Democratic party\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama and one of the most popular respected in public figures in America shouldn't spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates\nFor the house and Senate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms\nAre the most popular in respect to Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance or the Democrats and the mid terms with the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up I thought you're pretty much had the house already done\nAlthough she's already talking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on then Trump or reversed myself\nNow there is a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same\nAs a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible\nThat Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible Democrats gain only Wednesday seats falling short of winning control\nThat would leave the Republicans nominate with a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate\nDoes even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority that\nButowsky says\nIt's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and try I'm ... Trump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand along side Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved but unstoppable dominance\nThe speed to find out what the force of the wind is\nSo a hundred and fifty miles an hour [laughter] [noise] it's devastating now where\nDid those wins happen are those surface Windsor and those flight level wins\nAnd this is what you have to have a hurricane hunter data to what to know but they are reported as wins on the surface hundred and fifty mile an hour winds at the surface I mean there's there's\nVery little it's going to survive that so we will ah will see I'm exactly what at landfall the true when force winds speed happens to be and find out how close to the forecast a it was you know you're going\nBack here to the bowling team captain ... piece rent Butowsky then you'd notice who he said that if the Republicans hold on if the Republicans hold on to the house and hold on to the Senate did you hear him very frightfully\nPoint out how that would happen\nIt wouldn't happen\nBecause moderate Republicans would be losing and they wouldn't be replaced by conservative Republicans other words if the Republicans hold the Republicans who will win in these districts where Republicans are retiring his theory is we\nCan get even more conservatism we can get even more conservative house in a more concerned is that he's putting the moderate\nRepublicans at greatest risk for losing in his theory in his in his code red alert warning Democrats the Republicans could win it so he's saying that moderate Republicans are at greater risk\nOf losing their seats in the house now how is that possible given\nEverything else we're told by the Democrat Party and the drive by media they tell us\nLoves the moderates America loves the centrists America doesn't want any part of extremists America wants no part whatsoever radicals and yet there is the entire Democratic Party which is nothing but radical now\n\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\n\nThey are very alarmed\nIn fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling\nData there is an NPR poll\nOut there there was a Fox News for a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in\nPolling data that they have a renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote\nThis is not what we're supposed to happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping into white conservative suburban\nWomen and do we need them or not and we don't\nThey say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand six in as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\nI mean they had Trump's chances at three percent seven percent ten percent\nBut nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to win all the press that Trump and quarters that's what they want you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nSaid yesterday that the trying times are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms this is the Trump administration's latest warning that the check comes or attempting to sway American opinion I have with the elections\nWho ... who wants a whim [noise]\nTry comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to come through not our friends that China calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nThe ... I don't want any part of Trump Donald Trump this this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this is done\nThis has put China back on its heels like nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access to Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada\nYou've got to go through us you've got to make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the child comes never thought this was going to happen\n\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats put up I just find it fascinating international bunch of communists are trying to affect our elections so that they're friendly Democratic Party in America wins\nThat somebody has to have much to say Russia's probably by being met for Dan Rather Monday through friday and age [noise]\nWhen you put a safe in your home what would you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand to say if you should trust to put in your home and that's rhino saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America would amaze you it takes skill sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nHow did you get your own rhino metal safe well check out their extensive dealer network online at rhino safe dot com veteran own didn't veteran operated for over Twenty years that's our H.

Ford for her allegations what message does that send to women\nAnd remember women went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did I'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me white women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the\nWhite vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\n\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton's stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept\nFor a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you couldn't understand why in the Democratic party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting them white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early\nTwenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plans their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\n\nAnd that wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm for up seeing that it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on and on for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at the judicial system has been viewed by you\nAs he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats\nAs your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most certainly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never\nBeen capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe ass not by you in fact ...\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity on for listening to one another working on our differences but\nIs not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here\nYou go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies\nThat happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\n\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nBefore we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you get the podcast everyday how have your range to receive it\nWell I
