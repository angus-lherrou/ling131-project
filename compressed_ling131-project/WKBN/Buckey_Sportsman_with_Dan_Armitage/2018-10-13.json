{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "From day one or maybe you know you're Twenty one let's call it always loved the stuff but as far as uh the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things\nOver the years I think I could look back to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that found a twist off but you don't have an opener\nUm but somebody always had a bit later on and I got taught a kind of the party trick or being able to to wedge a bottle of beer open with a lighter um\nAnd then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like it was silly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make this a book [laughter]\nThe the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book as a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against the tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nAfter grip correctly or it's all laid out\nThere um with illustration diagrams a and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a for 'em so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that one's actually um something of a ... to where you tell people buy buy chicken open this\nPiece of paper that way and ah and then you fold it six or seven times until you have a thin very stiff about hunk of paper um and use the same principles and then somebody as you a beer\nOr speaking with Ben Robbins and he's got a new book called ... tips tricks and projects he's also editor in chief of the observer what about the some of these projects which put together on that\nOh man so these are really fun um a lot of them and love\nWrapping a empty beer bottle with a piece of string that you do an actual tone and waiting it on fire [noise]\nUm so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases of creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer and you can turn it into a a glass to drink a glass to then\nPut beer and um I'd recommend you know standing heavily on the edge to protect your mouth\nI'm can create ... charges or that you can put outside a ward off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a number of other can make shot glasses I'm with the basically the the bottle next um that you've severed off\nIn Columbus lifetime licenses cannot be purchased that license agent

tonight\nOh good good yeah it's uh the weather has definitely turn to early in the week it was hot and\nCold yeah yeah so I you know I've got to go on and I you know my wife once I told her she had a big buck in front of her blind she said All right let's let's break out the camera let's get going so we're going to head out to a place in ... where we can now what we can do do you have any special plans for this a cool autumn weekend\nBut not not as of yet now who knows what will come up\nYeah yeah well you know we got some we got some Buckeye football watcher at noon and yeah and uh we got our browns or tomorrow which uh uh they they did is right last week so there's you know there's you you don't need to plan out every hour of every weekend that's\nExactly right yeah whatever comes up comes up\nWhatever comes up one of my favorite times of the years coming up obviously with upland game season opening I got an an English Setter who is just a a pheasants are are her passion and I understand you've got some information on a on the releases\nYeah there's going to be fourteen thousand pheasants released ban on three days a this year or the the smoking hunting season begins on November second but it you know this program has been going on since Nineteen Nineteen\nThat's incredible that's uh now I didn't you know I I did a piece for a couple of years ago about where I I don't think I realized that had been taken a going on for that that long a time and it's one that's just it's you know people love it and if ...\nIf you're going to fence and Ohio let's face it you're going to be an stock\nYeah very much for the most sorrow for the most part in ... you know it for me you know I started hunting certainly not in the heyday the heyday pheasant hanging Ohio was you know the fifties and sixties\nI missed out on that but I was in on it in the eighties when I thought oh boy I Wish it was as good as it used to be not ... those were the modern good old days exactly and I would actually I Would bypass the pheasant releases because I I knew I had a good shot at it at hunting\nI'm wild birds and I didn't want to I didn't want to eliminate to from the bag you know I didn't want it\nYeah take a take a bird from release you know in miss out on being able to up to hunt for two birds in a single day when there was a reasonable chance to get to get your living a wild birds and non birds that are awesome ...\nNow Nineteen Nineteen Dan Ohio opened the first game farm operation Wellington wildlife area up in northeast Ohio\nNow see I thought it was her ban it but it's it's\nNot ha gets willing to what Nineteen thirty your Urbana game farmers per day on the hot division of conservation wasn't even called the division of wildlife yet ... so that was Nineteen\nThirty ... thirty to sixty four year ban of game farm raised about a hundred and fifty thousand is\nYeah so it's been going on for a long time\nAnd and fun stuff up you know I followed those guys around a couple of years ago from you know went out to help help them collect the birds and and release them and release them and all and it's interesting 'cause they do they released some I remember back in the day um they would release them in the afternoon both for\nThe weekend so they go out and karate afternoon and release them and they figured out that there was like trucks you know people kind of following I'm\nSure where they're really so now they make it a point to release them after shooting time so there is releasing them in the evening hours\nSo that you know hundreds can't immediately just pounds on where the where the ... ... when it landed and um and and they also kind of scatter around um where they released from now if you want to trick one of the word of the think God do I want to share this or not I don't think I did on\nA one of the things that I Do after release and I I learned is taking my son and and and one of my nephews out hunting for youth season is\nI Would go to the wildlife area that we frequent and actually look for ups\nUm leading beyond the parking area in other words you're that you're ... you're not allowed to go farther the only people that could drive further than that our wildlife trucks right the thing in our yeah so I'm figuring okay if they're a fresh\nTracks leading into the wildlife area from the designated party or your chances are pretty good it was a truck that release birds the night before\nRight there is some isn't there some pheasants in there the other thing that I Do is I've got\nA pheasant call I've got a a chemical called it's just like a duck call but it makes it ... yeah and I'll break that out sometimes an al ... and it doesn't happen every time it doesn't happen most of the time but it it happens often enough that I'll get a reply no kid from those\nRelease birds because they're very vocal they you know they all grew up together and they're very vocal they haven't learned yet that if they tackle a coyote you know could come and get them or yeah or ... or something so they're more vocal and wild birds so I'll take that cackle call with me and if I'm really you know getting stumped\nOr at least neither direction to go I'll ... and if I get a reply that I Know which way to send us at her home\nI'll just yeah just a little tricks\nOf the tree parts of the trade learned after forty years to
