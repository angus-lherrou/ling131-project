E. D. I. N. eaten W. S. P. D. in Toledo WTO wage in Columbus W. V. ex gee in Marion in Wilmington W. K. after I we got the statewide upland hunting season coming up on friday I've got two of the top a\nBiologist I'm In that business with me today in the studio I Am joined here by Nathan stricter and Joseph ... of the Ohio division of wild like I'd like to welcome you guys up to ...\nThank you damn good morning I think you could morning You're welcome it's fun because ah Nathan I typically we've been talking for about a decade\nOr this week or every year up to get the upland forecasts to get information on pheasants and that sort of thing so it's fun to have you in the studio is my first time so this is pretty exciting usually I'm Talking to you on the phone yes yes and I brought you down to the beautiful\nUh I'm Out of sports radio studios and um we're happy to have you here as well as you just have just if you're sort of a newbie with the division\nYep I started last December um and I moved down from a northern\nWhere in northern Michigan I was working into St Marie Michigan and the other hand and so yeah you bet yes spend a lot of ... sent a lot of time there that's where I get my I pronounce it wrong\n... yup yup okay\nYes I actually I'm driving through there are a lot because I I had the UP\nI'm near Ralph and ... and which lake and and wild lake in those areas up in the north central part of the UP for grad school because it's an excellent country progress we are all men yes yes yes and but we're in good country were good country for pheasants right Ohio a his hat higher number of peasants than in the past\nAnd and that is sort of your expertise is a pheasants and I'm an ... if that's correct okay um\nThe few that I actually harvested what kind of expect to see a come friday\nSo Britain numbers are pretty similar to last year although in some ways we did see an increase a slight increase in in ... I'm number ... service from the spring I'm areas that have had high present numbers in the past and such as Williams county in areas in the ... river watershed where the ... sorry\nUm have have remained pretty stable\nOkay you're talking about them and again eighth and I were talking about the ... a ... program\nUm where there are some grass has planted along some of the drainage is um one of the things that I Know I was pretty excited about the ... when I heard about the say the crap and um\nAnd the first couple of times I hunted them because I Do have farms that allow me to hunt on them and the the grasses where I hunt often have a pink or read tinge to them or\nDo you what would those be more than likely\nWe have the set of crap and what we're talking about is yeah it's a USDA program where landowners receive payments to enroll acres they're basically paid to provide habitat for pheasants and other up in the wildlife\nAnd B you unique thing about ... crap\nIs that it was Seventy thousand acres that went into the side of the watershed so we're basically talking about an area that drains from North of Columbus up near the uh uh ... all the way down to the Ohio River following that say to a record or\nAnswer Seventy thousand acres of habitat and it was not there before had been crop yields soy beans corn like we were talking about a little bit earlier\nUm so the dominant grasp of the day was planted in there and there's been fairly aggressive in its growth is is Indian grass and so you know Ohio was blessed with new good moisture lots of rainfall and very fertile soils\nSo am I made a warrant season grasses you might see yeah out west on the prairie states Oklahoma Kansas and so on\nWe see a very robust growth of these Indian grasses and so they grow up they grow about seven or eight feet out they get to very thick you know difficult for hunters to yeah\nTo walk through some times much less the dogs in less than their managed property\nYeah and that's what I was getting to you nailed that because I was very excited about this because I'm thinking okay it's going to be knee high to waste high like the old C. R. P. stuff\nAnd ... I mean this stuff ... until winner wins in snow kind of knocked down which is another reason we we like it because that's the kind of grass or that provides a cover under under the snow right because it's sort of bends down in the in the birds can get underneath it and and stay warm and stay out of the elements in a little bit\nIn the case there's heavy snows yeah you do get it to ... down you actually want those stems this heavy grass stems to remain robustness standing just now because they still have seed hasn't top\nSo whenever the wind blows is knocking the seeds off of the seed heads onto the snow and so you know we talked about winter mortality who one of the things that that causes winter murder mortality whether it's quail pheasant and so on isn't so much of the cold temperatures and freezing is just lack of food their food gets covered up\nAnd so when we see you extended snowfall on the ground you know seven to ten days especially\nLike we are seeing some years\nIs covering up all the food the birds like quail don't scratch the way a chicken might to get down to where the food is and so they really were rely on these robust grasses and other forms wildflowers\nThat remain standing in that little bit of snow and then as the wind blows knock seeds off lands on top of the snow and so you provided a good food source so it it's a good robust food source through the winter for upland game\nI'm Glad you mentioned quail um I in some of the news that I received from the division of wildlife I noticed that um\nI think one of the places that they're excited about a couple of places where they're seeing some success with quail um if if I wanted to head out at some point during the up and she's been with my English Setter and go to a public hunting area in hopes of of getting hurt appointed quail where where am I going to go\nAnd there are several areas in southwest Ohio oh we were just down that they're the false wildlife area ... few days doing quail counts down there\nAre typically we do a spring camp we're listening for those whistling males defending their territories and trying to attract females this time of year and it's a different type of call birds are coming together and what's referred to as a cubby usually anywhere from seven to a dozen birds and are they huddled together at night to stay warm\nAnd also offer each other protection and so early morning the give kind of a signal call to others to let them know hey we made it through the night we're still here\nAnd uh that's where we listen for so our falls below my life very damning Harlan County or Indian creek wildlife area down and brown county and the little bit further west north of Cincinnati get into the rush run wildlife area over there in that they have some decent quail numbers down there\nOkay Joseph Mitt opposes same question to you do you with regard to pheasants if um\nIf someone wanted to hunt public land I'm and I'm going to ask about wild peasants first because I Know there are areas that you guys specifically do not stock in hopes of nurturing a populations of wild birds where would we want to go up we wanted to uh to to point wild pheasants [noise]\nUh we have decent wealth as in populations at lake lost when while at very up and Williams county at big island while at very in Marion County and then the ... creek wildlife area and pick way and they can be\nOkay I've also and I found it to all of those but the last two and a killed their eye and again that's real near big island uh basically um I had a little bit of luck there as well as well there with do I want to say this on the air uh woodcock if I Want to shoot a woodcock in Ohio I had to killed her\nAnd some of the swamp be grounds there when the lights are coming\nKilled there is a good area the big island wildlife areas another area at the the nice thing about those two areas is that there are a mix of wetlands as well as the grasslands and big island wildlife area especially you have some of the side of the river you know running near there\nAnd so this bottom lands where the ... to ... to to be really farm\nYou have some young trees coming in mix of trees grasses what areas that really is attractive for woodcock especially during the migration at this time\n[noise] All right we are talking to judge of Latin Bach and Nathan stricter they had a vision of wildlife are going to switch to rabbits\nAnd our next segment okay sounds good I Will be right back more for the buckeyes force [noise]\n\nFaking this Buckeye sportsmen with Dan armored
