I never I don't think I've ever said that were true I never had to pronounce it but I've read it\nRight the ... okay\nAnd or the Mets is a it's a French acronym the word maps and English it means precision equipment for sports for sport fishing really correct and uh\nAnd uh\nThat's that's something that's\nIn history right there are about the about the name and as far as the lure itself a it was brought up the maps Akeley was brought back after World War two from a GI who is making his way back to the states from Europe\nNow and he so he got it when he was over in France obviously brought you to bring it back to the u._s. you did\nOkay All right now there's also a children's incorporated too is is is that the parent company\nYeah it's\nSo under a under shelters there's maps and there's Mr twister\nOkay Mr twister to alright\nAnd shoved into the home and maps so if you want to think of it that way it showed his children's is the home of maps tied showed and discovered the map spinner\nAnd Nineteen fifty one and um and it's still a family run business to this day\nAnd okay All right we are talking to Josh ... he's a communications director for maps ... is it Anna go am I pronouncing indigo Wisconsin correctly\nYou are an NGO Wisconsin or the local here they dropped the tea so it's and they go over and go but um\nAnd to go it's perfectly fine okay [laughter]\nWell ... I already referenced you know how long I've I've known about the the the name maps when I was a little kid I think it was that in ... you know original floater were two of the first lures I save my lunch money to buy and I remember seeing the the reddish you know the the the the tale I remember reading a story about NGOs using this maps\nSpinner and they thought that the red\nFeather sticking out from the reddish for really is we're sort of the ticket I remember reading that\nAnd so I went in and found one and bought one and what I'm describing is you're you're most famous ... the map spinner right and it's got it is the trouble hook is trimmed with a is a foxtail score or Fox Fox world do\nWe do have some with Fox squirrels tail and then some great squirrels tail\nOkay All right and and the deal here is you guys need squirrel tales\nAbsolutely yeah that's one thing that uh we're always in need of um in fact\nDriving by our facility uh there's probably forty five and that's that's the main the main road and there's a sign squirrel tales wanted to have a we have a son and\nDon't you into the public um and that's and that's for that reason because we absolutely have a need for ...\nOkay and so my listeners who have squirrels tales you can send them in and and you can either get money for it or you can get credit against um lures is that correct\nThat is correct yes if you can you can opt to ah get a check for the amount of grow tells you bring us or or you can ... you can double the value of your squirrels tails and trade for looters\nAnd that's significant because you get you guys will pay up to twenty six cents for each tail\nRight or act that's over a thousand tails I'm OK\nTells you over those and then so\nThe amounts per tail\nUm that's not that's not the main folks in the program the main focus is to be it's a conservation program I'm encouraging hunters and anglers to when they when they when they get squirrels instead of throwing them away um send us the tails and we can recycle that valuable resource\nWe don't want anything to go to waste so that that's really the main focus and the fact that we we offer something I'm a dollar value for the tales that that's a bonus to the program and\nEven more so when you can double that value in trade polluters\nOkay All right what's the chance of someone doting donating a tail and having and then being able to buy the lure of the movies made from the for from the tail but they don't it\nWhat's the chance you said yeah but one in two million not\nKnow it really depends on the monitors that they bring to they bring us\nQuite so well you know so you said that the twenty six cents is based on a thousand tells none of my listeners are going to have a thousands world feels so if you've got\nTens world tales you'll take them\nCorrect yeah we'll take 'em I Would say twelve twelve tales\nIf someone to bring us twelve tales then with that amount if the ... are graded and they were they were premium tales they will be able to get 'em aside zero size you want to lure\nWith with that amount that's great and another thing now does anything over fifty tells the shipping reimbursed oh All right go you know it it does happen\nWhere over a couple of seasons go by and and they they started chosen the freezer um and that's really a crucial point of if you started the tails the right way I'm In the freezer they won't\n... ... um again it it sounds that sounds obvious but it's something that we want to reinforce because we do get deals that spoil 'em and then sending us details in a in a cardboard box Mitt is the best option um the smallest the smallest box possibilities and they get\nIs gonna is gonna mean that the less shipping that that there that people will pay to ... at the center said\nYes yes so what's the proper okay so I say shooter squirrels today later on today [noise] um what ... what should I Do I mean what's the method to chop it off close to the you know I've never seen a a squirrel tail\nSo chop it off as close to the main body as possible and uh you don't want to put in like ... in it like I Do turkey tail feathers\nOr you can do that as long it could for actors drying agent that that would work um I Would say ... or so a strong salt water solution\nMhm and keep the bone and the tail okay the bone details have no value to us so it's a crucial point again to mention to keep the bone and the tail\nAnd for that reason is when when we tie when we retire dressed hooked on the tail or that bone gives 'em gives the workers something to hold onto as they clip hair off the tail\nInteresting All right All right and then\nMake sure make sure the tails flat while is drying hotels again I'm not worth as much\nIt's not worth as much and you're going to get your best dollar if you if you follow the care and handling of the tail and we have those under ... maps dot com slash squirrel tail\nAlright so as we wrap up here are listeners who want to sell their squirrels tales can get all the information they need by going to maps that's M. E. P. P. S. dot com slash squirrel tail\nCorrect maps dot com slash squirrels or maps dot com slash squirrels dash to a squirrel dash hail\nAll right Josh thank you for sharing that information on this uh kind of a cool program how many years has has this been going on how long has been buying squirrel pills from hunters\nMore than half a century", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Buckey Sportsman with Dan Armitage", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "20"}
