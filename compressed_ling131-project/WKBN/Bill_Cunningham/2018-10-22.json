is pushing toward the U.S border ABC's ... minutes in southern Mexico\nToward America has made an Enron this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers have swelled to about ten thousand\nAnd every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do and the F. word all these things are shouted against our president\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor aboard to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way and the Texas Nevada Arizona and basically the media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur like Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice South American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million\nWhat would that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here and because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico too you know the words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic card that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled\nTo have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats as extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here legally you're going to take and right back immediately\nIf you're from Central America you have the right to herring that goes on and on and on and never stops so uh I I'm interested to see when and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminal societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes ... New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border sixteen of the twenty most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world was because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head the terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran has on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people opioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand\nMore in your community please bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin\nAnd Michigan to vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live I'm Sorry and I wish there was some way through the magic wand that\nWe go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life\nThat don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through prophecies we've taken legally one point one million foreigners to come into America take the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here and watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now that will never happen this is fundamentally changed our country that is far\nAnd it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or\nThe Senate if that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospitals ready to go ... or the bridges and roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible\nThat's the most violent places on earth is sending its largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later an African American leader of great no there's no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they have figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit the American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have\nBenefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that we are\nYou mean Jamal could show a Saudi Arabian killed and turkey is more important to us now to brave police officer who gave his life\nIs

Democrats across the country [noise]\nAnd he's probably going to be down at the border and a week or so they're trying to get over a hundred thousand I Hope I said before you know by the time spring hits the fan President Trump is already said he's not used in the reserves you use a real army\nAnd I think the plan is they want to be like another state kinds of ours and we got our troops on the

Connecticut but in Connecticut which is a deep blue state in financial difficulty\nI does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump\nWhere I live in Ohio we don't want ... will happily\nTake one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals ... most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nIn ... in Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the critical person in Connecticut has been a legal immigrant tens of thousands of southern hair thanks to governor mulloy to put my past year and a half the Blumenthal every time these legal immigrants ISIS the court them they hold up to her shirt\nBlumenthal shows up at church or other Congress people from Connecticut in front of the TV cameras and they plead their case these people should be allowed to stay blah blah blah and eventually the ice a suspense their case you know for future here he's in front of the TV cameras all all the\nTime trying to see the eagle illegal immigrants here in Connecticut\nAnd you know it's disgusting and remember remember here's the deal if you're from Mexico and get caught you're sent back immediately because of the law if you're from Central America\nAnd you said the magical words I'm a refugee and I want to hearing you get in line with a couple of million others and you never ever

not scaled are doing\nIt's continuing ed in Las Vegas Nevada and they add welcome to the bill Cunningham show ed please go ahead\nYes first of all the FBI or us national security establishment should investigate and find out who's funding the current current boys or that\nOr whatever they are called uh they can't have that capability and they should find out who's doing it also kind of Obama drone American citizens like this hour we keep guy kill them all up you know ...\nAnd then the media doesn't change you know they give you much later they killed as a sixteen year old son\nWell and it's because you know ... if ... if in the view of CNN 'cause she'll get can be used as a club or against Trump they'll do it\nBut they're out of whack he's being killed by Obama's no big deal the Iowa college kid raped and killed by that a legal immigrant or that was quickly dropped she's gone a cops that are killed on a regular basis no big deal\nIn fact that ... that kind of behavior not part of the world\nIs regular that's what goes on there and I don't like it much\nBut I think seeing that doesn't like the fact that Israel is become friendly with Saudi Arabia I mean when I heard Trump and somehow I hear Trump's comments about journalist and then I hear about the show again as if Trump indirectly killed the guy that is what CNN get do and why why is his life more valuable than a cops life\nMPR ... which is subsidized by the taxpayer says the same I end up look at the head of the past set of who's back to stand in the oil as political or on a ... portion Obama and Secretary Clinton looked at the other way that guy because we need it the face to supply Afghanistan\n... says African Business conference that Obama held ... the African leaders and I think that\nItaly male newspaper looked at it and it was the ... gallery of human rights violators and corrupt officials but\nYou know the media like CNN and MSNBC and and the are they just fall over how the great Obama was reaching

too small\nMilitary bases are too small we're talking about tens of thousands a month\nComing into America we don't have the money it doesn't work what needs to happen is the federal law needs to be

you're not an American the Democrats\nTend Democrats in the Senate will not allow that to happen they will not allow that change Trump wanted to get the so called dreamers might be twenty million

about an hour and twenty minutes I'm gonna call Peter Wallison he's written a book about the bureaucracy the so called deep state how\nThat continues that continues today three thousand new rules and regulations a year hundreds every month it never stops is going on right now Trump's trying to stop but he's going to make that he made the point in his book that I read\nThat that it cannot be stopped that there's a deep state in Washington that will continue even assuming Trump is there for eight years it will not be stopped that's his point he might agree\nBut I Would agree with that completely\nAnd I I Want to tell you you know these people that protested against a governor governor I mean judge Kavanaugh right they were led by the Democratic party for a specific reason they don't want constitutional judges on the Supreme Court oh\nNo they\n... they don't want a super legislature they they won judges to impose rules and regulations on us that cannot be passed through the Democratic process\nAnd so they've done that the last thirty or forty years and when you got Gorsuch and Kevin ... who ... oh I Hope become constitutional judges they're going to say wait a minute if you want to convince your fellow citizens to have abortion or gay marriage or something else\nGo convince them in the legislature passed a law it's OK don't come to us to services second legislature and I hope that the Kevin O's Gorsuch and Roberts and Alito and and the Thomas I I Hope that's what\nThat's what they do in the future is don't come to us to impose new rules in the American people go to the legislature go to the Congress go to the stage go to the city is going to the counties that's where it belongs\n[laughter] you know the Democratic party bill ... one ... in a ... a sure

it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby\nWho sits in print than at the age of Eighteen years old and American icon\nSits in prison in his eighties over

then the bigger double than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me too\nIs a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood lefty [laughter] okay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on your news and these old school actresses and all these ...

decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being a bill ends up being part of a well being used against Kavanaugh being used against\nThe high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born a the lecturers activities of left us in Hollywood that and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms positions with somebody ah Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein and access Harvey Weinstein was uh making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas so they sent their own daughters end of the care custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there and a daughter that you don't that you got to be concerned about cause harm people take advantage of them but the the what the what rocket bombing selling us\nI have so much power I Know that this guy the lecture is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with him but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a

take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere\nWhich is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants coming through a Guatemala into Mexico there right now it's three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in and we're in Honduras living the\nHorrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime the first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand it completely but along the process it

so you didn't pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to give drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign\nOr buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others in order to uh to me are Republicans all over the country getting you know you give me over the next two weeks ... how's this going to play out at like ... or early on November the sex\nBut Democrats have missed every fine they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate people want our border protected and so they and they also get that this is fake news that's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand now\nAnd so what prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing your aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look if these people get where you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we're going to look at the age that we're able to send to you\nSo Mexico's deploying military on the southern border so I just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it\nHonduras I bet you will send buses the say you've got to you're going to get back to our country or else\n... and ... what the ... how they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand they think that there's some issue that is going to be the guy the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want\nSo whether whether it's the kind you fact whether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's this farce of an investigation of the Russian they'll which we now see that that is completely been bussed in part because the judge Royce Lamberth\nWho just said I don't understand how Cheryl Mills isn't in prison you know and and Clinton a bunch of others and then there's a conspiracy with

Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the record is very important because I think he is the\nRoad [noise] ah the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrator state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers\nAnd then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nRight I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center for business\nThis of course it it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for businesses one of the estimates that I had in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nDo that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on cruel other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses or from individuals each year\nSo this is a very significant thing um but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe [laughter] the idea here and described in the book is that the courts can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation\nUnder which all of these rules are made and very frequently um the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if she were all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule\nAnd there are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the digital forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia in Seventeen Ninety seven\nArticle one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "22"}
