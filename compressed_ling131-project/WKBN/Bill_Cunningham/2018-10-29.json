happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he a friend that was ... who else knew what he ... he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel\nAnd Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history Deb Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions as I have\nAnd so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews one Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo or one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt it's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat simulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's chili Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I\nWant to know\nThe immediate reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson\nAttempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a mortar wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day ran\nA story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the Capitol take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter\nA frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\n[noise] over the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people there have been at least\nTwenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder\nFor many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or

the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home\nOf Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out to restaurants and\nAlso when Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right committing acts of

[noise]\n\nI've only counting others continue with the tragedy the tragedies is weak and the one that happened\nOn Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite\nWho kept below the radar most of the reporting on this uh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nHeavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas rescue and former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas rushed getting welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nA very tough situation awful um but\nAnd afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all and I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy\nAnd he said oh goodbye no difficulties he had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nAnd today did ugly reporting saying that ah\nThat in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a\nFew hours you know the set is there any tragedy the Washington Post war not exploit do attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI not as of yet when I've seen\nIs you know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was honoring his tweets his social media is other things that he was hosting couldn't have alerted only\nWhat the one we always say is your mom thing say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene\nAnd could've alerted the police on the police we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about Bowers and do something or or look to see this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nWe can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people had called about an Eighteen year old a punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nNo perfection on horse but you're only as good a shift today and wish I could go on for civilians very easy to do after the same\nLaw enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD we always look back we oh we used to it at ... view of what had happened and what we could do but at the same way that they're doing with the case and the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours waiting for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlights these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people ... of like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews\nAnd against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had it goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you were in NYPD or you go right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of you know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying it and it's the matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be dial back because you're pressing police departments\nTo their ... degree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he had failed terrorism school and couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed\nIf not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to some of the guy who was sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd going into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas Ross can former NPD NYPD officer thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and all of us need to learn the rhetoric just a little bit because there's nuts everywhere Thomas

Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend about you\nGo let me share with the American people something you've uh put forth in the morning you miss them and that is what's going on and with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some sense closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border with migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather\nAs accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized done by political agitator as an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not continue on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden\nSeven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that so what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media will do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of a you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt\nA you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to stay out of this you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states in let's let's be honest here\nIs that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your and my life time though I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh\nCaravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAre not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTo Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about
