I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin Oh she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault an abuse should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kevin O's line and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse but\nAlso care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rapist to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who spent a combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that are allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it got an innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate in other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford they completely falling apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator her own uh of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven ... of the Late Show as a terrible late

show Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh's life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is

brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of Brett Kavanaugh as his wife his mom and dad is girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nOf some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accuser is all that kind of stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was the title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of\nThe facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now clowns fools to come out of the woodwork to like Valerie Jarrett ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the\nDemocrats claim to care about women but uh over the years or one of the largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they're really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael Evan Eddie the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography and that opened the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about\nIf they cared about sexual assault or women than their leader would not be\nThe U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota if they really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and joining sixteen if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with ... probably eight or nine times out of ten is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy\nAnd by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fear that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really are left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story

want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged\nI Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction\nOf substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process to determine what she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later after she testified what about\nDays ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened that how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out in fact she was a safe and some of these other factors come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally because the front door went in and twenty eight not\nTwenty twelve and at one end not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist one at the rent a part of her house and she wanted to separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door and had nothing to do with cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and Europe\nShe had no fear of flying it was a lie in fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth\nThey had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't

progressive are incapable of analyzing facts\nWhether it be about climate change or whether it be utilized but that Dr Ford present it in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie I Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kevin ... in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\n\nAnd really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our morals\nDirector and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yeah I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political forces the only way that we are going to come and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beating them at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where does this sea of red\nFrom seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts\nAnd look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nFrom Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't get a venue today to Eric\nHolder who contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven says conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never question but let me see if the promise but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate you process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall and the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results remmer elections if he felt it was rigged against him in the media Hillary Clinton in New York Times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a core sailor was going to win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and the major media has not accepted the outcome in the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media and went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she never accepted the ballot box New York times never accepted the fact that Trump won so they became what they\nCriticize it it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe in New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show and New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nAnd Mr Cunningham thank you for taking my call um agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important to have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSimon and his book code red about a ... vote and Russian Freud in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words\nAnd and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there was hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance 'cause there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're a code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the ... and the companies that manufacture than they are only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where\nThe Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nThe machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the ... term who's on the ballot what have you on the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm\nWould take away from the Republican the end of the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when George ...

Bob and Marilyn welcome to the bill Cunningham show Bob how are you\nA great bill great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that that she doesn't care what happened she is glad she Brett Kavanaugh's life wonderful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh will they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nAll remind entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten or at the nice things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do [noise] ah it will provide a great context for\nThe situation that we're in your Catholic as my are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in these sects abuses and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those laws and we should be held to account let me\nTell you this Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator wanted the church undermined from within to neutralize the cemeteries and to eliminate the healing power of the church the the the free and empower the church\nIn this country a woman named ballot died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties but late twenties and for\nTwenty years I\nIntroduced into the seminary place than at the American Catholics\nSeminaries one thousand one hundred men who were communists and or no overload faith or morals and according to the plot many who was a sexually deviant once that was established then successive waves brought in more of these people and they work their way into the priesthood and ultimately into the higher or\nI may say this if if the devil himself\nWanted to destroy the Roman Catholic faith he would have done exactly what many praised up and do in the past forty or fifty years and I want to go to deep and it is but if the devil himself wanted to destroy Catholicism the devil could not done done a better job than what I see

the Republican Party\nWhich has become conservative of light and the president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban to run against\nAnd Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\nIt ... you know I don't come in and got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems and a lot of rain that they hate that personal background in their lives and that they can get anything anything they want to
