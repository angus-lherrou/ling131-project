[noise] uh Kathy Akron, Ohio your next Hi Cathy Lee a report the guy\nThat you're taking my call thank you it's my pleasure thanks for calling\nI've been wanting to attack you for a while I had a private hobby where I collect a landscape photos and um I Would really like find a way to is like ... as like it you don't say\nOh how nice and digital trains are usually kinda small and yeah let's have it on the banks shuttering ... but I don't know how to do that\nYou know it's funny because almost all now these uh Internet connected TV devices like the Roku and the Apple TV have screens divers that are often landscapes Apple TV as a beautiful uh one of the slow motion landscapes so they're moving 'cause their screen saver\nAnd I saw that on a TV yesterday horse yeah location that I figured it was probably felt the television\nThere comes to the Apple TV it's awesome so that would be one way to do it is to get one of these devices\nAll of them have a photo capability so for instance the Apple TV if you use a Macintosh you upload your landscape pictures to your you put them on your apple photos and you could actually have a particular folded let's call it my special landscape collection\nAnd you say to your Apple TV [noise] that's my screen saver\nHow does it get from my ...\nYou know through the through iCloud it's through the Internet and that's the whole point is that you are now now this is not the only way to do it I'm gonna tell you some other way\nBut that's one way to do it and the advantage of that as you can updated without having to do anything and just put new photos in the folder on your computer and the way it works is you you using the iCloud photo library So Apple the Mac\nIs uploading all your photos to iCloud its its cloud storage\nThat yeah yeah yeah I can I tell them\nThat Apple TV it's called the Apple TV [noise] and so the idea is that this is one way I'm going to finish until you some other ways but it's because it's got costs you money because Apple TV is a couple of hundred bucks\nBut then the Apple TV let you watch movies and TV and and other stuff you know it's the idea is that it makes an Internet connected TV see connect the Apple TV to the Internet now your TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capability to your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix Ani do yeah\nI Do like we we can get on you know like you I ... to it and he I was\nOkay so it doesn't already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that\nPhoto op lots of TVs have slots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an ... memory card on Yahoo hack\nFlooded into TV you can buy if your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that the only\nThe ad on edge steak yeah\nThat's the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that as the carts water on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that\nOr the nice thing about the Apple TV that will work with any TV that has an H poor\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service it you know you could use some other one Amazon has at those Amazon fired TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos in your back and put the photos and that\nAnd then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this ah because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance on my\nToes [laughter] yeah yeah that would be great tip [noise]\nSo you could do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there lots of ways to do it and it's in your right it'd be great way to use those landscape photos\n[noise] excellent thank you my\nPleasure and if you have an Apple TV\nI stopped putting my family photos on their cars the a normal a default screen saver what's it called Ariel is stunning\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo a and it just rotates through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of like that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the classic bark thing as the zoom down that valley but they do it very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but then I Want to change dramatically or drugs the guy so it's just beautiful\nIf you have your

after when I was\nIt was friends with Steve and in this man I got to play and I saw this guy\nSang and played around on stage he was planning on leave incredible guitar player\nAnd I thought oh you can time is ten o'clock\n... brothers can be deterring fine hard was Nineteen eighty\nFive seven\nI'm Gary all thing our border security getting new attention just weeks ahead of the midterm election looking at a lot of\nThings really what we want to do is change immigration laws because they were there were a laughing stock all over the world\nSo uh I was oh shut off to the side\nAnd I waited there about a half an hour forty five minutes wonder if it's going to happen or not I have the equipment with me so a a nice woman comes as the president's ready to see you know and I said well thank you so I walked hair walked back around came around the corner presidents like twenty feet away says bill hold on I'll be right with you\nI said I'm not going anywhere [laughter] I'm a I'm not going anywhere I'm right here\nSo it came up with some nice days he says he listens to me casually on Sunday night and thanks for what I Do on television for him I said no problem I Believe in what you're doing and I said to him I said look either concerning twenty sixteen\nNow when you got elected you were going to be like in New York Republican kind of a moderate Republican you've turned out to be well beyond my expectations I said you make Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal Democrat\nWhat you're doing is that is fabulous away exchange to more nicely these small talk and said you ready for it I said let's go so I handed him my Mike and I took a Mike\nAnd I talked to him for like Thirteen minutes talked a little bit about the rally\nHappening a couple of hours later friday night we talked about the tariffs about Canada and Mexico talked about a a show gay talked about South Korea whenever the ashes Kevin all whatever it was talking about Thirteen minutes and I said I'm going to run it Sunday night is that I may be listening\nAs well Mr President thank you very much so we're going to play that interview and about a twenty twenty five minutes at\nThe bottom and then later on and we have a Bill O'Reilly coming up and also a diamond in silk or I think fabulous and diamond in silk reminded me hit him on two or three months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal part isn't\nVoting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal partisan group for the Democratic party\nThan African Americans especially every American women\nSome as diamonds silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN honored Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBut courage sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nSo he's you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him\nHe's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they've had it with him as she spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her\nAnd and it really couldn't have got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational on a madman snoop doggy dog eat dog eat citizen uncle\nTom and so entertainers comics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jesse ... Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson and ... and others for being\nDisloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them\nPractically every chance they have ... ... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's prone after policies\nWhich have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled apply families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married\nIt goes on and on and on and this was all set in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... and what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks\nMaintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test and other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause the sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control we have well I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat is why CNN working with a Democrat\nI Know the top of the last to our Web Bill O'Reilly O'Reilly factor is on tonight also in about an hour or so we have diamond in suburban are going to call in from the Carolinas to talk about how black women support someone like Donald Trump when the media attacks black to get jump out of line much like a southern slave owners would keep blacks are dumb down and illiterate\nThat's the goal of the modern Democratic Party to keep them in line with continued thirty minutes after they are still counting undergrad American live with you [noise] every something [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] we had in the mid term election you'll hear

had so here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater headed\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you you have a long distance relationship here I Do I have had ... ships I had swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up [noise] we uh eleven hundred and sixty four units are remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of it by ... that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there now\nAnd knocked down about six months ago a really yellow and gone the whole thing including the garbage everything's on what's going to happen with the making of housing development oh okay\nGood but it was great for us we fixed it and sold it for more money and uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the quaint said he\nWas talking about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was it to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got back here we got back I it we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion and uh we got him back and\nHe's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off and he'll be at the office he'll\nBe in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy right now about your wife is good she's a lawyer\nTo Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty it was very sad and beautiful in one way and very Saturn and other kids were beautiful they loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just that one of the human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had\nA big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I look at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're gonna have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because there was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making refused so we call it the U.S embassy\nAnd it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we're just going to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico will be talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nAnd we'll make it a lot of steps and just when we're doing for TV should when he'll he's really good and he should win but uh I Will be very upset if he tested but I think he's going to\nIs the president it you're the best you're a great

ridiculous about our hat and a jacket that she wore and a fashion statement she was making it's just ridiculous how the media coverage that you know\nMedia Research Center and my friend Brent ... says that Ninety three percent of the media coverage\nOf Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the media objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody stopped in the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's groupthink because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction we're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right\nThirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors house the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing conservative\nWhat CBS what's safe from top to bottom or going to resolve well we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and then ABC NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox you know if they're leaning left quite often was Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night Sean draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of interviews I just conduct it was a regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple and it would become the dominant evening\nNewscast if somehow one of the other ones would say you know what from top to bottom we're going to reflect the values of people in this country that that are pro God pro family pro military pro police and we're going to reflect that all you gotta do is look at Newsmax TV\nOr a one American network and you'll find conservative values in the news that reflects the American people so let's continue with calls from California\nTexas North Carolina Louisiana and Ohio\nHave long becomes available number to call his eight six six six or seven seven

now we're just men to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs which don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal and they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before but now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union is ...\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years I mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "15"}
