{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "But it's a statement that I Would definitely agree with you know I you know and I want to follow up that question if you could talk about that if you could also talk about you know Trump to the major thing I mean as far as renegotiating NAFTA with Canada and Mexico to make it a a ... a better deal for the United states\nHe's now focusing on China in his argument is China needs us more than ... them they need our marketplace they're going to come around to I'd like to comment on that as well\nI'm In saying that now for the past two years and I agree with that statement I've never agree more\nEven economists to cannot stand President Trump say he's right um they need us you know you're not buying hundred dollar Nike shoes or if you're if you're if you're working for three dollars an hour and you're living in a in a hot somewhere in your your second John as as a rice fields\nYou're just not but you are you are buying those you are buying which China you are buying their trinkets if you're working for thirty three bucks an hour of benefits of GM or if you're working you're working on the shop\nYou know whatever for for X Y or Z Corporation they absolutely need the western civilization for that seat they absolutely need\nUnited States to succeed on their economy has the reason why they haven't caught her debt they know they need us and yes absolutely we truly do not need now\nAre they ... for for our our employers out there that are there are sending jobs over to them to you know for a less regulation and three to five bucks an hour on you know waitress you know maybe they need them but I've got to tell you the\nAmerica overall has had enough of that there's there's definitely been an internal war being waged in America here to where\nPeople are pro America Again people are I Know me I'm going to pick her up lock her product or service if I Know my fellow guy or my fellow woman\nOr are they are making that and that's a point now and a lot of people feel that way so uh that underlines exactly go all the way down to ... exactly how and why I Believe that statement to be true and and I got to tell you I got to bounce it back to you\nDo you believe that\nDo I believe that this is the best economy\nOr oh no I actually that you know I I Know you you know we don't need that I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you I think the guy is brilliant I think Trump starts with an extreme position\nA of tariffs and he throws at all against these people who've been screwing us for years and then he gets to where he wants to go where it's fair to the United states and it's a better deal for the United states and he takes this stuff away and that's how we bring some of the table and I think he's doing the same thing with China in essence\nI get frustrated with the media 'cause I think the media wants him to say oh I'm only kidding there we're going to wait and see he's not going to reveal a strategy he's not going to tell anybody listen I'm going to come at these guys with Tara someone to come after him with everything\nAnd they're going to come to us because they need our marketplace and I'm going to get a better deal for the United states when it comes to screw in us on our patents in this kind of stuff\nJust like when I watch Lesley Stahl tried to say last I Can't just say something nasty about this world leader that were a leader and he didn't fall into that trap because he's he's trying to get things from these people are to reach ... we're reaching agreements as opposed to saying on network TV this guy's an ass\nWell there's either dealmaker and remember this Ron [laughter] when I worked for John what's known as an actor in every he said in ... someone's getting salt\nPeriod you're either getting so old that they don't want the item you're selling or here or there getting sold that you are getting ... they want the items on period and and and at the end of the day is a secret negotiator his job is to play the best steak deck of cards\nThat he can even including with Ronald Reagan when he made a Russia's believe that we were building some Star Wars outer space war machine when it was all fallacy\nHe played them here that goes you played them like a federal made them spend money they didn't have run 'em right in the bankruptcy and Trump is playing these folks\nLike tobacco ... like a federal and and and I love the beauty of it and uh and and that's what he's doing\nMean I I was refreshing to hear your comments because\nI truly sit back in ... I I Am genuinely concerned and I'd be I'd be willing why anyone would say let's put the Democrats in charge and tried to impeach cabin on beach Trump stall everything when everything seems to be going in the right in the right direction when everything economically speaking\n... in every way unemployment is down he can ... the GDP Growth is up\nOr were renegotiating these deals are I don't see a bad sign out there at all I mean not a bad sign for America the economy and who knows what's next why would I Want to get bogged down\nIn this stuff that bothers me a lot as to how we could do derail a train\nAnd let me tell you something no one's talking about an hour and that's probably the most important thing out there no one talks about are kinda anymore no one talks about ISIS anymore no one no one is is is scared that the next time they were on an airplane\nIt might get blown out of the sky because they're they're they're strong and powerful and it scares of Jesus how these folks those Middle East crazies are scared of Trump they're scared because he they know or they think that he will\nPush the button and blow them to smithereens or blow Moscow\nAnd I think that's how you lead you leave with power I think you read would fear gets people they're gonna they're they're trying to kill everything we stand for\nAnd no one's giving him credit for that either and I and and that's fundamentally\nRight connected to the economy you know the the market was going down and two thousand one before nine eleven but when nine eleven hit that was that was the actual that was the nail on the coffin for the economy that was going to nail on the coffee program stock market\nThat was the nine eleven that caused the market crashed granted it was just nine eleven he finished it off\nAnd if you get a terrorist attack that will definitely induce fear in the market and will it will cause panic\nAnd panic selling and that guy the way he's doing things by ... you know making them afraid of vox for a change and and putting our line in the sand saying you're not going to you're not going to hurt one more American Life or we're going to destroy you I Love that and I'm for that\nRight I mean there were about\nI don't know what they expect even like today\nThey announced to this and what the Saudi Arabia or whatever announced that they did they might not might if that they killed this guy who went to their compound or whatever in an interrogation that went bad so look how little time it took to get them to admit\nThat they did this and now they're making an excuse in interrogation that went bad\nAnd Trump has said listen we're still going to sell them their weapons because they don't buy from us so by from Russia and we don't want to lose those jobs but there's gotta be consequences but they pony up to the table pretty quick cure I miss event\n...

York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations what do you think is going to happen\nWhen those types of things are set\nAnd I'm not look at the end of the day people responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this was going to look back here in France\nAll's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her and secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about

and that's a natural cyclical process for the past two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal skillful and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking\nHigh
