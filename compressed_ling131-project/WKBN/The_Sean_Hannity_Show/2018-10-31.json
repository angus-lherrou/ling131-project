great job as governor of Florida\nAnd I love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is that a tight race let's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that Senate legal gift ended up itself Andrew never reporter that\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time\nThey've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York junk get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so it'll be interesting to report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark\nAnd er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum picked this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal\nApartheid state and so that's one of Andrew strongest supporters\nAndrew to this day opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats in may a Gillum blamed Israel you know they just use those attacks as a free tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is it a relief ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be the funded they pay they say the U.S is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical it'd make Nicolas Maduro flush so key sign their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's please them proud to a snake food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement there in the free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know what I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making because I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point you know\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized health care\nHe his the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so we're really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridians that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way\nThey'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he

Americans lost their doctors lost their plans and everybody paid more in spite of belied the big promise of Obamacare what is fascinating as we now head into the\nFinal week of this midterm election campaign is what Democrats won't talk about now we had earlier in the program really had project baritone dot com and James O'Keefe on and he's not been able to exposed\nIn Tennessee bill Brett is and the Democrat Claire McCaskill the Democrat in Missouri Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat in North Dakota Christian cinema the Democrat in Arizona that none of these people are\nBeing honest with the people in their respective states they don't want a border wall they want sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nAnd in California they want to take it a step further free health care for anybody resident non resident legal illegal doesn't matter Gavin Newsom women's out in California\nOn top of your Thirteen and a half percent state income tax\nNow Californians are going to put up a sign welcome to California the home of free health care and I got to tell you what's gonna happen people are going to go to California just to get free health care great job Gavin Newsom watch this implode on Californians it's got to be ugly and the mass exodus out of California will even continue\nAt a greater clip and a greater pace you know so now what's happened is somehow we forgot that what eight years of Obamacare Americans slowly beginning to forget that their premiums are have gone up three four hundred percent in some cases\nForgetting that they only have one choice of a health care provider forgetting that they lost their doctor from long ago that they really liked and wanted\nAnd they forget that people with a pre existing conditions well with Obamacare you pay more higher premiums than any other plant rate hikes that nobody ever expected and they lied to you about\nPeople losing their doctors that was a lie you like it Dr keep your doctor people losing their plans with no choice anymore and this has now become and the final week of the election this is their talking points all across the country they're saying well where we're going to where we support health care of preexisting\nConditions while the Republicans repeal replace planned supported preexisting conditions\nAnd they're trying to basically go with the narrow\nLie that Republicans want you to die Republicans want dirty or water dirty air they want to kill children they want to throw granny over the cliff of course they're racist or sexist massaging as they can Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic\nOh and by the way Donald Trump's responsible for the horrible shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue he's hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American at that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress and the Senate as we move forward and\nThere are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of new innovative\nMedicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone he gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states with smart governors or it can be a lot different and a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health
