joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances what China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them but\nThey're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show ... and bite me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe well let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these

twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me it's the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she what she means it has come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president at the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nI'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock\nWhy that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call these officers racist from front to back\nMe I call them heroes men and women\nMy campaign isn't about party about getting the job done messages on the high prove this message\nThat is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the directory of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career\nHer political career for personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThey and tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics of the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts land solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points of like the guys like Bill weld than\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that\nCare about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nSo the people still paying taxes like you and I were on the burden has gone up in up in up because they're trying to offset diminished tax base\nSo I I Do think it's scary and and look the other thing I said it's one thing if you pay taxes when you get something in return okay you've got great roads great healthcare grade schooling you pay the taxes well that's a fair deal\nIt's another thing if you're paying the taxes for all these different good and you're not getting in return I go back to this this familiar refrain in the ... valley we pay some of the highest tax rates in the state of Ohio in the ... valley yet in terms of what we get we have terrible infrastructure or schools or or or a week and\nWe're just not getting the bang for buck for our taxes so I yeah I hear you out I'm with you\nWe're talking with Danny Davis economic guru just talking about the economy in general are you concerned as the deficit and debt of the country continue to go up\nYou know I I'm not you concern in the short term I I think the markets recognize that are\nOn the economy's doing well deficits and that will take care of themselves again it goes back to what I said before we have a great period with a strong economy or the markets aren't really concerned about a lot of these issues and they gave me this time effects are structural problems\nI think it becomes an issue three four five six years down the line if no action is taken on the debt and the deficit and one more point I think it's important to make\nFederal tax revenues are up this year relatives last year the reason why we have such a bad deficit is because we have a spending problem spending has skyrocketed discretionary spending went up military spending went up\nUm entitlement spending went up all these different outlays sky rocketed because the economy's doing well\nThat's what caused the deficit to split it's not like the government's taking in less money they're taking in more money because the economy's growing there's more economic activity but it's the spending that's gone out of control\nIn the short term I think we're okay I don't think it's a big worry in the long term the longer it goes on like is the worst problem gets if that makes sense tomorrow we should be fine ten months from now should be fine it's ten years from now that we have to worry\nAbout President Trump made fun of him when he was running said he needs to get the economy at four or five percent GDP because that solves a lot of problems with Social Security Medicare and the debt deficits a and he was made fun of by Obama and others saying well that's a pipe dream\nAnd we're in for point three percent GDP or if we continue on this even though we cut corporate taxes and lower taxes it's generating more money you can if we control spending solve a lot of our problems like he was saying correct\nYeah I think the big issue is we we got the economy movie got time to fix the trucks all possible slits structural problems that will be back\nThe news you want to know kill and turkey moral deserves the news a little way wave you need to know Stormy Daniels horse race day in the\nHeat on border

you'll enjoy it's delicious\nOrange and we've been talking with Jane Davis or economic guru about so the state of the economy which is always in change are in flux going in the right direction these days you made a comment once we conclude our interview with which I thought is really defines things\nWe have gone from a marketplace to one nation in other words Trump doesn't view us as a marketplace the views this as a nation and I think that's why the things are changing as far as the deals that are negotiated and why the economy is probably heading in the right direction and why America seems to be on the right track again\nWould you agree\nI Would agree I I Would say this\nThe marketing exist to serve the nation and the wellbeing of the nation\nThat nation does not exist to serve the market America is not a market it's a country it's a culture of people it's a place it's a history a it's a republic and it's not just a marketplace so uh I Would absolutely agree we need to put the people first\nYou know I Believe in markets I think capitalism is a good thing but we we're pretty sure he'll\nWe could point during Davis thank you\n[noise] seven o clock and shot by American source for fine art Baron rather some news\nRadio five seven\nI'm dairy all their President Trump putting it pretty plainly the Saudi Government and murdered a missing journalist the U.S will respond

of those drugs it's six dollars a treatment\nGood luck getting those prices anywhere we couldn't institutionalized this\nAnyway so there's ... they're not running on what they believe we've learned that with Brett us in in Tennessee\nIt's the project Vera toss we've learned it with Claire McCaskill caught on undercover videos she's white there's outrageous we needed investigation investigation into what\nThe fact that you and your own words are saying to the people in Missouri I'm a liar I Am a fake phony fraud I Am a I'm just a phony\nI'm a liar I'm saying whatever I Need to say to get elected I don't mean any of it my job is to bamboozled the people of Missouri lie to them then go to Washington and I'm going to govern just like Iraq Obama\nThey can't win if they define who they really are\nThey can't win if they give us their true agenda they can't win if they say yeah we really want to impeach Trump impeach forty five and Pete forty five and teach forty five are claiming my timer claiming my time they tell Maxine Waters don't say it was ... I don't want to talk about\nIt just don't say if they tell her and she says they told me not to say it but I'm going to keep saying in any way\nSo their gender is impeachment endless never ending investigations open borders eliminate ice sanctuary cities now we have a sanctuary state California\nThey want ... why do they want to open borders to they've calculated that is going to benefit them at the ballot box helping them retain power notice every decision and every agenda item is about them wanting to hold onto power period\nIt doesn't matter the output uh the the what the end result is doesn't matter Obama wrecked the economy I won't give you the statistics again if you listen to this program regularly I Know you can recite them by rote as well\nThe only reason I say it so often is that so everybody nobody can't say they didn't know\nBut that's what they want to take us back to that but they want their crumbs back they want they want to destroy Trump they're driven\nBy a borderline like tonic hatred of this president\nThey want to go back to what back to Obamacare they weren't open borders so that they think that their their party will remain in power for ever if they get enough people crossing the border caravans of people\nAre going to talk about what the president's planning and ... that's what they stand for\nThis is what the Democratic Party take back the crumbs he pulled by Medicare open borders impeach Trump endless investigation what name one thing they're that they're doing to make your life better\nBut goes after losing Thirteen million Americans and and having them have to go through food stamps to survive and sustain themselves in eight years of a failed do Tommy of Obama the only president never to reach three percent GDP Growth in American history\nYou know they want to what we don't want to add more people why 'cause they're dependent on them\nThe crumbs they're handing out the irony of that they're ... what what did the leftovers they have\nKnow when they're done building their gyms their Senate gyms or house Kim's there you know house barber shops there Senate barber shops the Senate dining rooms their house dining rooms or they treat themselves well they're not they're not on Obamacare they got a separate how system just for them very different\n[noise] so that's what's at stake you're not going to tell you something about this border as I watch this caravan\nYou've got to understand this is a about national security this is personal security\nI think I'm the only person in the media that actually took the time over the years and I've been down reporting from the border Thirteen times site antidote you've told us that before\nYeah I've been on horseback yeah Ben and helicopters yeah been out on boats yeah I've been on foot Yemen all terrain vehicles I've been on the border all the way from the Rio Grande straight on through San Diego in many stops in between\nI've seen gang members arrested drug warehouse the biggest warehouse I've ever seen in my life floor to ceiling drugs confiscated cast where they were headed\nTo Yorktown your city to your kids that they ingest them and now it's worse than ever\nBut there's now a lot of the heroin that we have we have an opioid crisis in this country is is one the one issue is oh kids go into grandma grandpa was medicine cabinet they try a bike and then a Percocet anoxic ... and\nThey go back they got another one next thing you know they're addicted next thing you know they're buying them on the streets God Knows what those pills really aren't the drug dealers don't give a rip it these kids die\nThen when they find out they can't afford eighty bucks the pill well then some genius idiot friend or dealer friend quote of theirs so why don't you try heroin does much better high and the only ten dollars a bag\nAnd they'll start snorting heroin or chasing the dragon as they call it and they light up in smoke it and then eventually you're going to remain lining it and then guess what they're on a trajectory straight into the grave\nAnd a life of a living hell\nAnd that's the opioid crisis and wears a lot of those drugs coming from right over the border where it's human trafficking happening right over the border what's happening all across the border there's a new thing it's called ... and all\nYou don't talk to my buddy Eric Bowley his Nineteen year old son ... bought an than that which is you know to relieve anxiety\nAnd and and it was laced if you have three grains of fat and all the size of three grain of salt it will kill you\nAnd we have nearly a hundred thousand kids dying every single day one death every seven point five minutes you know almost a hundred thousand deaths a year and we keep talking about opioid crisis left and right opioid we can stop it if we secure the border\nCaravans now so I think it's right I think Kavanaugh what do we see what's happening all\nThe total total elimination of anything that we recognize as the U.S constitution the rule of law equal justice under the law equal application of our laws or the presumption of innocence what presumption of innocence I Believe her never heard from a bribe believer\nYou know that no corroborating evidence I don't believe her\nYou know but then ... no no no but but they were lined up almost on a weekend basis they wind up in the hall first they spike the punch bowl and after they fight the punch bowl the boys would wind up in the hall every weekend and then they rape the girls in the room they take turns and it happened almost every weekend\nAnd then the story evolved into well I didn't see him spike the punch bowl but I saw a mirror punch bowl\nAnd I see I saw him give out a red solo cup\nThat's what that became\nSo and then Dianne Feinstein wants to bring that up again\nAfter eight FBI investigations what are they offering for you because since Trump spent president you got four million new jobs since Trump's been president four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs jobs that Obama said would never coming back\nSince he's been president we've gotten rid of more regulations than the last five presidents\nA combined\nUh he's opened up the entire energy industry of which we have a flawed\nLiterally of natural resources those are going to be career paying jobs high paying jobs for so many millions of
