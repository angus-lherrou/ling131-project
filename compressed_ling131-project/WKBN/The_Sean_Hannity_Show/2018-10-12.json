it based on the pony dusty a in every case a broad committed upon the size of courts and then the same information that we now have learned the media leaked strategy that existed\nJust before it leaves a page said nobody at any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter Struck said that there is no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was they had immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had when\nIn fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt or whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty I used to manipulate not only by the court judges and commit abroad on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lies in the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like\nThis guy and then it got used again and again and again they weaponize what turned out to be nothing but at the bones set of documents that its own author won't stand by\nAnyway why won't Rod Rosenstein now appear under oath before the committees with Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte where's the subpoena demanding that he turned over the the three oh to lose the pies wars all these things that have been requested\nJim Jordan who's joining us Freedom Caucus member candidate to be speaker of the house of representatives if the Republicans winning twenty six days and congressman Dave Brat of Virginia and by the way congressman Dave Brat who happens to be in one of those districts that is a very very tough but winnable district\nIf you're in what district to you in ... in the commonwealth her\nSeventh seventh district Sean\nThat much if you're in the seventh district in the commonwealth the Virginia let me tell you something we need Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus within that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made\nYou know for the last seven years and he's been fighting hard every day and he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him defeated\nIf you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you can and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is it is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona how many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is Senate confirmed when he goes to his confirmation process he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has questioned link called is this or that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ...\nA account of someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it ... you're supposed to come in at ... or ... or maybe he's the guy who runs the Justice Department and understand the timeline on may ninth\nKobe is fire based on the Rosenstein them all on basic hate this when he has this conversation with Lisa Page and Andy McCabe where he says he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn may sixteen and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel also selling what what else happened on ...\nThat's the day more than ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and they will get signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we want is all you want to bring you didn't ask me questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this uh what first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going to go where it went on the pilot the or the health care immigration pact or my opponent is a color your liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and never come off big time and I'm a junior right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle\nAnd that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... captain and Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left I think the ah the voters in Virginia or darker to write that\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there are\nListening to people want the full list the we've identified the tops Seventy deeds we put it up on the Hannity dot com\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who was in a tough race\nThey get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply to capture Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out him harass anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary near ISIS\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nThe list is phenomenal did this get additional but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going for points to present lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way in twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do this thing can make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together that they have no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understands that he's out campaigning on the good things that have happened with conservative leadership and his leadership or that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all men on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves the Russia investigation as as the caller is sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing\nWhat do you mean by that uh they brought\nYou know I'll just go back to the way your frame that you only got ... dot com it's all like ... Iran over its I get the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people because we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and\nNow he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and he when he just sat in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and all that Jim go on with the so\nYeah it's not so ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his\nHis conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should have disqualified him Rosenstein is right about that but in the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo for why companies should be fired one of the things mowers looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me\nYou've gotta be kidding me so that guy's gonna oversee this so both of them had conflicts and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you're both right neither one of you should be involved in the special counsel any type of oversight\nOr I don't want to thank you both for being with us a congressman\nJust kind of iPhones and you can make them the ... my hair\nSticking exclusively tonight on Hannity on Fox News channel is James O'Keefe\nWell the opponent of Marsha Blackburn the former governor of Tennessee\nI'm well he actually went undercover and where do you hear what is said and by the way this is one of what's going to be a series of tapes\nThat will lick suppose all of these red state Democrats they say one thing when they're running for office but they have very different plans after and later and we're going to get to all of that or let's say a re just in Ohio Toledo what's going on Regis how are you\nI'm Shaun how are you I'm good what's happening\nAt Jim Jordan and Dave Brat on there and you've had a a a Trey Gowdy I think previously over the past time but the thing that irritates me about when you talk to these guys and this Rod Rosenstein a fiasco that's going on [noise]\nYou'd never ask them why don't they just somebody stand up and make this guy up here and how does he keep his job when he won't come and you know go before Congress like he's being instructed to\nWell I mean that's a great that's a great point because you and I wouldn't be able to ... you know we you and I wouldn't be able to if they subpoenaed are documents good luck to us\nJust like in the case that Hillary Clinton ... have you ever subpoenaed you know your emails and your belief thirty three thousand of 'em and then you bleach bit your hard drive and have someone bus stop your devices and take out sim cards guess what's going to happen to read just take a guess\nYeah yeah I Know you're going to jail in\nJordan I liked Dave Brat I like all these guys but after a while you just find out they're they're they're all talking no actually\nThat's not true I mean do you think of everything that we've gotten we've been able to peel the onion to the point where we've exposed at all of this happened they listed in every document we have gotten is because we had to pull teeth to get everything I mean we we are getting their hope you see that\nYou've given it to him on a platter but they will act on it for\nWell it's not Jordan and it's not brat and it's not meadows but it is some of the leadership and the Republican Party that are weak and timid and learn nothing of the success of Donald Trump that I can say that I can agree with you on\nAll right we'll take a quick break

I was watching it on the Fox news channel has an ad out there\nIt is now the number one best selling history ... series in history and this tells a powerful story and one that I think we really need to always be aware of and that is that evil does exist\nI've talked about this for years it's very hard for good people or genuinely good people people trying to be good people to understand their wrap their arms around the fact that how is it possible that you know communism fascism in in this case that he was writing about ...\nIn the last century a hundred million humans souls destroyed\nNow

that's why we got involved with this sister Patricia and I are good friends with and other things with her and uh she uh you know we did that call fighting yep every year it's been a twenty five year old ... event that we've answered for being able to do does\nBut the need keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and we had the opportunity\nTo bring this talent out to a dinner concert a cash bar and\nI Can't think of a better way to raise money for the attitude ... than than somebody that come out and enjoy the concert and a good a good meal\nFolks I Can't do it you know as as he's talking here I Would just tell you the thoughts of going through online this is why\nThey run an operation that knows how to treat people fair in decently and with no shenanigans\nBecause deep down it's how you treat ... it's how you treat these other organizations this is your I I Know I've been a sound like this is your core being is what I'm saying\nAnd the and you are smart enough you and your wife race Patrick to be the same way or path to be the same way and Patrick to be the same way I mean it's a it's almost like instilled in you\nYou're right it's it's the upbringing you know I've been married six years when we got married there was no such there were no options you got married you statement\nBut I married the love of your life this is why I Love this guy that's my attitude too I mean that is my ah you know this is a commitment to the games exactly\nYou know so I find myself agreeing with you on that kind of stuff and I know you're shaking your head yeah and then I say well look Lucy runs the show over there and my wife friends [laughter] so I can I can tell I can totally relate to that kind of stuff\nThis is talk a little bit about that one shift back to the windows is a ... do you guys install year round I mean if if you if if you're saying okay it's October twelfth or whatever if you get moving on this because a lot of times you start thinking about it with colder weather or something like that\nOr do you guys say okay we can get it we can get it done\nBeing the professional company we are we work twelve months out of the year now if it's really really bad uh snow like crazy howling and you know it's miserable\nYou don't want that going into the house you know exactly\nBut we opened up an opening it normally in a bedroom it's only going to be open for ten minutes though you close the door and you go and do you do your work and you you're done and you've got it finished um\nWhen you have professional people like we have our installers but was for years they are professional installer\nAnd that makes a huge difference in my I mean as good as a window is Fred as good as the product is the\nFirst one is putting that window in and their dedication makes a huge difference\nIt it does ... you could take the best product on the market and give it to a handy man and you may have issues down the road but you can take a less expensive product give it to qualify craftsman at least is going to look good right might not hold up as you look good\nWe use both we've got the best product on the market most of our windows are made right if you're over here in Akron am I also I had been around since Nineteen forty seven\nAnd there are there do the double glass or you know ... double glass that you want the gas in there and you want the stuff that keeps you visa outright there's a lot we lower Mississippi film I mean if you if you made recommendations you got to have all of that and I\nAbsolutely that there's where you save money but it but if you have all those features and you've got the quality of the product you got the quality of the contractor you don't need anything else isn't that got us\nRight now and then you guys stand behind these things so that is so that if it breaks I mean talk a little bit about a lot of the standing behind it because you know standing behind it is only as good as the company\nAnd I normally as big as the company correct um window worlds has had since day one and a warranty that says ah we're gonna covered that window for the life of the window ... class breakage a shield failure or\nWhatever could happen mechanical you know you get a case ... with some mechanics if that goes bad you know we're asked us to fix it right absolutely that's that's part of our deal people love the fact that they won't have to do anything to that window again right and wrong with it we were back\nThen you know what a company stands behind something like that they know it's a quality product would you not agree from the very beginning serious absolutely\nAnd and the warranty is exceptionally well written it's not written on the back of a napkin like some far\n[laughter] All right at the bottom line is is\nI I mean the bottom line you want to save energy on your gas bills you want to you you want a company a local company and with nationwide buying power nationwide reputation saving on your gas bills with quality installers it you'll feel comfortable with on your property in in in in in your home do you want that\nAnd do you want to be treated with respect and dignity and no shenanigans\nWell any you know do you want to stand out a window or put it on the ground if you want to do that too right I mean seriously will do whatever you want\nWell you'd mentioned the glass one of the reasons why we can stand on went to all of our classes double strength most of our competitors ... NGO string\nAnd you're kind of skinny too All right it's a window world how do we get a hold of ya eight oh seven a southern\nRight there in ... there you go thank you Fred Ron my friend Moran window world and we appreciate and being with US News is coming up next stay tuned [noise]\n\nFrom ABC News on the wrist in American detainee right now is fried after two years in a Turkish prison pastor\nAndrew Brunson was held on terror charges today he appeared and a Turkish court he was convicted with time served\nPresident Trump in Cincinnati saying he's grateful Turkish courts finally released the American pastor Andrew Brunson\nAnybody the issue of incivility is now back in the forefront even more I mean it shouldn't surprise anybody um and by the way what is really happening\nWhat a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away and the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign and his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency but the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view\nLater in the program today but I mean it is it is mind numbing\nThat people have the hero truth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them off oh why do we get to the tape on cinema today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but then when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's our first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want\nThe crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama which put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty\nAnd he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back well in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers ear and\nWell they tell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country it was saying and I'm like why\nDo we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ... marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties is like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnyway spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the hours free Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance\nAnd you know that would that maybe a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about saving neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred\nThree or four hundred Bernie ... was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows in the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary I our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America you know they shouldn't be about conservative\nLiberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that it's downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vile thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat phone turns out to train tiny west in the race on draft now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention more like the printed as he's all of a sudden now that the the modeled spokes person he's he's the token negro of as of the Trump administration's this\nWas an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her brain\nI think you had there man has clearly not okay to president who's willing to boy that\nWas a combination of famous consciousness I felt like I sit in on a psychiatric center\nAnd a commercial for Donald Trump on the question of of of mental health on the question of other cleaning ham I felt sorry for them to me that was something very fragile valid and sad about tiny pulling out of town and France played Taipei in his country outside I think for their own and some have somewhere picture of a ... I mean\nJust to expand on that it seems like an important point I haven't\nHeard anyone else on television make at that but I think we're all\nA thoughtful play by play and political on out here not things that was her fault on our White House\nI'm just going to be honest I may get a lot of trouble for it I feel actually for bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself\n[laughter] this is white supremacy by brain trauma course I'm a black mouth is moving but white racist ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiles\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most of the various practices and yet how black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of anti black sentiments that have been ... by people with far more rigorous credentials\nIt is so vicious and vile I don't even know where to begin\nHow was that acceptable to anybody this I don't know Kanye except I talk to him twice in my life\nAnd we talked about safer cities like the city of Chicago we talked about economic empowerment and opportunity for people for everybody in this country he's a billionaire\nAnd he is a pack on that vicious horrible level\nI don't even know what to say my friend Heisman\nTrophy winning football great Herschel Walker he's called out CNN's Don Lemon for allowing all all of those insults to go out against Kanye West and the questions is on their behavior and as a cast of a referring to them is quote the oh leave all want to repeat what you just heard\nMm [noise] Mm [noise] [noise] [noise]\nRight as we roll on Sean Hannity's show eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program so much happening you know I just wonder I think there's something we can factor in here there's actually two things that I that are just known\nWhat the president or the president is going to be in Ohio tonight president spend now traveling the country you know I'd love the fact that you know probably political people around the president of\nTelling him well you may not want to get involved in is the Republicans lose they're going to blame you blah blah blah [noise]\nThat that's just not how he rolls if you if we if you fight hard and you give something you're all and you don't win at least you can look in the mirror and say you did everything you could do\nBut there's there's a lot at stake that's not going to\nBe the end of the world of the Democrats were just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress\nI that that's really the truth and it's important that we keep the momentum are you better off than you or two years ago are you a safer more secure is the economy better off on every measure we know the answer to it\nBut watching Democrats unhinged is pretty amazing right we've got tapes on yes read as soon as running in ah
