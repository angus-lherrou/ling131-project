I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats if Locy become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change\n[noise] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes they're legal this stuff and he'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters we\nGet calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said it's getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time could jak thing\nThey are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same\nRange I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he's right to say that the Democrats are mobilized can focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump that is a risk the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what other forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races in negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that ... top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical ... sets of Republicans really need to win and and dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I

so it is and although he's being outspent I'm sure I look I'm being outspent by six or seven to one\nAnd I mean Bloomberg shifting in another four million dollars and the last review the campaign all

days away\nHi Shaun yeah I Can't wait to get out there and vote and I've got several people lived in my mind in keeping pat ... we have to get out there this is such a a referendum against the socialists and I've got to say and live with the events the\nYou know these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess a spacious devices because we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe going to make sure that that's been confirmed 'cause they when they said they had powder I'm assuming that was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of charging a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him well\nIt's a different tact than you hear from the media today right\nRight and you know what some may and thank you for correcting me about the update on me I'm that bomb threats what I'm concerned about as\n... as he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the sticky jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between now is that the vigils could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the ... family was threatened as well\nAs it and I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of ... I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career and frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having a strong political views it's on it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I think\nWhat we should be able to tell her you should be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and apparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together uh people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this

run\nGet blown up and Lucy already back to the fifty yard line\nMa league Richmond defense and then ...\n... as you get a three and out as quickly coming on private Travis a writer and we should come out of it again with good bill position\nYeah my leg Richmond was back after the fact of the running play back what Ryan boil as quickly as boy was back there nice athletic play by my colleague\nRichmond a nice big sec fourth and tent or\nThe ... year half the part why as you should uh you know be catching this if we can around the fifth day with a little run back we should have great bill position\nReiner gets it off ... back in his own forty eight yard line costs catch natural begin this Dr let's get on to Mike is why as you get the ball back with a seventh\nReally guys like you said interesting like going up or down and what I've seen from oil in Indiana to quarterback pretty much all games are far is doing a great job going through the Russians and that has not been the case or in that last dried eagles see why is you can get it back on that the oil and an excellent job looking up people go into a second and third reading ...\nMike any any discussion that you saw ... after why as you had that last lot fence of series are what are the coaches saying to them regarding walking schemes what's happening for them not to be a successful as they want to be here the last couple of series\nI mean I I think it's you know what you said it's just kind of sticking with a new one and not get into some times I think with Indian is they don't often that third downplay call was a little bit questionable especially when they've had some good yard don't short pass was\nFor why issue though I think it's just sticking with the do you have heard some fans down here screaming throw the football but I I can tell you go to Chris who's going to want to be a run for his team but he's mostly in the game like this\nAlso cash middle in there for the game portray Bryant after linebacker position\n[noise] yeah so Brian did go out and looked like it it definitely for today unlikely to come back so cash\nBut showing their linebacker so good started physician why she will begin at their own forty eight yard lines word on the first possession they had the football\nWhen Ninety seven yards and right now we said of the seven three score\nQuite interesting Bob

behind us and the tennis center it's going to have some greatly needed parking between us and walks especially with the new a media center going off and then much needed\nIntramural field going between us and Herschel in there every time you come up here something new was happening and why issue I mean it it's hitting on all cylinders proud to be on our ballot\nAll start first down antenna to our own forty seven yard line so we see Kendrick Mallory coming now wide receiver also a mild joining a tight end for why issue in the gang number ... good receiver as well join her will take the football we are going to throw quickly and stuff like that it's a line of scrimmage\nAt a receiver open but a big de Lima got us Bob Stephen Mayes able to not get away and complete it'll be a second down and then\nSeven three are score paint ones in front of you to capitalize on this bill position second time we've started nearby field\nTen fifty nine to go to a half time we'll talk with President Trump's or half time but\nWe might talk with him even before that Bob I bought that that right he's pretty busy and the president\nSlow down and join us I Can't believe it was\nThe second down in ten that just to look for quarterback single running back wanna throw again looking less gunning left on time Roswell down to the forty and Jeremiah Wright's attack oh inside the thirty\nFive to thirty were yard line after twenty yard gator young downstate moves the Jains first down penguins beautiful and\nWe we do have residents wrestle kind of on June with all the unbelievable stuff happening here who can wear a lot of friends and people in the box and\nHe wants to touch down here we want to touch down there and then we're going to tell you that he's going to have your ability\nAs an analyst here comes up the middle and the castor good yard is right up the gun in the deep end the none of the twenty six yard line so give them a castor about seven will set up something that we're going but please don't get down and\nThree yeah and once again Bob it's the same template we had an that's boring Dr good running good passing ...\nBack to ... get down to the yard\nLines of tapping the castor looks like he's well on his way to another hundred yards rushing day burnt down when the red zone\nAnd you're just like this is a ... on all the wrong place you don't see any of our running backs get hit or so about three yards down the field and that sets up anything you want to do in your office here first down almost in the red zone here penguins in the lead seventh during the\nDay and get here come landlord or he's going to give them a cast during the Castro is going to be hit by the linebacker Jonas ... outside linebacker from Louisville but not until he gets about four yards on the run another at any time you get for better on first down that yourself up pretty good shape\nYeah that's a you know the key to the go to our friends and I don't care who you are as you got to get you can't get a first down before a third down you can't be I'm thirty five or be on some of your plate book goes away so you can get it the third one or two that the last quarter back\nDr and border and he tries to get to the corner and then what good play made up run that is a wreck supposedly you do see a lot of defensive tackle where number three but he does stand out because he's a two hundred Ninety powder that'll keep a to a third down in about five you did a good job not alone in order to get outside\nAnd they show good teams speed every time an order strides are the stakes are run and get to the outside you've seen those linebackers closed pretty quickly and I found that third downplay when they caught\nIn order to shore goals or why not five white Christian Turner lined up as a white out and Ryan image of the game as well you know running backs then order back there alone on third down in nearly seven three looking for more\nTo rush story guns over the middle one\nTown in a way looking for browse well but the quarterback breaks on the football and that was run don't green is a senior from Bowling Green Kentucky and that means we'll get

Indiana\nSo Indiana State will have the football but it's going to be the big run\nGoing to be the gated by a penalty against Indiana State or anything so they will start anywhere near as good a bill position but as we look at the replay a very close to where there's a lot of like his\nLast one was out of bounds right coach Christ is look at it looked like his left foot was out of bounds hope hopefully they're going to take a look at this replay Bob I think it could be overturned\nIt just we only have four or five camera angles it's hard to see but right as very valid conference does have replay and from the ed view here I think there's a fifty percent chance that but we got our first out\nSome of the ... the rolling on the field is a far right there yeah so that left it'll have to be clearly a scene by the replay official to overturn it let's go to Mike just ask you Mike what are you at\nAs honest way from what I had and what I've seen on the replay it looked like he was close to going out of bounds but at the top thing like you said it was only the four or five cameras you can't really get a good angle one that football came out so right now on the field they're saying it is a fumble\nI I wouldn't be surprised if it's dance because it has to be a ... day over Clooney and you just can really find a good angle where to see where that football came out and kind of tear it up when his blood touched that about\nYou know the one thing you're not going to have it we go out to be confirmed\nNormal than\nThe crowds go crazy right\nBecause they're probably less than us close it was very close this is my foot is left for work if it was normal replay looked like it I have a chance of being out of what we do have the they would've caught 'em out about that probably would have been a fan of that show up\nYeah just camp out his arms out of bounds I don't know why they didn't look at that ain't going I mean that's crazy that's much better showing it on a train to the fans are gone crazy they're showing it right there he has the ball and that's what is out of bounds\nIndiana State will get the ball after the penalty against them it's a first down from their own forty a yard line [noise]\nAnd we've got ten test high school bands and they had a little rehearsal pre game over at the watch and they were marching through the tailgate lots trying to Rob people up and I know they're thrilled to have a happy time performance here you know with the marching pride and so it's just good to get kids on campus and\nYou know I have um good wholesome fun and adding to the crowd color if you will anytime you can add\nA little something to a ball game it's a real plus in with the hall of fame\nI don't know the football players as well because they're mostly from the coaching Koch era I Do remember James Terry a little bit because we played against him couldn't block them when I was at Ohio State he was pretty darn good but it's fun to see the impact it has on those former student athletes years after they were here you know to be recognized back\nIt kind of elicits memories forum and\nWhat I like is when they all come back and they say wow this campus has changed a lot and adds to their Youngstown State pride and that's a fun thing and you know let's face it in Missouri Valley football right in the heat that all someone asked me the other day about the play offs and I said well you know we never liked to talk about the play offs and we'd like to talk about each game\nBut the reality is when you get on a roll\nI'm not sure back in sixteen\nIf early on you know we were thinking that much about the play offs but all of a sudden we got role and then I don't know if we won six in a row southern role made in a row so you never know what will happen\nYou know I think about Indiana State of we're playing today and my first year calling the games was eighty nine we want a big game out there I Believe they miss they feel go late we needed that when we go on a beat eastern Kentucky you remember that game at all that eighty nine game because I remember but it was my first game calling games for the penguins\nYou know I don't remember that particular game I remember every time we went out there was a battle it wasn't always the biggest crowd was always a long bus trip and I know we had some battles that was probably Dennis rates was the coach\nAnd they had been in the playoffs in the mid eighties and so they were always a tough team won I remember more is the eighty eight game where it was pouring rain here and we had decided to take the red shirt off of re Isaac and he'd been red shirted for like the first step and games of the year and\nNow we were to win six I think pouring rain there weren't many people here we were struggling after having a good year in eighty seven thought we were getting better but we just weren't getting great quarterback place so we thought\nMaybe it's time and so Wray went in and played a little bit about half the game and we came up with a big win Leo Hawkins had a couple of big runs that day but I don't remember eighty nine as much sometimes you forget those type wins\nRe mentioned coaches and so forth courting Mallory the head coach at Indiana State did you coach against his dad do Mallory when he was an Indiana at all\nI have a good question I don't think so I think camp Cameron was the coach and then trying to think of further down the line was Kevin Wilson\nIt might've been well somebody's going to be ... or Nader\nAh yeah I might have been Kevin but just two weeks ago I happened to be in Oxford, Ohio they were honoring the Nineteen Seventy three team of Miami of Ohio which bill Mallory was the coach\nAnd his widow Eli Mallory was that the game so I got a chance to talk to her a little bit and talk about her son and what a good job he's doing it Indiana State but I don't know that I ever I I Can't remember ever coaching against bill Mallory\nBoyle let you go you mentioned John Hancock earlier in the interview John's is doing a great job is the coordinator at Iowa State of course coached Antonio terrific job Michigan State and you've got assistant coaches you work with all over the country now that you're in a different role the coaching did stay in touch with these guys\nYou know I really do and and that's really the games I look to on Sunday Morning or on Saturday Night when the scores are rolling in fact\nI had a tough weekend to be honest with you because ... for the first time at Cincinnati and PJ flak lost out at Nebraska the head coach of Minnesota and of course the buckeyes lost in Michigan State laws to Michigan thank goodness for the penguins\nMy brownies lost an overtime so the only ah winter I had last weekend was the penguins do if I can only

games where and you're a coach or a high school football coach you know this uh the kids don't have the kids don't show up to play and and uh they're not showing much enthusiasm and they wind up losing to a team that they probably shouldn't have lost two today\nWell you know what I think in ... you you bring up some great\nPoints today about\nThis game as about passion and playing hard I shot a game today you know what a coach Panini in that staff there not coaching guys number one or allowing guy go to or not I guess they're demanding guys to play hard but you know what\nWhen it came as exactly what you get into my passion upbeat going up playing hard there has to be a demand being from Youngstown and an alumni of Youngstown State that it's not done great coaches 'cause I have a lot of respect production cement that better coaches he adds on as having a country but\nWhat if guys aren't going to play football a certain way you're not going to win and maybe it was a little too cold out today for some guy from Florida where or some other places like that you know like uh I I don't understand I don't understand or maybe a little too\nChilly out here today I don't buy the cultures right the coach damn right about being upset about it and he'll pick things fix things\nOh you absolutely will fix things but it's embarrassing to sit back and and well it's not just today it's the entire season I've noticed this and I'm I'm Glad coach ... brought this up because\nYou know when you see a team come out of the tunnel and I know I've done a two way too many high school football games in my lifetime broadcast way too many games and I've seen way too many college football games in my lifetime\nNinety nine times out of a hundred when I see a team coming out of the tunnel\nAnd they're showing some excitement and they're jumping on each other or they're slapping each other with the the shoulder pads or just jumping up and down getting all fired up I Know that that seems ready to go but when I see him coming out of the tunnel and their jogging toward the\nBench and then that's it and they're not showing any emotion whatsoever I got a question whether that team has been a part to play this game I honestly do\nEngine tough thing you know when something like that happened because I've been a part of a situation where you're very disappointed at the end of the game but like you're saying you know what I don't understand when kids I just don't understand it I'm not trying to be political about this but if you're going to play this game you can you can be liberal about it\nYou can't it's not a liberal game you've got to be top and you've got to understand that if you're not fighting for something\nAnd there's no ... than it looks like that\nIt looks like when there is no cause it looks like that and you know what that's not what he coaches and what he represents I Know that I'm going to do that but as as the alumni and upset about that because you care and that's not worry about\nThat what do we lose forty eight out somewhere about that she's not worry about and he's going to fix it but you're right Ron it's about being passionate\nAnd caring 'cause there's nothing\nThere is no joke about football man jumped very aggressive and violent game and whoever is violent in a restaurant the longest doesn't screw up usually wins that game ... violent aggressive the longest and doesn't screw up\nWhy stay violent and the question you asked that will cause and it's almost like there was no cause that we are fighting for caught but we're going to fix it because we have great coaches in your fiction or like you have like you know it was very upsetting\nAgree with that and and you know you're going to fix it if it means playing eleven freshmen on either side of the football it looked like I said give me guys that are going to have some hard gimme guys that are going to have passion to play this game play the game the right way played with a high level of incense so wrong and you got a whole\nLot of these guys go for college education right I Know\nWell gee I I got you line up and you get a last ten years in Berlin center Western Reserve you've come to our games uncovered are games like I got kids from Ellsworth and Berlin center coming out of that title you're talking about the man we don't let in ten years that they meant many times I've said a\nMan my teammate they're not ready to update they want to play for the pound for themselves for their brothers in arms and I just like you said it was just pointing\nAnd now it's a ... to pick it up that's how I feel that the guy from Youngstown if we're going to get out of town or the out of town or if we're going to pass up guys in the valley all the time than the addict counters better pick it up and that's how I feel that's not a slight get a coach but that guy get catch college football and\nPass up on a lot of guys in the area and we have a foot fall rich area and we had in football needs a lot of guys in the ... and and this area or a patch on a lot of guy and he had a kind of got to pick it up and that just how I feel man\nLearn while writer on their downfall right now I guess that serious pay money here it's not it's not just about football ...\nIt's about your college and university making money\nLike they die commanders or all talking about Ron interests Hackett\nYeah no absolutely and I think that you know to to uh to go on top of your to your point coach you know this is an area look young stone is special Youngstown is an area where you know we get knocked down to the ground we get back up and we start slugging people I mean this is this is a town that is\nAs hard core blue collar as you're going to get and we love a blue collar product\nToday was anything but a blue collar products and that maybe that's one of the things that we need to fix his his is to have the football team more like this area more like the moaning valley where we are a blue collar we are tough as nails and this is\nWhat I Want to play football when you're a kid it's like the ... why do you play football rod you play because you love the game because you're playing the game to play with your friends you love cleaner family\nHe got to go back to the roots of things and if guys don't enjoy playing football they shouldn't be playing and then you know let me get the guys that love playing football that want to play football for Youngstown State because both lenient wanted a pest coaches in the country\nWhen it comes to football talking football you're not going to go round the guy that knows football more than ...\nGuided demands guy to be about what the game's about toughness\nCalculus troop toughness and being committed tough getting up every day going to

think I was moved by what she said write about you got to play the game because that's what\nI can I just called football numbers are down I'm In a league that that the numbers are wait out at a lot it for a lot of the schools why because people you've got to play this game for passionate and you learn so much from it and it's such a great day and we can't let the game go away and when someone starts talking about playing football because of passion\nYou're got darn right Ron you're right and that's when it comes out\nAnd he thinks for the call my brother appreciate it\nWas made such a good
