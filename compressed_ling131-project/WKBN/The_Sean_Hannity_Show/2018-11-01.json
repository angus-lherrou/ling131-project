the election countdown is on the midterms are just six days away and President Trump is back on the campaign trail rallying voters in Fort Myers Florida Republicans\nA Rush Limbaugh has been blamed Russia's pro Israel Russia's friends with baby I've been friends with baby over two decades I was friends with Shimon Peres a hoot Iraq and many other Israeli leaders Ron ... is a personal friend of mine\nAnd it's pretty outrageous that this is that they feel justified and making any incendiary comment they want\n[noise] well that's right and I think that's part of what was going to touch them and selection because the American people like and Kevin secrecy and what's really happening in the country and the American people I Believe are prepared to work a party and the movement\nWhich has the courage to try to save the country\nThat straight from work and so um I Believe the next Tuesday working on a great deal\nAbout the nature of America well to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy elections or because the people just shrug off the ranch and say that's not true I don't believe\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate\nBut you know I'm always I guess I'll just 'cause I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them\nThat's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House\nOr been able to gain seats it looks like will gain them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense too close to call\n[noise] oh I think that's right yup lesions um you know why we\nAre pleased every game or it can be rebels are starting to pass some kind of with the Tea Party rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan with concrete Monica a rebellion many ways created ... then for them that rebellion\nThe result is you now have states like North Dakota\nThe Montana on the jury or the west Virginia where there is a huge base that believes that they're involved in a car and it causes more than just everyday politics and I think it's it's just fascinating to watch\nBecause I think the media doesn't get it show up my my newsletter they'll come up tomorrow basically search on the planet side there's over ... you can if you're talking about a ... ah the Mitch McConnell Donald Trump\nTeam is going to be in control center and people say well so I don't have every judge for the next few years would have been blocked a showman\nSick about that all of those workers have been done which has been historic animation will come to a halt\nThe minute the Democrats control the Senate suggest in terms of judge this is a very consequential election and I looked at item after item after item on an icy\nThen we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is we're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay they view ever not had the courage to speak your mind that this is not true well you know let's not look I'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind because I think we shouldn't take anything for granted like\nI Believe that Marsha Blackburn is going to win I Believe that ... going to win in Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is gonna win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and it's interesting to look up to a different levels you have ... Mendez on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nGuilt or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nBuilt to having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else now pulling it back in New Jersey is we're going to go out you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see you know I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare all sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very alive and it's very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted doing that and if you end up not election they do not do anything else that day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year um the\nHouse is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWell not functionally ah I I my personal range is between the bottom of about ... ... which would mean policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up with speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't him in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd they're hard to have to house and people are like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you again she's smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services um and she goes down the last one I think to yourself\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all you don't like them or is it sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting\nIs in effect a half a vote for Nancy closer to the next week um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell them if there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection and every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the the same in the Senate races you know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for\nReticent in Tennessee you're you're voting for humor and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they're going to vote to be their leader\nBut I just tell everybody and he wanted to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat asked for the voting for for a leader can say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house of of course someone from that she closely but you know and I sort of have to do that fine\nDefeat them there are a level if they said you owe I'm really kind of a moderate Democrats you know I got to vote for Schumer defeat them who's kidding how long hair\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence that this is a team sport 'cause the radical wing of the Democratic party is in control of your body that their leadership or his his orderly and acceptable and then I think we have an obligation to uh\nTo feed them and the way to treat them as to make sure you're not\nUm listen I got to tell you that's the main thing let me play for use some of the more recent comedy played Joe

think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us well\nThis is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in and which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money ... exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where people want to continue to the America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck or people are able to get jobs consumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nTo where you had overregulation where you had high taxes you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the AT T the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job for the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that are democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine and found it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is\nThe unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles we may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district a and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're\nPretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nNot fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going
