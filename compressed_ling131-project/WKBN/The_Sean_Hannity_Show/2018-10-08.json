call and thank you sir for like saying that getting running on by your alright well\nHow about that anyway so if I tell if I say supplementary I got to give that guy credit that's like a ... why does it I Love that hook line and sinker yes\nSee here's a if I say but say he said listen you did better than that ... they know better than that but if I say I did better than that seems unbelievable that kind of temper the results down to what they really are because now I Want to dissect has called for I think he made some\nVery important point and a twenty percent and you made so important point Cesar\n... remain one other important point God I came from where they were more interested in what they could make him out what I could make with\nThe ... the ... the buying and selling that's what drives me crazy with you when you say well ... you know you you you don't speak ill of people in your profession I Do All right do you want or you know what that guy who I ain't got what that guy just told you was I wasn't being treated very good where I came from it was more about that buying and selling of making commissions\nWell no I'm Serious lesson here me he said that those folks that are competing with are here to defend themselves so one I'm listening to him I Know I Know but the reason why don't manager or like I I criticize my competition is not fair to them they're not here to give their story to I used to be them\nI Know but you're not anymore so you know at the end of the day I Believe\nIn my heart of hearts that they're just doing what they know how to do they're not slating anybody\nOil to I I I'll go with what he had to say no oh no fat sorry let's go next to Richard in Canfield you're on with John Arnold\nHi Hi go ahead sir\nI'm interested in what John thinks about Alabama and um\nOh um Amazon what [laughter] what\nI thought you were asking for a sports you sounded like you said Alabama what they'll let me answer that I think it has to kick ass off the ship I thought he did say I don't know how Alibaba wall change to China's aims hiked up the sports [laughter] and\nI Can't I'm not allowed to get a recommendation on the radio let me just say this I'm very bullish on both of them I'm scared to death of Alibaba only because it's in Chinese markets communist country and the Chinese markets were allowed to print whenever they want in the newspaper report whatever earnings that they want to report granted it's an eighty are but at the end of the day we have\nNo um [noise] we have no realistic ... legal power over them\nOther than they really can list on our exchange if we didn't they didn't play by the rules are than the eighty our rules I mean China can say we're making X amount of dollars per share and you just have to choose to believe him and I don't so\nHere's the short answer to your question I Try to stay away from Chinese stocks because I think the risk reward is not there\nIf if you can buy domestic stuff and get the same returns or better like Amazon and they have to they have to abide by FCC regulations on the reporting in Sarbanes Oxley they don't want to go into domestic right so\nI see so if if it's if if I think I can get the same or better return into domestic that's what I'm going to do but I'm very bullshit and both of them about what saint ... be very careful of any eighty are especially the Chinese media right now because like\nI say well you're quite average Amazon\nAnd not done very well enough or it looks like ah some of the stock forecasts indicate you could make a bond money on a Alibaba\nYeah you ... you know the key word there is good you know shouldn't go to what uh so you're on the stage in a you know I don't know if he goes to the program and we were in the Amazon territory between three and four hundred and eighty Ninety nine today popped out in two thousand so\nYou know I'm a player in the Amazon so and I and you know I'm not BS and you 'cause if you listen to show I called about four years ago so I'm again risk reward if you're a player and you want that risk\nYou know I don't know how does it get change you can make a lot of money when I'm ...\nI'm a big player in Amazon I order stuff off [laughter] it's just a few big wigs no\nWell this is a Chinese or um stock market in a kind of a recession right now\nI wouldn't call it that I Would call it a more of a pullback called yeah I see so I\nWill main thing is Richard and I just wanna make sure you take your questions\nYour question\nWell you did you did answer that question and gave me your opinion about Amazon versus a Alibaba appreciate it\nAlready now would you like a question about Alabama at all in what you're thinking about is the cost of what I like Alabama [laughter] All right thanks rich [laughter] All right to could get ugly there he likes Alabama a news radio five Seventy to carry on with John O'Brian a new water for go ahead please six fifty five\nGuys that show thank you I got a question here when you when you're having a little conversation with someone you say man the economy's doing really good about that stock market and the first thing they do it's come back and say well not every once in the stock market\nWell they're in eighty one way or another they are but go ahead [noise]\nRight I I just would like that for you to give me a good comeback noticed smart you know what comeback but just to make send them back and and the same thing when you say that for one case are really up in a strict\nNot everyone at all and K\nWell that's true not everyone does everybody ... that's the beauty of America as everybody has an opportunity to get into an IRA right right so what they're saying is I'm a poor decisions and shame on you for not making the borders\nColor I've ever thought of maybe getting different friends that aren't sort [laughter]\nBut you you know what I'm saying\nThat I Know but there isn't a listen I I think they're right in the fact that a strong economy doesn't directly correlates with strong mark vice versa but I Will say here's where it is if you if you have more jobs right now\nMore jobs and people and you got better you know the best and employment and fifty years\nIf you're not in a job that has a ... or ... or ... or in Iran or if you're not putting money away even under the bed shame on you\nThat that that's so when I say well I'm not in the stock market well then that means you decided not to be in the stock market you can run somebody for being an idiot you can't blame or they because they are and it is you can't blame somebody or making a bad decision if you're on a day you made your own bad decision\nAnd I was talking about personal responsibility what kind of who heard of that [laughter] you know like\nWhen I tried to want to say to
