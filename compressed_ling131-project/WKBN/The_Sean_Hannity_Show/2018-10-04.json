investigation\nWill be All right they've had the FBI investigation\nNow we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party that in every single case even though there is no cooperation\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know the data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis\nTo rape girls are winding up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups that's what that evolved into\nYou know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is for every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nI'm doing well and I think you know\nYou can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's what we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power a fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil\nThat's Rob how are the kind of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power\nAnd that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh they're lonely do it I Believe of impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week ... most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the basic decency\nA judge Kavanaugh one of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been\nA smear treated with a vicious personal attack all those things I think I mean that the Susan Collins who what was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson\nTo all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of what you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since ... how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you weren't resistance you've got a team called Democrats and he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the stage now to pit\nAnd spent the last five weeks telling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not push of a lot of work to do but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be do you want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs\nProfessional and promote ... are you prepared to be part of a team to one's constitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun when election night as we had in two thousand seven\nI mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house\nThink that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe

believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the hypocrisy here [noise]\nUm I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out their wealth discussed\nA and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nOut I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an alligator\n... and you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is\nA fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan

and I say that not because I had any faith and Democrats\nUp because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at a date or\nThirty percent margin that people want to

people get their humor lapdog but they might get out of their own political okay well that's exactly right well\nI mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski in like once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah it I mean [laughter]\nDon't get a real does wrong principle is man that bans on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's a conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is now the moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter]\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that if you're the thank you both for being

cases in scenarios that you've outlined that's a problem if all of a sudden you're accusing somebody\nOf something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happened because the accuser saying to them well she's not really sure what\nHappened then you got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were drug in girls almost on a weekend basis I went to some of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them and and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train raped as they were lying in the hall and then not balls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top\nAnd the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases no corroboration not the case of professor board not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweat and they know who are ...\nJoe ... tore tons to go with us the gentleman Toensing\n... both will be back to the program I'm Victoria and start with you get your take on all this\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody or we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nUh the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt ... I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got that far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun a bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris I'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was a California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do accusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have\nNow we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen\nWith Julie sweating it is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substitute education for miss Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied like her lawyers did not tell her\nThat the committee was willing to come to California to interview her fat is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise and remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats never catch by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the\nCase of Al Franken but I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules I\nI'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy except that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense\nAny victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe because we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations and charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats are they just they just now have pushed this so far into a ... ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence\nNo matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning I I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume it's probably people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent the shot us in happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kinda weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down I mean there are so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back\nMore with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next and then your calls coming a final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you have sunspots well our friends at Shawnee engineer so they came out with their brand new product it's a sunspot correct or now it's everybody's go to products especially after the summer it gets rid of sunspots age spots you're going to see a difference guaranteed of course or you get your money back\nAnd you can literally watch sunspots aged pots read in plain patches vantage right before your eyes\nAnd oh by the way all you have to do is order Jen you sell to get rid of bags and puffing on to your eyes and Sean many will give you Jen yourself sunspot correct or absolutely free\nYeah if we do know that she in the case of professor Ford she didn't know a day of the week location how she got to or from a location where the crime took place do corroborating evidence no forensic evidence if you don't know where it took place you can't even go back thirty six years later\nA and I'm an avid watcher of forensic files what they can now do and solve the unresolved crimes from decades gone by is pretty amazing and in sworn statements under penalty of felony\nYou know every one of the people that she mentioned would say something said just the opposite or yes don't remember it so there's no in that sense that is over for that case it was far as I'm concerned unless we had to just believe guilt by accusation\nBut again I agree on that is what they're doing the Democrats have now it's never enough ... they want more FBI but just a week now it's not enough\nYeah even though even though the week was proposed by senator Coons who has now as you can tell disappeared you can't find him now he's on a milk carton\nYeah no he's missing in action after we got everything you want what a what a Jeff Flake get out of this look I I don't think anybody can predict what the FBI now pending over their findings in the cabin or pro\nUm you know they still have not interviewed Christine forward but I Would imagine the FBI has not doesn't need to interview Christie board they have\nAll of her testimony don't they she testified under oath for very long period of time no interview by the FBI is going to add a thing yeah well\nIt gets very very tough and very scary but I Will say this if we lose due process if we lose the presumption of innocence

the issue I that's my honest take here's what we do know that matters facts truth matters serious allegations it's not about how it's presented it's whether or not it is credible\nAnd what we have is in the case of professor Ford no location how did she get to and from the where the alleged ... event took place\nMisconduct allegations et cetera et cetera um remember no corroborating evidence no

Seventy WKBD in Youngstown chime in seven o\nClock shop American source for fine art\nBy\nFormer Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and which are again it's a lifetime appointment this isn't a political decision if this were a political decision for me I certainly wouldn't be deciding that's the other way\nProfessor of Ford's account well they sprung into action and they began their own investigation and professor forwarded mentioned that there were four people at the party where this alleged assault had occurred\nAnd they did their due diligence and they interviewed the four people and under the penalty of a felony\nFour people went on the record\nAnd some didn't remember the party in any way shape or form including professor fourth one of our best friends\nAnd professor Ford at identified mark judge is the one guy that would have been an eye witness to this alleged assault back thirty six years ago he said absolutely positively did not happen\nAnd then when the Democrats you know and you have senator snowflake going along with senator Coons and all we just need a limited just limited in scope just a quick short investigation FBI they should be able to wrap it up\nWell in this case and we'll talk about the other cases as well well in this particular case we don't have a place we don't have the time we don't have a location we don't know the house we don't even know the exact year to be honest anyways so they had very limited\nRoom to to corroborate professor forward story and what they the only available venue for them or avenue for them to pursue this case remember\nThey were never going to make conclusions are recommendations that what we learn from Joe Biden back in Nineteen Ninety One anyway they sprung into action they went out we had already had professor Ford's\nA testimony now multiple points you know even though there was some inconsistencies between her testimony before the Senate entered test and the account that she had given to the Washington Post and her attorney failing to hand over any evidence as regards in regards to how the polygraph was\nAdministered or any of the therapy notes that they willingly handed over to the Washington Post\nThey would not hand that over to the FBI so Deborah cats who was the liberal activist attorney for professor Ford has donated tens of thousands of dollars to liberal causes and candidates and she's the one that set off Paula Jones ... come on I was only ten twelve minutes\nI mean that doesn't constitute any type of work for sexual harassment well that shows she's not consistent on the issue that was the person recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nWho's making the recommendation while she's meeting privately with judge Kavanaugh and not telling him a thing that any of this is going on that's the left wing activist lawyer though that professor port I or don't blame her I mean Dianne Feinstein was the one that suggested at all\nAnyway so the only avenue for the FBI to pursue in the case professor Ford was to ask\nThe for people that are ready testified under the penalty a felony the same questions that you would normally asked were you there do you have a recollection no no no no no and mark judge your supposedly an eye witness did you see this behavior this account of professor ports happened no\nAnd after that I don't see any other area where the FBI has any investigative tool available to them to go down and discuss\nThe story there already been told by judge Kavanaugh as his passionate denial and the story been told and varying accounts and the Washington Post and when professor Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt wasn't that hard a job for the FBI Democrat says oh now the fixes it what are you talking about\nWhat what else can they do at that point\nWhat other investigative tools they have\nIf somebody makes a serious allegation about a a serious crime committed\nAnd they identify an eye witness in the room at the time of the alleged attack in the eye witness denies it the person that has accused denies it there's no other\nVenue avenue of of investigation that they need to go into but they went further even though the New York times had well a lot of problems with Mrs Ramirez his story this is the this is the case that happened that was printed\nBy the New Yorker remember that particular case and in the ... case she was claiming well back in the first year when he was a freshman in college said he exposed himself to me well after the New Yorker piece came out then the New York times\nThey went out for over a week interviewing their words not mine dozens of people all and then the attempt to corroborate the story of Mr Amir as New York times reported they could find no one with first hand knowledge nobody times doesn't like Donald Trump\nAnd then they also pointed out a bit of information that was a little bit scary and they found out that Mr Ramirez herself had been contacting former yell classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them that she could not be certain if Mr\nKavanaugh was the one who exposed himself well I hate to say it based on her own words that point that's it that cases over add to it\nOwn admission achieved quickly became a ... and ... that the party that she was foggy slurring her words and admitting in her own words that she had significant memory gaps from the evening so the New York times couldn't corroborate the stories\nAnd of course we've got door number three allegation number three and that was the case of Julie sweat Nick\nAs soon as the woman that as being represented by the attorney of the year for the Democratic party Michael em Ali\nAnyway a lot of credibility issues as it relates to her and we saw all of her allegations blow up the sheep backtrack big time\nOn her story in an interview that I don't think ever should've aired on NBC News because she gave the names of for people that she said would be able to corroborate her story and well they couldn't find two of them or they wouldn't respond one of his dad and the other one said she ... they don't even know who Julie sweating it is I've never heard of this person so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey hunting season is upon us we're gonna learn some tips for calling and telling\nVulgar next time on Buckeye sports we're joined on
