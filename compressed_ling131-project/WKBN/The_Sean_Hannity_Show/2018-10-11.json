indispensable to a thriving and vibrant societies shields citizens from government overreaching and arbitrary action\nPursuing truth means always yelling the facts [noise] even if they run counter to our house in a courtroom truth is about credible evidence strong opinions\nAbout there's a lot of talk about ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAre and that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out that in any incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know a sign that but as David to get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and burned it to be true\nOh that didn't work out with the third renewal buys application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews and those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where\nThere's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nI'll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one\nAnd I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio and more on the latest why won't Rod Rosenstein answer these questions under oath\nAnd want to talk about your home security protecting your family that simply St Paul security the best home security system on the market even

I need to give out the numbers of Trey Gowdy is office and chairman good last office and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing up with a third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that that truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final Pfizer warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not a show and we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about declassify what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh a chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five\nFifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath\nAh thank you so much congressman mark\nOh thank you congressman Jim Jordan and we appreciate your Bush but the truth we need to get to the bottom of the [noise]\nAll

damage or from the wind and also from the flooding that is going to be associated with the writing\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics and he's the Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise] um and you know we just don't know that but\nYou're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was anathema to fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnish state just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be and show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump\nTo maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nAnd showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAnd I ended up parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not\nAll of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called treasonous they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this cycle pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and Kavanaugh you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach math to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that the toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic or the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not\nAh in positions of power and will not be able to run the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and I and that is not just made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity\n'em and add money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like Kevin McCarthy introduced which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nNear future ... and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... importance to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and tropical ready has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat or you know that that could come open if Trump wins reelection it may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's going to happen if that seat comes open has the potential six three conservative majority on the court\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at ... and again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen I quit\nFollowing all of the deep state movements\nNow the issue today we just had on Mark Meadows in Jim Jordan talking about a Rod Rosenstein is now saying he doesn't want to appear before the a house Judiciary Committee on the issues are before them\nAnd that is the latest one that Lisa Page Andrew McCabe James Baker of all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talked about surreptitiously taping the president\nOf the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThose are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing of James called me the

wouldn't they wanna testify Greg Jared under oath\nDoesn't want to transcribe the interview or anything under oath or which chairman Goodlatte and others are demanding why\nIf it's not recorded or not under oath Rosenstein can do what he always does this leave and the lie with impunity without putting in self\nIn legal jeopardy too what Rosenstein really watches oh you know Mr good lot which is you know I sit down and have a cup of coffee and we'll chat a little bit too if Rosenstein words ally as as I suspect he might\nUm he doesn't he's not looking at a fashion misleading statement of Congress he's not looking at\nPerjury because he can always deny the conversations that good ... remembers the which which is why this is so critically important\nOr they've got they got a subpoena him and they've got a demand to show up and they've got to put them under oath and these answers have given but\nUh I got to let you bumped or do we write great job great Jared congrats on the successor the

Andrew did that ... that I was in at its peak when it came into Florida which we're getting off its peak\nMost of these hurricanes have we've been blessed and not like the thirties forties and fifties that hit on their peak now as far as the storm it's it it made landfall\nAs a borderline category five I'm ... and when it's all done they may call it a category five I'm not sure they're going to go

I Hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican camp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and Rasmussen\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana that can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think uh\nFor the lead Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should have been a longtime friend of this program in recent polls now how her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television and we're picking ... important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering of a big portion and percentage of seats\nI ended up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and it's going to be campaigning for everybody in these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts on health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting them we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world and we got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either\nYou know I Want to get in Michelle Obama was on the today show earlier today in an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be civil with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo all over my wife went really tight voice scare me [laughter] so you know when they go low we go [laughter] go low we go [noise]\nWe'll just different radical ideas about\nCannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fear is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid to their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional wondering Michelle Obama say anything when\nSarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist mobs\nAnd they are moms and this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the quote so coal leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nTo go on your friends your neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican or you're with them in their face a pretty good I'm not at the foot miss a purchase on Fox News\nAlso is a missile further up against a Sean Hannity alone\nThat when someone is cruel or like a bully you don't just sit there level now our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high you\nKnow they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witnessed with judge Kavanaugh would know due process known presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that isn't paid\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you don't follow them in the gas stations in grocery stores\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the [laughter] that ... he can start to get\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\nA gathering thank\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill

of Obama national security adviser Susan Rice or something happens to be a conservative\nIn fact his name is John rice hammer and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote shoved him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nAs a student news outlet citing a stamper department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's requests and issued a citation for battery\nStamford daily quoted a

the party of the constitution and due process and presumption of innocence you know these values have served as well as a country for a long time\nAnd now with a very pathetic and sad and frankly now alarming state and I honestly think that Rand Paul is not off base when he says that this rhetoric is going to lead to somebody getting killed at some point\nWhen Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence and not even live next door to you don't know
