they're losing the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a Neal is the violence a which in the end I think\nTurns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise] you know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYeah I think look I I think he is the fourth\nA cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and the and I think it just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned this on your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators incentive meetings I think all that came together to really really galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost\nTwenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage that Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she doesn't want to draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of the galaxy the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win was legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way\nTo turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's

the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border with the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update uh apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what are the Democrats what did they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the board our problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using in this I Can't even believe this district you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful or the president while he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done\nThat in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor and any sense of constitutional\nOr authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want to Ninety One\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight

doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I maybe it doesn't have the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you know one thing
