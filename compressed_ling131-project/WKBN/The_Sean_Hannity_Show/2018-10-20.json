party ticket because they know they can't win a head to head match anyway but time to put your party light on\nIt is friday these week they're tough Eighteen days believe all important midterm and

and about only bring the brain that are no man [noise]\nAll broken hearted\nDay I'd be feeling alone\n... they\nThey may or\nReal meaning me\nAnd a little bit of Jake and try\nFirefox or actually opens up like right away 'cause right Kurt Google and throw a on the machine it down at the bottom corner occurs waiting for Google sentiment permission to go on go\nAnswering better to double click click I don't I don't go to look at the X ray machine\nOkay so you repeat that 'cause I I last year at some point there so you you have you're saying you have Firefox as a ... in both locations and when you go to Firefox on XP it's fast and it you just type in something and it goes there on the window seven now this is where I lost you so you you open up Firefox and you type in your health and what to do\nOn a corner Kristin lord permission to go all cancers\nWaiting for Google a performing kill their own ... for double click crediting double click click on TALK of going through all the steps that ... didn't go\nOkay what I Want you to do is reset the browser so when you go into your settings and control panel there are some options that will allow you to clear like the temporary files and the cash and stuff like that I'm I'm thinking that you might even have to delete the the Firefox profiling recreate it\nUm if it's not a networking thing if you're for sure you're DNS was working which if it's working on the other one I'm pretty sure that it's okay to\nYou don't have any weird settings and there were struggling to be able to get to setting and if you don't have proxy enabled then your profiles probably damage and you might have to either and install reinstalled Firefox or re created a new user profile and clean out all of the temporary and the cash that's in there and that that'll probably speed it up a little bit\nOkay sounds good [noise] the other question is are networked wireless network and I correct assuming that the base ... hooked filtered router you can start a fire wall and then your other PCs and laptops in the household\nA will kind of under that wall and and the reason I'm asking is if if there was a malicious program say on a laptop and they want to communicate with the Internet without my permission I watched\nAll right so your your router is going to be most of doing what we did the fire walling so you have income and connections coming in the router defense against us now you also have a firewall that's on each individual computer in each individual computers responsible for protecting that computer and the data from fetching and and moving things around\nAnd so you kind of what both for in that circumstance is not one computer won't cover the rest of them because you're a gateway is actually the router okay so each one\nConnects to the router directly not going through the other computers so what I'd probably do on on windows seven machines are and when does it have in in in windows ten just used the built in fire wall that's in control panel make it set it up so that your\nConnection to the gateway is is a protected those two things that protects you from fetching coming in and it also fetch it protects you from computer to computers of your computer ain't got infected and goes out to your network and tries to infect other computers the firewall gives you a chance of it blocking those connections\nOkay very good okay you have a great show Joe\nOh thank you so much appreciate you being out there I take care of a good weekend a and you know they ... if I'm ... most\nOf us is seeing you know you you have your router you\nHave the software that's on the route or you have the default connections usually by default they they won't allow traffic to come from the outside world\nInto your computer it has to be initiated from computer going to the outside world and so that's kind of what you want now it's not the it's not the ... so you you know ... some local firewall protection where we used to not recommend that as much as we do right now the way that viruses in malware is working it actually gives you a\nFair chance and defending against him our infection and corruption virus in something like that so windows updates very important to keep windows always on his most recent version with all of the patches that come along every couple of Tuesday's a month so All right we're going to take a break a we have another call coming up bill I see out there hang tight\nUh and were to take this break come back you're listening to the young south computer show on five Seventy

in your case that technology changes so much you're you're not taking advantage of what's capable of\nOf being out there and we use it so often we don't want to skimp on something that is so important in our in our local network and where you say that your router you got from your service provider the first time through\nMore like ... years which they didn't really show\nAnd and when when you get when you sign up for service you pay a monthly fee for that equipment and so that way if they if it goes down they bring you a new one so what you might want to do um uh they don't let you opt out of that usually so you're going to pay that regardless\nI Want to call them first and see what equipment they have that you can swap out for a lot of notes it's kind of aged and you're ready for a new one and see if you can get that equipment for the same price without having to buy your own I always prefer ... my own equipment I can do more with it I can control the settings you know it's just more open for a guy like me to be able to use it but that's not everybody\nIf I were to buy one show which were were amend much we could work hard\nI'm In the ... if you're doing mesh wireless I Love that Google why fight I mean it it worked out so well for ... in my place um if you just want a central router that has the antennas on it or we're using the links is a sea routers they've got a couple of nice sized antennas\nUp I wouldn't go kill I mean they've got five hundred dollar routers that's not for you it's probably the two hundred dollar one is more what you're looking at at that

school down a bit you you'll see a section for parodies people been asking me to post my priorities for a while\nNow so I've done that is also a section for interviews a section for monologues and some some news stories on the left inside\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions\nOr was it the ... when it was nobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine\nThat would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth\nWarren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes\nIf it's okay for them it's okay for me she's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to schools for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first\nWoman of color to be a professor at Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\n\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given any bit of evidence\nTo suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls her Pocahontas I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it aren't very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou don't like Rachel does all who's white like Sean King who's white you know they're both pretend to be black Elizabeth Warren\nIt seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\n\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones\nProves that no that doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said you a DNA test if you could prove to be the year in India and I'll give it a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess it really does a DNA test get to the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe what'd you say far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American\nThey say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\nAnd then the Boston Globe out to four hours later updated and correct it and say well the most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into\nThe actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\n\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close\nWas was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBut the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American this group that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren\nThat's a fact I mean making it up it's a fact\nShe's not America in American indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself or did he or\n\nIs so not American indian that the Cherokee Nation\nCome out and asked her to just stop now\nOr what made the bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nSharing the Cherokee Nation is racist retelling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which we live\nGuy looked at stake in it anytime you go through\nThis week figuring that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself while she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story any ... any of us should even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about this nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up\nAgain and you ask yourself is that what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this for even a second yet for some reason\nWe had to have her thrust of this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a packs power to you about the color Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you don't really with

hear you know people say to me what my guy guys Trump is on the you know he's on the ballot or something I could go and vote and I go please you can't think that way you have to get out and vote idiots so critically important I mean\nDo as a country where winning I mean everything about our country is winning right our economy is on fire at Fort Point two percent GDP Growth three point nine percent unemployment the lowest unemployment in history or a nation we've got three percent wage growth which is the first time wages have gone up and sixteen years\nYou know we have um the largest military spending we have the largest tax cuts in history a manufacturing is coming back to our nation for one k.'s or through the roof and small businesses are paying Fifteen Percent less in taxes than they were\nA year ago which is just created such a you know financial engine\nUm I mean we are doing so incredible and that's before you start talking about you know prison reform which needs to be done and opioid crisis he's taking on a Supreme Court justices and\nPrescription drugs no one wants to talk about that everything that he's done to lower the cost of prescription drugs you know something that is is is so keen on his mind you I'm you know ... and no one wants to talk about it but it it it's we're winning we're not getting ripped off like China anymore we're not getting ripped off by Mexico anymore you know we're finally negotiating good trade deals\nYou know the Chinese economy right now is you probably know better than anybody is down you know ... almost twenty five percent right right oh while America has the strongest economy that's ever had said who's winning this thing right and and\nThat's what he promised the American people he was getting Daley promised the American people he was going to come in and he was going to win we're no longer get used and abused as a country and but people have to get out there they have to get out and vote\n... Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump drops away right but I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country usually moves all the advertising is saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate ... the top one percent of the vast majority of tax cuts everybody else got nothing ... that's not true everybody who pays ... got a tax cut in corporations who employers got a tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the large when you see them flying around with him about it\nHonestly they're truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty and politics again this is this in a world right where is this people were not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world these people are truly the most dishonest people in the entire world I mean\nYou look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or\nYou know dozens and dozens of millions of small businesses right all across our\nOur nation their get their pay Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he slash regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest\nHispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\nDo you know this better name but you'd have a trade deal with with with China where\nIf you said the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent in ... right where they could make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean who do you think's gonna win that battle I mean if it's absolutely unbelievably uh we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean it it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBelieve me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nFor Trump to sort of president Donald Trump ulcer drop it a national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go bows or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding\nEmployees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone they slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're going to do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're going to do with them and made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with them and made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the back and how we're just said\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare wrote touting Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world you know those people to keep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars\nAnd healthcare costs you know food through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the prescription drug um legislation that road has drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at a\nRight to try you look at so many of these different efforts and\nYou know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves elected so their sales people that's not who he is I mean he's he's the one guy who's probably ever come into government who had the worst of life you know then then\nAnd what

that Democrats are they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think\nThat you eat so much for defense out there is because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump winning for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life in over and they knew it before and and it's very scary for people who are living to highlight in Washington DC or not go in and and voting on the ... there can actually went\nOut and make them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's he's doing this because he loves his country to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more than that we need\nRadio by

Georgia will get the start and also today that for our our leading receiver it's coach ... decision he will not play for our today so we lose Baldwin and Randall Posey due to injuries that for an applying to the coaches decision those are some key piece of that [noise]\n... yes they are in a you know during the year and you have some coaches decision things going on there you know you have to get the mental psyche of his team right I think we're we've lost some players with Robin and on the office of line they feel very comfortable there three deep attack all their four or five deep but linebacker obviously they're used losing a little bit [noise]\nBut uh you know part of this is getting this mental thing right with the coaches decision and part of it is next man up I mean you know when you have a program like coach for me and he's put together you're going to have injuries during the season and uh those teams during the year that kind of put it back together you know are the ones that are going to win more more of the games\nWill talk about South Dakota a little more in depth after our interview with coach Fellini as Youngstown State on the field docked continuing their warm ups but this is also\nA special night halftime ounce downstate going to honor the twenty fifth anniversary of the Nineteen Ninety three national championship team and our helmets\nHave a a silver stripe on them tonight and that is emblematic of the silver anniversary twenty five years of a team that beat marshal won the championship game Seventeen divide that was the second of three championship teams for Jim ...\nAnd the third of four straight years playing in the championship game that was mark ... guard quarterback team running backs darn out Clark camera Smith I was quite a run in the early ...\nGlory days and for all of you remember an out there and it seemed like it never what happened right right and it was rolling rolling rolling I Can't believe that it's twenty five years and you're not doing anything you know Ron said how bad the weather as well um I don't know how it's going to be\nHonest I I see people in shorts down their\nHawaiian shirts we gotta get 'em down here for eight to twenty five years I got special how much special group of guys that kind of late the base along with coach dress all laid the base for the football program and the you know when you're out and you got a why on your shirt\nI don't care where you practice when you go outside the elements are going to affect you like in Michigan Michigan State game today when the ball gets wet ... but when you're throwing team and you you you you practice inside\nOr you're a kicker and all you do this practice inside that you go outside and they're forty mile an hour gusts than it's fifty five degrees and it's raining and the tailing ... you're going to have an impact so you know I I think it's that well for white issue today\nAlso we talked a little bit about why issue and things that need to get better we've it's still a radical in the ... and\nWe had another film will block last week we missed ... shoulder gets pulled his upon or that those are those hidden yards that added up during the course of the game like\nThat yeah it really is and as you know so stressful back then president trust will now used to really not take a look at the special teams as the other team he used to look at them equally as important sometimes even more important right the way you ponder than feel position was equally as important as often some defense\nBut if you look ahead of the whole team kind of has a pall over\nYou know with mistakes and and things going wrong it's got a you know we could go wrong would go wrong and you know you guys are the first couple of weeks were kind of bright spots including Montgomery border rights taken a couple of steps back so it's catchy but when it's when it's bad it's bad and when it's good roles so hopefully we can\nGet it rolling again here to the

referee my salads are up higher post genocide Lyman\nFrank bullets flying jets matches rivals side judges to orange stores still judge ... judge Phil votes from Norwalk in Ohio and we do have replay official\nAnd replace them indicator as well so any place that I made the controversial close to the terminal sports players will be will do that because the weather is likely to be a factor later we have someone let's go to Mike now like your spouse who joined us on the sidelines game did this before ... by I don't really smooth hand\nAnd body free formulated my you know from my\nThat when much of a factor it looks like it's a slowdown someone down there yeah guys the when not a factor right now but they are calling for to be a factor maybe in the second quarter for the rest of the game and wind advisory\nAt seven o'clock been standing in the morning so [noise] you\nGot to feel that the when really temperature continue to drop down here it's about fifty degrees down here on the field right now but it is going to give you often just looking at the radar seems it's raining everyone at Ohio in western Pennsylvania bought in young tells the hopefully we can get a forty hour window right now to get the game and it\nCan be interesting to see what the defense is paying when defense you look at the secondary in this quarterback for South Dakota Austin's images put up Matt in numbers but\nWatching them on film years really got rid of the ball very quickly this year as a more secondary can older coverage for just a second longer the pain went up front defense why they can get them sex through this all federal South Dakota given up I'm loving sex in the past three game so that's what I'm going to look for early in this game here\nAnd Mike as environment I almost look at it the same way but a little different in that great pressure you know allows those defensive backs only to cover those guys for maybe a half a second less so I think it goes hand in hand but but with a with a guy that\nGets rid of it and and throws up that much it's imperative that you play team defense today and keep that ball in front of you and don't give them the extra time to look at the second receiver\n[noise] this is the ASPCA pregame show much more to get to when we come back we'll continue on after this on the home of the penguins five Seventy WKBD in [noise]\nIn the ASPCA you
