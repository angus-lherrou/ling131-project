of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nThat it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hauled and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat\nIn all of the states that the red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale

happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then

real\nFuture as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of

this has definitely caused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats\nAre the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really\nPolitics this is a kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is playing out in Washington DC right now we're going to be the dark thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used\nI think what's happening is it's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west\nUm they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nYou're going to defend Europe the love liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\nThat's right he had to get Shawn on could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be a backlash on the left is wild you know um there are concerns about\nAh the nominee or their contents they take action wasn't\nCave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber to our own words that she was a ... D quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim\nA judge Kavanaugh was a serial drug gr and rapists the teenage girls so give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not don't yeah I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking it\nWas a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I Know and the FBI did\nNot use I mean why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmates and I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift and backtrack\nFrom her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not during the negotiations that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of ... people are saying those they\nDon't recall those stories at all that ... or that happened that way at all\nSo the judge is our culture and that thing on at the last twenty four hours a ... about uh the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe and the and the and the presumption of innocence but I also believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that such an energizing that you don't have\nA talking point what I was on a second once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else did the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nAnd yelled ... question do you have any corroborating witness\nOr any corroborating evidence at all you can say right now\nThat have been on the question that as an unseen\nReally I got an unfair question Jonathan I don't think it's unfair to them\n... ...

Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still is and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a\nA good heart but I really feel\nHe's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that he'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds sounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it's just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a\nSee get people leave to Washington and come back a

here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy that no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it it is so it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\nThou shall not their falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and\nA media hysteria that that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people with innuendo falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all the things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws\nAt some

responsible for sticking a needle in their arm and becoming addicted to drugs that's a disease not a bad choice and you should pay for their treatments and a\n... if we have a mentality look at like you say your property taxes all the money that's taken from productive people your property taxes to take care of everybody else you shouldn't really have to pay a realistic fair to ride the bus it's

Supreme Court nomination and so far it looks like he could be confirmed\nMr President I Will vote chicken from judge cabin\nThey simply road\nThat they oppose Donald Trump nomination out acts\nTo the Supreme Court of the United states a number of senators joined the race too and now they're repetition but they were me to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition\nBe bored that no I'm In the aged identity what even know\nSince that time we had seen special interest groups with their followers in to a friend said by spreading misrepresentation an outright falsehoods about judge Kavanaugh judicial record\nThe top rhetoric\nAnd just stores and stuff his record and testimony edits first airing produce short lived headlights which also did by ... hours later continue to live on and the spread through social media\nInterest groups that ball that will stand and unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than thirty year one can\nOnly hope\nThe cabin uh nominated and it's where the process has finally had\nAgainst the backdrop for it is sad to see each individual senator to the side\nWhat the constitution that advice and consent duty main informed by Alexander Hamilton federalist Seventy six [noise]\nI have interpreted says to me that the president has broad just Gretchen considerate nominees philosophy whereas\nMy duty yet because senator is to focus on the nominees qualifications as long as that nominees philosophy is within the main stream of judicial thought\n[noise] I have always supposed to limit has for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics\nBut I fully expect them to be able to put a side any and all personal preferences in deciding the case the sec come before that\nI never can fit or the president the damned if he or party wet enough value waiting Supreme Court nomination as a result\nI voted in favor of Justice Roberts and Alito who were nominated by President Bush\nJustice Souter my or end its cage and who weren't nominated by President Obama and justice Gorsuch who was nominated by President Trump [noise]\nSo I began my evaluation of judge Kavanaugh's nomination by reviewing his twelve year record\nOn the DC circuit court of appeals including has more than three hundred opinions and his many speeches and law review article nice chain is turning\nIncluding lawyers from the non partisan congressional Research Service\nFreaks me many times each week and it says to me in the value waiting the judges extensive record\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my uh 'cause I've listen carefully to the testimony at the committee Harry I spoke with people who knew him personally such as ... civil rights\nAnd many out there and I talked with judge cabinet or a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions [noise]\nI also have met with thousands and some of my constituents spoke to advocate and many opponents regarding judge Kavanaugh\nWind concern that I frequently heard was that the judge would be likely to a lemonade the Affordable CARE Act vital protections for people with preexisting conditions\nI just to grieve would vest contends show and it just sent in seven sky the holder judge Kavanaugh rejected that challenge to be a C A R narrow procedural grounds per serving the law in full\nMany experts have said that his dissent in foreign Justice Roberts' opinion up holding the A. C. A. at the Supreme Court [noise]\nFurthermore judge cabinet on approach toward the doctrine of separate belote is narrow wind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing be invalid laws\nAs ... as possible while allowing the overall law to remain in Chad\nFits what's his approach in his says send in a case that involved a challenge\nTo the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his stand judge Kavanaugh I argued for quote severing any problematic portions wells and leaving the remainder intact\nAnd quote given the current challenge just to be a TA proponents including my cell phone protections for people with preexisting conditions should want to adjust his who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother surge than that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if I have to fall ... alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nSaid base for ... to argument seems to be twofold first judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution\nOr civil liability while in up\nTo president I Believe opponents miss the mark on the issue the fact that judge a cabinet I offered this legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection current play\nSecond\nThere are some who argued that given the current special counsel investigation\nPresident Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a job because of that argument ignores our recent history\nPresident Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three nominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway\nAnd she was come first served Ninety six to three\nThat next year just three months after independent counsel Robert ... was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar he was confirmed\nCarpet stations along with Sean Hannity show network we are going to stay with the brew our first break a continuous coverage\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against the president to have nominated them perhaps\nMost notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point she who heard the case joins the ... opinion against him\nJudge Kavanaugh I had been unequivocal in his belief that no president it's above the law he has stated that ... first in Madison\nYoungstown failed versus Sawyer and the United states for the next ... arts three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and the history\nWhy do they happen comments each of them\nIs to caged where Congress served as the check on presidential power\nAnd I would note that the fourth case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as some the greatest thing history was brown versus the board of education [noise]\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about the check on the president's empowered directly [noise] he wrote the opinion in harmed on birth to the United states had cases that challenge to the Bush administration military commission\nThe American bar association gave him its highest\nPossible raided it's standing committee on the federal judiciary conducted and Jordan narrowly thorough assessment from listening input from almost five hundred people including his judicial calling\nThe APA concluded that his integrity judicial temperament and professional confidence Mets the highest standards leads the black\nWho is sorry give more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman\nIn history

ardent and Meyer of Justice Ginsberg and who is in her own words and unapologetic defender up a woman's right to choose that that judge Kavanaugh fits with in the main stream of legal side\nShe also observed that judge Kavanaugh is remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession\nThat judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist since some buffet critics maintain it's reflected in the past that he and chief judge Merrick Garland voted the same way\nIn Ninety three percent of the cases that they heard together in the chief judge Garland joined him more than Ninety six percent of the majority opinion authored by judge Kavanaugh\nJust tempting only one [noise]\nDid bite at all then after we separate viewing judge Kavanaugh's record and listening to thirty two hours up his testimony\nSanta's said by and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by professor Christine ... seats for\nThe confirmation process now when the fall of value of waiting whether or not judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee [noise]\nSome argue that because since it's a lifetime appointment to our highest court\nCourt the public interest requires that doubts the resolve began the nominees\nOthers see the public interest as embodied in our longest tablets traditions of a boarding to those accused of misconduct\nA presumption of innocence in case the sandwich the facts are unclear they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominees\nMr President I understand both

faith and the judiciary and would be huge fully damaging to the confirmation process moving forward [noise]\nSome of the allegations levied against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the ... of innocence is so important\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor pork\nBut if the allegations that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drugs multiple girls and use their week and they kept ... gang re\nSpin out last is alec cage was put forward without any credible supporting evidence and simply parachuted public statements some father\nThat such an allegation\nCan find

Mr President\nThe constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims it leads to that because they're showing up to each senator\nThis is not a criminal trial and I do not believe that the claims such as these need to be\nProved beyond a reasonable doubt\nNever at the lab fairness would dictate that the clay at least should made a threshold of more likely than not as our standard\nJust giving a heads up again to the affiliate till the Sean Hannity show network Susan Collins this historic speech on the set of poor we will continue our coverage\nAnd cater to our views we can only expect\nOur differences to intensify\n\nThat's more than ... the draft or up our constitution who were acutely aware\nThat different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining of single people and the have the thick objective they invoked in the preamble choose the constitution\nThe one that they put for\nWhat's the formation of a more perfect union [noise]\nTheir vision of a more perfect union does not exist today and if anything we appear to be moving farther away from that it is particularly worries that the Supreme Court\nThe institution that most Americans see as the principle of guardian up our shared constitutional heritage is viewed as part of the problem\nThrough a political\nMr President we've heard a lot of charges and counter charges about judge Kavanaugh but as though who have known him that\nHave a test that he has been an exemplary public servants judge teacher cos husband\nJust by the turbulent bitter fight surrounding his nomination my\nFervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work ... less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer five four decision and so that the public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court\nIs three doors Mr President\nI Will vote\nTook him for judge Kavanaugh [noise] they've given us depressed [noise]\n\nI think one of the more amazing speeches and I I Am now it's actually interesting because I was a tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nAnd my Thirty years on radio\nThat was one of the most thoughtful speeches\nI think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm\nSusan Collins over the years was frustrated the living daylights out I mean we're opinion so I think what stands out more than anything else\nIs the the since fear ... how ... amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech and the gravity of the moment and and the un bringing literally\nA sense of sanity to what has become an absolute so she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge Kavanaugh his judicial temperament the questions that he's specifically answered her passion about\nOf especially didn't I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice and consent\nAnd the respect that she is showing the constitution the process\nAnd the whole process of a role of what it means to give advice and consent\n", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "05"}
