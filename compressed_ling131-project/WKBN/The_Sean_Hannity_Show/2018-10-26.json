packaging whatever the case may be um and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre I'd say because way over the top I think\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left in they'd send cameras following you for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they get two ruptured and said that ran it was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name um but then he got on and\nHe went on this ten minute tirade against the president you know I didn't have any objection to be an on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I

Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and matches or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people ... down on my actions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nKnow I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia\nYeah because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck

Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and uh uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nAre no other stories or you know kind of take the lead\nNow but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about Republicans are doing\nIf if we in two weeks to have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and west\nVirginia being and plays huge if we can hold onto the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to happen by the way pre existing conditions the big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with preexisting conditions nobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a pre existing condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've\nBeen able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there on the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a vacation\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance

even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate

the face I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House\nSevered heads of President Trump and of course threat after threat after threat after threatened with media never got all worked up in their lives uh when it's a Republican look here's here's just they truth that they will never tell\nThey care about only Donald Trump Russia collusion with all the evidence that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nRussian lies disseminated them to you we the people in the lead up to the election that those Russian paid for lives of Hillary were used as the bulk of information presented to you know for by the court judges\nThat the that predicated the entire Russia which ... which was the bony bought and paid dot CA of Hillary Clinton from with Russian lives they only care they only care if it's Trump Russia\nThey don't care about anything else you know if you look at the cabinet situation\nOh cabinet we needed an FBI investigation these allegations are horrible\nNone of those people that demanded an FBI investigation into nearly forty year old allegations some of them so far fetched from reality they never once demanded an FBI investigation into Keith Ellison\nAnd this is in within the last year with evidence\nWith tapes with text messages with doctors reports or nobody that was demanding the cabinet treatment for cabinet ever demanded of for Ellison\nOr the recent report over the weekend about Cory Spartacus Booker\nOr kicked Claire McCaskill's husband and allegations made against him or when he was married to his first wife I mean if that's the standard none of them asked for the Clintons to have this Bill Clinton to go through the same thing the judge Kavanaugh went through they praise him to the hilt\nAnd we've got the same thing here I could literally spend an hour on this program playing the incendiary violence statements of those on the left that the media routinely ignored\nAnd the hatred all ... the minute by minute second by second hour after hour day after day Trump hatred twenty four seven which is now that it's a it's it's a psychotic pathology on the part of those in the news media they didn't care about that either\nFree so he set an eight hundred troops down there and there's even debates\nAbout all of that kind of stuff and it'll be politicized as well when what the president's trying to do is enforced borders and\nThe law if you will when it comes to immigration so you would think would be able to reach common ground that some of this stuff doesn't seem to be the case anymore these days\nAnd the president's even saying at this point in time hey these people that are common turnaround ... we're not going to let you and they were bringing the troops out you know he's basically saying to him\nOr don't waste your time march and all this way or coming all his way turn around and go back and ultimately has said the Guatemala as well as Mexico we're going to cut your foreign aid\nI bet you were surprised that were given a foreign aid we're going to cut your foreign aid substantially because it doesn't appear to us that you're doing very much when it comes to these particular situation so\nWe shall see better busy weekend plenty to

with Hillary Clinton um and she was one of the people that was targeted by by all of this but other postings\nYou know um if you look at a that\nThey don't seem to express admiration for Trump's politics so you got the other side of this you know crediting Trump on the one hand would strategies with helping him open up a sports bar you know why he would put that up there in any way that seems a little odd and weird and\nUh but I think what we're dealing with somebody with a great instability\nIs one is from MSNBC is Andrea Mitchell a promise to repay your door apply to Europe threats\nYou know we will answering coming to see you soon and uh with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God\nAnd um\nWe uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA trail led to this Florida Man at his fingerprints on some of these bombs that basically there are small PVC bombs and\nFrom what we can determine they all had powder in them some type of electric some type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nIn that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country [noise] we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs for sensitive areas individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nPay small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise]\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI law based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters [noise]\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and an Hollywood but to see it up close and reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work [noise] I also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counter terrorism division\nWho remain on high alert every to try to keep the American people safe from harm and who moved quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now [noise] and other packages [noise] so we need the help\nOf everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us our tip line at one eight hundred call FBI for our email line tips the FBI dot Gov [noise]\nNo piece of information is too small every sim could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nAbout protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through all the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and\nBernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it do they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans\nIs our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker is you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um\nThere's this idiot on fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nRestaurant had and he says had a direct language ... may have we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage in big echo an amplified by Fox News and other folks and the conservative jets yeah but it's not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blasting deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes from a Robert Deniro I was calling the president devil and us devil worshippers in effect you know\nI'm used to play the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the tissue to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been miserable\nLenient lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly [noise] stupid he's a\nHunk his dog he's a big he's a con artist mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool this Bozo has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald\nTrump [noise] I'm On\nWhat are we talking about [noise] idiot as the president [laughter]\nZero long eight hundred ... you're not going to get it this is a double standard in the media you get conservatives who say you\nCan't hold Bernie Sanders responsible because one of his ... supporters went out there and shot but it's there there is an obsession to always blamed conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases in that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey've gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they're in love with the Clintons there nobody that's Keith Ellison or Cory Booker it's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the rhetoric doesn't come down as the me the most part CNN and networks\nHave been silent when Republicans are confronted everywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nWe're we're going up all night vision guys for drunk with an alternative\nIf you've ever been curious
