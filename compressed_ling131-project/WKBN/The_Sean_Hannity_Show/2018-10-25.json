C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw laws producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would in in I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices and and they got them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie well when you get an eight to stuff or you know you blow to pieces\nGets harder to collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs took a machine right so now you have a package it's so uh the mail or the the stamps were writing the device ... side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages ... who's a this is a benefit to the law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like ... okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head they're first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one set devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation incentivize as violence on public officials and anyone who does\nUm is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically of strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually developed\nA new kind of a you know let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs to get it was very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed the John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's not hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out that John Brennan and then you don't NBC comedies not to CNN 'cause sure this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were ... enough of its Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and you\nKnow I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you out a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow\nA like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false

hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and\nWe and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down and when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to move the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is to have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and nearing it may I suggest have integrity\nIs about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they can only make one choice one\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone none at it it it her way back to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting\nAnd it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nThen how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to miss represent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these

them feel uncomfortable that conflict got a cop call nine one one or ... toll free kind of terrorism number which is one eight eight eight\nNew York city safe and that's where anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as they do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we'd do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty\nThat we will

when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public we serve safe that's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe\nAnd through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in
