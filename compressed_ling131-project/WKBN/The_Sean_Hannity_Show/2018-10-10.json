J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context for people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... leads to page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media league strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd they got rid of all it was was the ... recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there was one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI directors that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... just after market may they still have anywhere from ... uh proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that rose to see a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with ... with you I'm sure record talk about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have to eating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas only ... well at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThat says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jerry why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nRight and in fact I interviewed former top officials that the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeter Struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing their power in the law to remove a ...\nWe got so much more to get to we're going to hold over ... ...\nAnd John Solomon into the next out one other thing that we've got to get to an all of this we have now other revelations that have come out with everything that's been going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat the FBI making it more clear now than ever before that Hillary Clinton really through what is just she's up toward eyeballs and everything being the sole instigator of the entire Russia gate scandal that only paying for the dot CA\nAnd there was a great piece by John Solomon last week and investors business daily also laying out all the evidence\nA chilling indictment of how this political criminal\nNot only managed to escape indictment but was somehow able to weaponize the FBI and the D.

storm that the ... and handle has ever seen\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says he's asked for a major disaster declaration as heat employees on NASA will have a response in the wake of the killer storms\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge these destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher\nUm over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is gonna be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make their preparations now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein others has really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth buys a application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money\nIt was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just\nLearned this you know this week James Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony\nBecause lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a\nTranscribe interview and that the interview be under oath he's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nDon't want to be under oath at all now the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oh did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about what wouldn't regards to ... warrants that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first it gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there are there\nBut anyway then they started ... media leaks strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nA judiciary committee's outside the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why ... especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a raft musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona Mick Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri in favor of the Republican candidates a lot of movement Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble in North Dakota Joe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana\nWe've got all the spy few stocks you can handle immigrations\nA hot issue this is great that we're seeing the screen or action there and watch a lot of what the left and they want to say that they\nDon't agree with you should really agree with everything\nYou said all day every day I\nUse radio five Seventy WKBD [noise] voted to find pretty simply Michael\nIs the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen governor Rick

inland now thirty to forty miles and we want to give you said at the track of this is going to be very uh right through middle Georgia\nOr they're very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south of the track for instance it looks like wind gusts are going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between\nA sixty and eighty miles an hour near and

six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me throw this a little bit more first of all I mean the the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody stayed than people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these images and it's it's downright scary flooding has already occurred in in some of these coastal areas\nUm but the the these are the types of wins that could blow down houses correct and and structure\nI suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made
