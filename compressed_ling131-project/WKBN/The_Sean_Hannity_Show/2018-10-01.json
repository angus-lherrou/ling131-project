[noise]\nABC News\nOntario all they are responding to pressure from Democrats and moderate Republicans the White House says now ease limitations on the FBI background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sources tell ABC News the FBI can interview anyone at once with a focus on sexual misconduct claims entrapped\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go\nBut that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people\nIn an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person was first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them hold some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself\nNow that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them last week 'cause they they they they all have the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh on and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that did not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this first six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman\nThat had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh and then of course we had the original hearings and not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is the lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week\nOf a friend of this attorney for professor Ford this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nA professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein and they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety\nAnd this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed ever cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by ... cabin on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F a warnings in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at under the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they're all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat I witnessed it said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident\nSo I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements and ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come out please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yet who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank\nYou know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out that's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he we know we had to a blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal you\nKnow everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he was a pollster was the Clintons poster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away I Want you to think about\nSix days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six test the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have the getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels and you got to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds\nGive up the good work for the Trump rebounded talking about it right here on
