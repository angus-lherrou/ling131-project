you caveat\nI'm hearing all the Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh has been sworn in again\nAnd we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCain\nMemos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting a immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually prove a I think that can be a a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week\nWe aren't going to issue a subpoena\nTo the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah the ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things\nAll right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that in the middle of all of this and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow view getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened there ... there\nWe have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain those ... obtain these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence CIA up guys absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any\nInternational relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but\nI again I'm happy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah but what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food and does have a network\nOf of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't out\nThat well in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that\nThe Russians did versus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post\nAbout these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a Democrat hired operatives\nWorking in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this and first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a war against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report a I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't\nWith I think first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there's a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but there\nAgain because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously\nYou've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\n... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right by the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to the ... about that that they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior\nThere is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using ... verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and\nThe road block that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so my the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time\nBasically yeah and you know going back many years again and we had talked about\nMany hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours you think you spent total\nThe last two years out of the last two decades two years as two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight out\nA hot issue this is great that where the screen or action there's always going to be off\nMatter what the left and they want to say that they\nDon't agree with you should always really agree with everything you\nSaid all day every day I\nUse radio five Seventy WKBD [noise] blaring in at the White House nice report\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh acknowledged his confirmation process was contentious and emotional\nI take this office with gratitude and no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability and unity my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans\nThat insurance apologize to have it on his family for the partisan fight over his nomination candlelight vigil is underway in Amsterdam New York for the twenty people who were killed in Saturday's limit crash hurricane Michael gaining strength\nAnd speed in the Gulf of Mexico fields for hurricane Michael ...\nIn Mexico is a relatively intense storm they just wait for\nSo the goal on a collision course with the U.S coastline some coastal flooding already along Alabama speeches Michael out or bans reading he went hey this is Victor\nKendall Michael is expected to hit Florida Wednesday as a cap three hurricane ... holding your ABC News [noise]\nNext Sunday that ten just ahead more stimulating talk from the old Charlie's digital studios nine Ninety nine menu nine great meals one great price oh Charlie's [noise]\nMoscow bally's great Russian cracker twenty six anniversary is performing and young south described [noise]\nFamily a gift that will last a lifetime\nExperience world famous Russian dance with a Broadway style pitcher healed in the press and the number one Christmas experience for children of all ages [noise] celebrate the season not ...\nAppearing at Edward W powers on December [noise]\nOr your home or business called math a heating and cooling ... your factory authorized Bryant's dealer now this storm team twenty seven forecasts [noise]\nWarm temperature is not only this evening but sticking around overnight mostly ... or have temperatures slipping in the mid to upper sixties when you're starting twenty seven forecast son meteorologist Paul what's\nCurrently Seventy two\nFive Seventy W.

[noise]\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one smears slander priest merge meant blood thinning whoever they don't like and don't agree with it's nothing new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program but the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders\nEliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else did they stay on for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot are new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation these kept his promise on building the wall hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduce the bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to fund the wall in our\nRecord unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series\nThat's how far back that goes Hispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to presidents kept\nHis promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the\nKeystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it out the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage have all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally ... do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter ... one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was that if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remembered than all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwaiti\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThen went out and hire the former ... six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel\nFor the FBI now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators at an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's stunning in terms of what it reveals since uh directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nIt was chronicled by both the deputy director Andrew McCabe ... and his lawyer Lisa Page That's Peter strokes boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official\nA girlfriend rather sorry\nPage was it was she was his boyfriend he was her she was his girlfriend\nAlright enough you're interrupting me anyway went\nTo the office of a third FBI official general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said so now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump\nAfter Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it\nThe thing that struck me the most was the serious look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of of bakers house interview he was saying that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously because he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it\nWhich now I Know the president met yesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one statement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving this thing [noise]\n\nFor named Don rattlesnake [laughter] compared\nTo ... people are want this swamp being dream and I don't know if there is a way\nTo a great thing to have somebody White House saying by here in America has no compromise for either people\nGive up the good work President Trump he rebounded talking about it right here besides Seventy W category agree one hundred twenty mile\nAn hour winds Florida governor Rick Scott says hurricane Michael making up the line for his state's panhandle means business the national Hurricane Center is forecasting storm surge\nThing about this eight to twelve feet\nOf storm surge about two
