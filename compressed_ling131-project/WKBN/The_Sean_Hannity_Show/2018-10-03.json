success with your book really outstanding you\nAll right let me such get into this issue now I asked Lindsey Graham last night and we'll start with you David I said well what if you fall one vote short\nBecause now the the Democrats and the senator from Hawaii the once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigate a nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated\nIn every case there's no ... operation\nAt all none and and multiple changes in stories at least\nTwo of the three cases and yet this this goes on and the lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweat Nick was claiming and now she has backtracked\nI don't even know why NBC whatever running interview like this but they did run it\nEven saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backed tracks on his story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously radon them in one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\nI Am ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nUh these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand up and defend themselves and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his is to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would hate to have that kind of\nIn the sky and how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapist who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to\nGo there is and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete an aunt\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're Regis leaves wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and it someplace sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nWell they have gotten a ... and contrast that with his response on the mark on the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a match or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nTo everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of cabinet but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit a in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again the statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead ...\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do\nUh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true\nBut in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term hits the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that\nNothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing either way and the people know that what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious\nAnd I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss in them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for it's fighting and ultimately winning and\nElections do have consequences and whether it's a red way out Republicans\nDemocrats have a shot and taking the outback\nAnd writing and\nDon't trust them but I'm Glad to the mid term election ... get out there in both\nHere about it's talking about it\nI just don't trust the election on five studies double duty and now we're hearing there is

thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA one on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least we can see what I think was the parent to a lot of people are just there was nothing to this story [noise]\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already gotten it's damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they want to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of this agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and Mr ... and the fall and incredibly\nLead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and saved has changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... or your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants to men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway as senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the midterms in and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nWe're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats or rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump s ride they've already against Gorsuch\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listed as viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have allied salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a ... I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled are good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen\nAnd Washington and that's saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we call a vote short a left take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nMe ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this what the seriousness the charge deserves\nI think ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about capital\nBut ... this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it as the homophobic Xena ...

about that I understand why people are angry because\nI'm angry we've now watch this sixteen days circus go on\nAnd now you've got the Democrats who never had any intention of oh we want we want to do

you lose and drugs and these these young boys lined up and well I saw him in the hall I don't know if he was one I saw him in the hall\nYou're saying it happened on a ... a almost a weekly basis\nThat that boys were drugging girls and gang raping the and that it went on for a long time and then you change the story at what point does is there any shame left among people I understand the importance of the Supreme Court\nIf you want to be able to pick Supreme Court nominees you've got to win elections this is why thirty five days from now matters so much criticism Columbia Chris welcome to the program\nMr ... thanks\nUm I just wanted to say that as a former police officer I listened to this horse testimony and there were a couple of things that I found to cause some credibility issues with her statements I'm\nFirst that her friend failed to notice that if you don't want to the girl to gathering disappeared and she never to this day followed up on it and secondly at the grocery store too much later she runs into\nOur attack or one of her attackers recollection is is that she tried to get out of sight feeling ill\nIt's that she engaged him in conversation with high\nAnd she remembers how he look\nLook it there there's so much wrong with the in terms of if you're going to name people\nAnd you're going to say they were at these the ... at at where crimes were committed\nAnd attacks took place and those people do not corroborate your story now we're going back thirty six years I understand some people's memories but they're adamantly denying it and I witnessed one eye witness\nIs siding with Brett Kavanaugh others never ever ever happen her girl girlfriend says I don't ever remember being at any such party when you're going to make serious allegations like this you can't have groups of people that are supposed to be lawmakers\nThat are rooted in laws are rooted in truth\nProcess due process constitutional law presumption of innocence all declaring they believe even before people were heard you cannot have because if that's now the standard you're guilty\nBy accusation you argue anybody can make any accusation\nAnd I believe the accusation we have no rule of law at that point throughout the whole process nobody\nAnd I have watched this process now one fold was Richard jewel Duke lacrosse Ferguson, Missouri Cambridge police or Baltimore, Maryland Trayvon and George Zimmerman everybody thinks they know\nAnd they all ended up being wrong because they rush to judgment\nWest Virginia [laughter] but we know that we kind of knew that but you're kind of felt you should've beat butler yeah and ah and we were expected to uh\nBuy thirty five points if you're a gambling man so I I think the biggest thing is and you're seeing some strides offensive lemons and got her head over four hundred yards I think there's less mistakes happening offensively\nA part of I think are often so problem was had a highway lined you know when we needed to yards you kinda need a full back or a tight end\nAnd trying to get that off and it's kind of put in 'em over time I think is getting better and the mistakes even talking to the coaches this week the mistakes offensively are getting less and less\nStill a couple of mistakes on first down where we start out you know two three are law so that second I'm Thirteen but offensively we're making strides defensively I think we've gone backwards over the last three weeks and ball has tried new players this week\nAnd physically they're tough physically they can tackle physically in practice they're doing what they should be doing\nAnd then they're getting into games and Boeing I flew home together from a McCollum Illinois a Saturday Night and it's like that I I just don't know what to do they're doing things in practice they're answering things correctly and then you're going to get into a game and it's tough\nA historically and I've been involved in some teams like that\nUm what's that normally says and I talked to the coaches that way is that they're not they're not allowing those kids for whatever reason and the ... you know you have two major injuries that safety early in the year round that you have two new guys are there and you have a new cornerback was there um\nWhen you're thinking when you're on the football field and think about whatever sport you play if you have to think about it on game day you're going to lose stink\nAbout your swing if you're a golfer if you're thinking about what you're going to end up not keeping your head down probably not going to happen and I I think what's happened is that\nThese great athletic defensive players are thinking too much and it was kinda funny 'cause a coach dress or president address on our on a a\nA a webcast or whatever you call those uh with ... son called the rivalry and a had a chance to talk to him after the fact and he he shared a story with me the Ohio State\nI'm In one of his early years was having a tough year they were six and four going into the Michigan Ohio State game and they just came off a bad defensive performance and coached Antonio who's now the head coach of Michigan State was his defensive coordinator\nAnd coach stressful at the time goes down to\nCoach the Antonio's office and says you you could you could run whatever you want in whatever scheme you want in the defense of backfield coverage wise but you're only allowed to pick one of each\nThe Antonio so this was the biggest game of the year is crazy ... will be OK he says no you could pick whatever you want but it's one on one\nAnd President Trump has said the Ohio State had their greatest defensive game of the year coming off of their worst because the kids were flying around the field not thinking they were reacting and be an athlete so I think you're going to see a little bit of simplification this week the athleticism is there\nBut you know there is no week off anymore maybe in the states a week off I mean these teams I mean who the heck goes to the west in Illinois wherever the hell we were last week but the athletes on that team there is no week offer on so I mean although they might be in the ... they made the playoffs last year they might not be a North Dakota state or South Dakota state\nThere is no week off so if you show up they're not playing defense\nYou know I don't care how many points you score you're going to lose the\nGame ... holding up I think it's tough for him I mean ...\nYou know from his standpoint he is a winner and uh he is he is probably the greatest defense of mind in America right now coach you I mean when you see I was out one Bobby stoops a\nHad a statue dedicated in his honor both ... with us and when you see the defense of coaches including Mike Stoops kind of get in front of a bow and ask him ... this is not bow asking the Oklahoma people questions is is ... you know bogus national about schemes and this and that and\nUm it's gotta be tremendously frustrating because I think he's a he's done a great job being a head coach I think he's learned a lot through the years and the players love him and he knows football it's just sometimes maybe you get ahead of\nIt a little bit and it was in a year or Henri lost his brother is a former later and hang on just on the electric going in that faith in\nBack [noise]\n\n[laughter] start teams only seven forecast rented by ... tonight sixty seven to ... percent chance of thunderstorms in Seventy two and right now we're at Seventy four ah with the south towards a medical shows just hogging at Moran ski on it and talk to you about\n... we were just talking for a few minutes about why issue what do you think about President Trump's all I mean I think it was great that he said this University He didn't stay at the University of Akron look at the mess they're in and look at all he's doing here as a person as a coach as a as a president university\nI I think he's doing as great a job\nAs any precedent that in a University in the United states of America I think are so much of what some of us saw coming in and get a lot of people looking at that same what's a football coach ... president university has to come from Africa academia you know from his standpoint he is respected and he knows what he doesn't know\nSo every good CEO knows what they know and they know what they don't know\nAnd although he's educated himself more on the academic side of things he's surrounded himself with great people he's in the middle of of raising over a hundred million dollars on this campaign if you go down there Ron everything is under construction and\nUm you know there's more kids that are looking into why issue and it's now kind of in vogue because it's\nIt's such a it's always been a quality institution but it's always\nYou know anyone could get in there now their standards\nAnd if you take a look at the whole package and the man that he is and the amount of hours he puts in representing Youngstown State I mean I Hope I Wish you could say it's one of one of the things that has to succeed locally for all of us to\nTo live a better life here Youngstown State university and uh I I could not be any prouder of saying that he is our president and and more proud just to call them a friend\nOf mine I'm forgetting China that after Youngstown State where did he go to be a coach after that what was a school called\nI I don't recall [laughter] that's a part of the you know he he does on various\nBut whether or not because we love Xiong Xiong long\nTime to not get the Michigan you know it's not been the same Ron sense of we talk about that yesterday to like to have a robbery Michigan has to win the game every once in a while this was not this is not even funny I mean\nWell what about the brown Steelers yeah thing right I mean in Iraq\nWe right but the the ... the brownies or looking a little bit better we got we got to your chance to be in Cleveland last light of the concert and or\nOr or or new quarterback was introduced as the mayor of Cleveland and he really is he's the real deal I Know Barbies stoops loved him\nWhen he was up to Oklahoma but I think there's a there should be a lot of them at one of those crazy people I grew up being a browns fan and I met John ... who introduced me to the steel courting them I kinda like both I'm a I'm a weirdo I got up in Youngstown ever meet LeBron ...\nOkay just Chuck it All right well maybe that to happen one of these days gives you something to think about\nThat you had Moran ski and to schedule your mammogram today the south which Center for breast health located inside south towards imaging at Seventy six twenty three market street in boardman offers convenient early morning evening and Saturday hours to schedule your mammogram call three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred\nThree three zero nine six five fifty one hundred\nIt can save your life is genuinely can three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred if you haven't had one call so Ford's schedule your\nMammogram three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred [noise]\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegation\nAnd I want to get into what this whole means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that\nObviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course\nThey were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nOf covering the cabinet case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this\nI think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim\nFrom this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up a story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's\nSaying well well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in Brett Kavanaugh I saw him near the punch bowl and he was giving out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in\nCollege he police documents that show\nThat Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nWhy we need and has the end of the nation because there\nA lot of allegations and I mean for its really are about how he behaves finance drug [noise]\nAll right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel\nAnd ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIf further claimed the Ford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly I've been no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said they were for people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen\nSo at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to asked the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to\nA lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I I mean professor Ford has now told their story multiple times and\nI've got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise]\nUm you know it's just I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness\nA topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way of solving a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office apparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're going to have to start kicking people out of the ... of these\nSenate buildings income congressional offices because I'm going to somebody's gonna get hurt\n'em and I'm all for free speech but you ought to be able to walk out your door and not get surrounded by groups of people screaming at you if you represent in the country Mitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control\nYou know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and so we'll see what that means from his vantage points uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done\nFord complaining the FBI never contacted her but they have a story what else did they need\nThat needs to be exposed about about some fundamental core values and principles that one party or abandoning ... you know we're now entering really dangerous territory if it's guilt by accusation from thirty six years ago\nAnd what it means and how it ties into what power you we the people have thirty four days from now\nNow again there are two scenarios you're going to tune in that night which one do you want you get to choose\nIf you're angry about what's happening\nIf you like the dramatic shift in the economy if like the record setting unemployment numbers if you liked the fact that\nActual stuff is getting done at a at an unbelievable taste especially considering this is Washington you know it takes them an hour and thirty minutes to just think about brushing their teeth it's they don't move\nAnd now you've got the president literally altering shifting changing the way things have been done these breaking a lot of dishes and he's a disruptor and he's iconoclastic and he fights but when he fights against you know even allies negotiating trade deals we're benefiting\nAnd the forgotten men and women the people that matter the most two years ago they're all benefiting\nAnd I notice now Trump's lawyers say the allegations of fraud tax evasion they're now trying to dig up tax returns from the father how when did Donald Trump's father die\nWas it two decades ago at least maybe more\nAnd it's just that but I guess they figure the Kavanaugh issue is done and the Senate's going to vote whichever way they're going to vote so now we got to move on to a new scandal\nAnd we can't exactly moved to stormy ... books than out so maybe we'll do Russia again that doesn't work we'll do taxes again maybe we'll have a big reveal on Rachel Maddow after forty minutes leading I gotta eat

and the Senate planning their vote and moving forward on all of this um the big question in with all the news today\nYou know what do we see happening as in the next thirty four days what do we see happening\nYou know five weeks from yesterday you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will chair her committee impeach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know it's if you go back forty nine
