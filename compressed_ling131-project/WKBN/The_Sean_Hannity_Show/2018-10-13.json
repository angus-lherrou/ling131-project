sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and an FBI building so I think cinemas going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha ... he was a rock star a person that has served our country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and whether or not a this is gonna be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over redux a we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shown is with us welcome both the back to the program\nThank you thank you thank you\nI I don't think there's any doubt the Kavanaugh overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence has now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I think I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you noticed the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations of businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you've got and take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country so these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically just stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat hip hop on this not me and eloquent us stem cells are streaming service or write to\nMe it was so that they are because that's who they are they the conservative so those that it's not because\nIt's simple no one is Hans within a size life oh no one can\nA I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I Know I'm a libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhenever office would like\nTo run for I think my friend John and I can\n... ... ... ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I say look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid or because he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash\nBut but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be garden governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next feature she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just fighting is a frightening Republican Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely onto should go period style absolutely and and\nDoes point about in previous times are have been on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again once the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\n[noise]\nOn them guys for van on\nLay down the upcoming days of the\nNight watchman join us on this but I worked for radio affiliate are on line in more than\nGuy more Smith Saturday mornings\nAnd mine Youngstown Warren license on five Seventy doubled you may be in\nPrison looking into what happened to a journalist who vanished after entering Saudi Arabia's embassy in Turkey\nDespite turkey saying it has visual and audio evidence that Saudi officials murdered Washington Post journalist ...

year out their national contender ranked second right now and\nYou mentioned the run game Bob and watching them a little bit this week on film I'm impressed with their run game at times I Am with their dynamic passing attack there for backs food they can use Isaac Wallace lead the charge over nine yards a carrier which is second in the country by mighty Daniel you have\nAlso Pierre strong and a couple of other backs who can really carry the ball you know they do such a good job complementing the run with the past you know there are tremendous off the play action off his own read or they can really do a lot of things to hit you with some ... so you know as much as we talk about the passing game Youngstown State is going to have to be a very focused on containing the\nRun game today to

in Missouri Valley conference crew and hopefully we won't get as much airtime led by David cigarettes they did last week against southern Illinois\nA couple of other thoughts about this year is that this has been a series were physically or South Dakota state as last year we dominated the but they physically have taken it to ... noted he thought during his time South Dakota state manhandled us a little more than North Dakota state so we can't let that happen today you mentioned there ...\nThere was a recent Christians but healthy there's a reason I have a good back they will go up and said

court will take a break it's a Jack rabbits on their way to the wind on five Seventy W ... football fans and now\nIn the game as this point become a little secondary continues to lay on his back\nMedical staff is out there with the car [noise] and uh\nPrayers and thoughts are with Christian Randall poses because this looks like a very very serious injury at this point have\nShoulder pads off in ... there and this is the part of football that\nNo one wants to see he played so well last week at a career high eleven tackles against southern Illinois and has been a key part of this defense versatile linebacker who can cover and played around and see athletic director Ron stroller going out as well yeah there there's there's multiple medical staff working on him I should say that Isaac Wallace who\nLeft this game earlier with a serious injuries back on the sidelines for South Dakota state good to see so it's good to see him back but this has been going on probably ten minutes now\nChristian Randall Posey are linebacker who's a junior from Pittsburgh [noise] ah whereas number thirty five\nDown on the field let's go to Mike just ask you Mike or you hate to see this yeah\nI Know you guys obsolete you study so now you're you know thoughts and first was Christian and his family is something you never want to see in football but\nNow as you said they're putting them on the on the board right now and [noise]\nYou know I've seen him move his legs legs were up in like in is bent and the the straighten them out so that's obviously a good sign but so what these injuries like this you want to be extremely cautious as you know they took off his face mask with the with the screwdriver and and you know haven't removed his helmet\nSo as you said you just football become secondary in these injuries and our thoughts and prayers are with Christian right now it\nDoes look like they're working on the next and had an area\nRight wing you know in a lot of these situations you hope that I Know a lot of times are overly cautious obviously when you're dealing with the head or the neck to you try and just be careful and be cautious the you know\nAnd hopefully that's the case it maybe it's not as bad but they're just trying to to be careful with it and [noise]\nYou know and that's why you've seen the shift in football and the focus on targeting and and some of these penalties to try and take away it's to their head because we all we know how ... can be and\nWhat we saw a couple of last week there were scary as well ed demolished Joyner and kick off with the Jay Davis [noise]\nI'm Still amazed a DJ Davis got up after that kickoff return when he got hit last week so exactly if it's a violent game and\nIt's you hate to see these type of things but [noise] what comes along with it unfortunately\nThey're still working on him a down on the field\nAnd or cut up on a commercial breaks will keep it right here and uh [noise]\nWas about as long as I've seen a player down with an injury and a long long time [noise]\nAnd he's a young man who have been a special teams you know special if the last few years really was a big part of that team finally getting a chance this year to step up and play a more\nDeveloped linebacker role and [noise]\nAnd we're already down a couple a couple of spots on the ... with an injury so it's just been that type of year and is losing key players in [noise]\nOur scores thirty six to seven penguins lead this game a one time a seven six\nAnd it's been all South Dakota state since then\nAnd looks like they're they're they're the carts been moved okay into a different position right now\nAs they go over the medical staff um\nBoth teams continue to work on Christian around the ... on on the field of both seen a doctor who came here today and led by Dr Jay Jay's the fence and continue to work on Randall posing as well [noise]\nYou know it was so thankful for for those doctors and you don't think people realize how serious of a situation it is to be the person who's running out to someone like that now they have him on the cart and even the south Dakota state players all of the offensive players are going over [noise]\nWe're we're wishing absolute best thoughts and prayers back home as well placed for Christian Randall ... to leave this game on a cart\nNew most certainly think you'll be taken to a local hospital\nThirty six seven Jack rabbits leads five Eighteen to play in the for all the penguins are the majority of them anyway are coming out [noise] for which there to\nMake the best as he has taken off the field [noise]\nHe's a great young man and we have so many good kids on his team and do you have something where we get so caught up in the wins and losses in the stats of course but of course he has a group of tremendous young men on his team who do great work in the community and very representatives of the university so I Christians one of them and he's a great kid to to mingle with and see you in the hallways and\nAgain we're wishing him the best that they take the card off [noise]\nSo he will leave the field with much of the medical staff on the party with him it will be very cautious see waves does waivers handouts [noise]\n\nAnd actually this proud really on its feet cheering for\nThe most to lose that feels\nGreat to see him give the thumbs up and [noise] always good to see that\nThat's a good sign that he was able to raise his arms raised his hand up to the fans here thirty six seven five Eighteen to play jak sad the football second down and five five Eighteen remaining [noise] will resume flies once that card is off the field\nAnd I'm Amazed five minutes to go thirty six seven I Would not have the courage and on the field if I don't know I I agree it's a
