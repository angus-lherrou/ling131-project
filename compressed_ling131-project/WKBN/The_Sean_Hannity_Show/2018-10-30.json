we're letting getting to know a lot more about Robert\nBowers and who he is he was a very ill an anti Semite he was a huge critic of Donald Trump\nOr in a lot of ways um and the president you know took heat for saying what that means maybe and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings\nWhere the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dumber the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long front of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I loved by friends in Pittsburgh rose a very very sorry or thoughts and prayers go to everybody on the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes me my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is sunny or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning\nI mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear the list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood\nI go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me it just about a month ago that's one of the the ... is considering moving too so we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very

brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is starting to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds there's an interesting side note that there is no throw this to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turned against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we have had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nThat any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body is that of their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a

have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with ... shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him he tell us and joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic Cade he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism and any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as is part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson of Bill Clinton were all sitting next to

and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying to make it to the southern border the United states and the president\nAnd the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership and Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries\nFrom South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the

serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is is you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the\nPresident who basically tried to uh over the constitutional make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan and leave out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the mark\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist is in effect the giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad in our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws\nAre constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us ... seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws humbling according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered by the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border\nWhy is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and\nThat our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here uh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent we don't want to vote for and also it has undoubtedly true that most\nThese people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff on the look probably been lied to the beginning I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nSo they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply we as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible raunchy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and\nI've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nSo when North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia leans Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten that's that's where my head is that today and\nI'm ... I'm trying to warn people that this is real that you know hit we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results on the morning after the night before\nAnd it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that's you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer already Frank with you I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with a third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go full for the gusto and when it all one of the big problems for the Republicans as they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house and\nTo really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman it just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean are toll free

I approve this message [noise]\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour or there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look at real clear politics they have they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey got that they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I did go up pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even type forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santa's is coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his the leaders stabbing now in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprised not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say this shot first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple what we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got British sent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee you got reticence that calling the people Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there\nSaying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely\nOut of touch they can see pass or angry is Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there one of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back\nIncrease to regulate its watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nOr two years starting point are just as the top of
