I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in the process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society\nOr even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade in precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of the seriousness and sobriety\nTo the entire debate I just I I\nI don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney gray Jarrett\nBox those legal analyst author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was done that I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Holland's condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there there were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present that\nThat was very little probably the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a serious response from the Republicans and I'm often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this did a grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you are now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion\nAnd Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday or that the that\nJudge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each wrote some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know the student to Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that same vein you're absolutely right what she said was critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost and all of this also critically important that you emphasize the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this that they were all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegations man or woman has built up a career is guilty so important for that um\nI worry still I have to say is that where we go from here because we have seen behavior by United States senators and has been going on the scale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive dreams couldn't imagine with hospitable people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh who ... carved out of the nation you were a bad guy where black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale is the future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make um this is\nThe very same people who are land that the president for daring to criticize crooked FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera\nThose people for whom stroke was a hero or now criticizing the FBI this wasn't a fair a thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like the meter because it took it personally when\nIt 'cause I don't know they don't like his temperament I was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe but uh it\nLooks like this goes forward it looks like Kavanaugh has the votes that will support his nomination and that this will conclude tomorrow barring any unforeseen last minute you know insanity but I Will tell you we one issue we've got to deal with and I'm

be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was bought full it was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on

bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhat really realize today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through her decision making process and frankly it was flawless it was spectacular\nNothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was obvious\nShe missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this\nProcess did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they've

learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in

to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last Eighteen days political is down to the island socks\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never habits are the best thing you can do to stop this in the future is deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad if what it says and say\nListen I you know I went to the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very

will do to get power and that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government [noise]\n[noise] well I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I'd never known Susan Collins that well I Know that look\nLook the Republican Party is not a model out for dinner if you want to and I'd love to I actually\nI I Am buddy today that\nI had no idea that the federal ... under which she makes her decisions and I I ... back time I respect I ... I really have a deep respect I Want everybody to have their own mind I'm not even a Republican I'm a conservative for reasons that I hold passionate dear\nBut you mentioned something earlier that this was a profile in courage for her right in as much as we you've been outside in the halls in the Senate and you see what's going on there and all the protesting\nAnd Maine is not exactly an a an expensive media market and I know they've been spending millions of dollars in Maine to try and\nInfluence or and groups are pledging now to to vote her out of office and destroying her and I'm like that anybody listen to what\nSenator calls just said that anybody want to listen I don't think anybody wanted to hear what she said because it was the single most thorough\nCase for for\nHow any senator or congressman should make any of that we stood on core principles a presumption of innocence it was beyond the ... to me let me let me ask you this\nUm tell us about medicine mentioned say yes to\nWell mansions ESL light Joe and um you know he was a yes but Susan was the center of the storm and I'll say something about like we've had our differences I Know the president's had their differences but Jeff Flake also is that yes\nJeff Flake or is on the other side of a lot of things with Trump but he rose to the occasion and say listen\nI Want to hear more but I'm inclined to believe what I Believe\nI Want to hear from Dr Ford he listened to you also listen to Kavanaugh and the process her and Susan and Susan ... is gonna make Kevin ... a better now I'm In a more

N. N. G. that's the furthest that they're going to lie to go back on these radios\nAre but so even if you're in and I'm telling you if you buy a router that has a acts and you don't have any devices that have a an adapter for a acts you're not going to be able to benefit from it so don't even do that\nUm I think most of the devices with the uh the phones and whatnot we've got pretty good radios in them and they'll be able to take advantage of up to a see is what I'm what I'm guessing as most of the time if you got a good wireless and now you've got it\nBut those two things are going to watch on the horizon is a this year comes to a close this quarter comes to a close those are two things I'm excited about unbreakable glass that you can ... I don't necessarily think I'm going to bend my phone around but at least\nOf the screen on crack on me and a wireless that we can start playing with it has some pretty in my mid the excitement comes from if you got wireless looking transmitted three point six\nYou know ... bits per second I can create wireless bridges between buildings that can transmit just as fast as a wire can transmit between those two buildings how you might I might not give you access to connect to America it's a function where we don't have to run wireless through conduit we can just broadcast it out\nAnd you'll never know that you're on a segment of the network that got connected to another network using wireless so that's exciting from my side\nWe're attacked we take this break come back take more of your phone calls you're listening to the young son computer show on five Seventy WPN we'll be back\n[noise]\n\nAlright well come back everybody this is the young south computer show a text message says a in a race to create the finish ... latest phone why wouldn't these companies at a little bit of weight for a stronger screen I Believe it's controlled\nA obsolete in in an effort to make money\nAnd I will agree with you a hundred percent and it's only in that you know in in that competition where these people are are kept in check as long as we have lots of companies that are vying for position then there's always going to be somebody to like it the price or hit hit the advancement or something\nOr with the force is necessary to change the environment 'cause we get all get super board when are these thousand dollar phones I mean do you do any of us really think\nThat these things should costs a thousand dollars could they be made cheaper with the same amount of\nUh of technology I mean I I don't know maybe they are just that awesome um\nBut I you know when it comes to a couple of the features that barely change over time I mean what are these engineering engineers doing it or they just beyond the peak of what our technology can do and it just recycling and you know\nAre taking a different you know put the camera in a different position give it another mega pixel and really use it as a brand new thing that kind of thing does this cycles us you know those are advancement cycles ... them to make your old one obsolete I I I almost by into just a little bit\nUh so thanks for the text message I appreciate it and I will mentioned again if you're interested in taking the workshop that Matthew ... Cho is thrown out there he's going to have two sessions in the morning not twelve\nAnd also six to eight in the evening that same day and so if you want to join him downtown for one of the workshops with the ... computer make sure it's going to be an iPhone and iPad a workshop so you bring your devices down will have his will put his up on the screen\nOr and then he can take you through some of the stuff you're you're you're going to get a a a some of the stuff you already know but you're also going to get some stuff that you probably didn't know\nAnd that's that is the the funniest part of these classes we call them light bulb moments and we build these moments into every one of our classes things that make the entire investment in the coming to one of these workshops worthwhile because you leave with it and uh and you get to use it it's practical you get to use it right away and that's what I Love most of all\nAh one of one of the big ones um this was early on one of the first ones that I threw out there was a you know we we have these words that we type in our phones\nThat are always long lick my email address Joe at Youngstown computer dot com and you type in a keyboard you'll notice it but when you have to\nDo it on a phone it takes a while to type that whole thing in so I added to my keyboard dictionary whenever I put the uh the the symbols the symbol at symbol back to back on the space bar it automatically convert that into a Joe at Youngstown computer dot com so it saves me from having to type and I do\nA ... at science based ... computer every time it saves me a ton of time so you can edit the definitions in your\nGo to settings go to a general go to keyboard and then you can make those entries in there and save yourself a ton of time so that's the kind of stuff you get interested in to take one of those seats fifty bucks a seat\nThree three oh two five nine seven to seven eight let the answering service do you want to claim one of those uh I pat or iPhone workshop seats and again that's October seventeenth a nine to twelve and also a six to eight have a very weak will see guys next week this has been the young\nPeter show on five Seventy ... [noise] ...\nThree o'clock shot Baird brothers find hard which on line at\nTheir brothers dot com\nDo use radio five Seventy WKBD a young child [noise]\nAfter all the testimony and acrimony after accusations and allegations and the Senate vote to see judge Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court now a half an hour away on Capitol Hill Democrats still voicing opposition joined on the steps outside by protesters [laughter]\nPusher on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend Leighton somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else did she said was that the party has refuted the claim\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of this panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody's ... incredible credible witness credible which is actually untrue she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple due to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party\nShe's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually given a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand has everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets that helps you need some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point of delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly\nThe second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez who says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was the quarter is if they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you're gonna remember anything and then uh she's told wrecked Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face\nThat she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on that panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed something\nHappened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it too much Kavanaugh said no never done anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them and activity to she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable\nThey rented anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible but that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Clunes they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because the calls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a nutty from outer space story she's giving\nAnd Christine Ford only vase say something happened everybody else's named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many\nOr people who didn't come to the Bush has offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter\nStar to your online NBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh um it'd be open to hearing didn't say a word

think that it probably served to motivate bows on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to any centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have set set at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close to my house but it'd be

in the beginning venture for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think ... started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up then you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about

hypocritical that here were interviewing this man to be a um fair and fair and honest person to decide that ... court cases where we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry and when he was accused of these baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to do that with Kavanaugh right if we let women like to come forward and get it kind of damage to finance reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done it when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want this ... that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came home became a citizen and she is a hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're\nExamining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair\nRight and we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\nYou couldn't be more correct I mean he's facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen and then be chargers no go and be fair and and liberal hinted about this oh I'm Sorry did that I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no uh I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was lousy for doesn't remember anything does that mean if you're good at all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lives with me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I think a parent household with that there were six cats when I was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't how my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to lift me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when after she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure cafe high\nBecause someone that was in that room where I found my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was I had a home invasion I was raped and my home at gunpoint in front of my family when I saw him in court I think he's physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memories of my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I Can't remember what I was wearing every single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't\nCompletely clear and cemented in my memory and I just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate data but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I was in law enforcement and I know what the standards are back right my got on her as now\n... and I'm ...

TV show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time a jelly and I appreciate you how're ya\nI'm wonderful how are you today\nI'm doing great you you know I started out when I answered the phone I submitted was ... year old and you actually very positive we said you know really was no vote road\nOh for me always as bright Kavanaugh said last week some of us wake up on the sunrise side of the mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive the president is doing a fantastic job in keeping us peaceful and prosperous some you can ... you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think is right the mainstream media refused to cover than they've never seen a positive data point that they have it ignored enough and I guess I'll start they'll start down ever\nCovering this economy Joe if God Forbid it ever started to go down but even all the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in women and teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate is up but even today got very little coverage anywhere\nBut there was an accident have one hundred and eighty five thousand new private sector jobs created for the last month and it said it was two hundred and thirty thousand so the wages are up the job availability up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda\nThat the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit courts and of course justice Gorsuch and\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice Kavanaugh\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a closer to the president I got to tell you ... you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet they couldn't make any things that that they brought him early on as he said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have stopped the auto of back\nWhen he was fourteen but now the guys who abuse the vice allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty concert revision while he said was already they really have nothing against the guy we have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and you've got a far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses\nMean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody were there\nAnd they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominates right Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this says this is about the strike destroying a man's life because he's he's\nWas nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping the seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it Americans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford\nHas Dianne Feinstein a Democrat is due to blame that she is now a household name recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Sherry committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed his last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats ... really nervous today because you're caught between a ... on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism\nAnd toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and who's yours in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota now spread they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt's our tells the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm I'm an investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her staff leak that out you said on this for two months she could have talked to tell them about it directly when they met privately she could've brought it to the president as soon as you got the letter\nYour rights she sat on a because you hope that they would be him down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely\nQualified to be in this job and these are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw and never say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the\nOf the letter and uh the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to forge lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to for that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell that ever happened to come to Washington either for lying under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and it's fair to tell you that there are no cameras and clean lights in private testimony in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right to take her to go and cover every jot until and a new client base for them afterward so that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for the

eight I think both teams felt they'd be much better position coming into this game\nUh we'll talk more specifics about southern Illinois coming up a bit later but let's focus on the penguins and where they are now what they have to do to get this turned around\nYeah I think both teams bra probably thought they were going to be three in one coming in here and not one and three\nTicket about Youngstown State I think a couple of things they have to do the seizure of the season is salvageable they're still games to play the Missouri Valley conference other than the top top\nTeams trying to find themselves like white issue so\nWe have time to do this but I feel number one bobbitt probably most importantly is defensively [noise]\nWe have to allow our defense a chance to be athletic and not think\nI I think they I think this is the key game last week\nYou and I saw they gave up Fifteen place so there wasn't somebody within ten yards ogre receiver\nHas to stop ... and the salute you couldn't be a better test\nPlays a game kind of team but\nThe the press has to find an identity put some pressure on the quarterbacks get some turnovers gets some confidence for the young junior

at Montgomery ... quarter last week shutting all kinds of records brace breaking completion record for white issue all time\nAttempt record all time passing your record okay that's good for you and I know that's part garbage time as well right I think the offensive coach Chris has to find an identity today I think at times we've been good running the ball at times we were good passing the ball\nBad on first down given up three yard Washington so\nI think we have to get the titans and the full backs into this game today Bob I think any good team\nEven North Dakota state that want to make a deep into a playoff run or have a winning season has to start with a good running game and I think by spreading about not having the titans and the game going empty sometimes going with one running back we have to find that identity offensively as well\nYoungstown State southern Illinois when you look at this match up they played every year since Nineteen Ninety seven white issue leads the series twelve denied last southern Illinois when here was in two thousand twelve to salute he's outta Carbondale, Illinois\nAnd a coach by ... there was a former standout quarterback at southern Illinois he led them to that then one double a semi finals in two thousand seven\nAs a quarterback was the ... coordinator before coming head coach his first year or two thousand sixty there were four

evidence or season\nHasn't happened as of yet and we'll talk again on the other side of post ... interview more about southern Illinois and you talk about identity I mean most teams have that Jim truffles seems power football\nBoth ... two years ago known for those great defensive and they re Boston and Derek Rivers and getting after the quarterback you touched on it we don't have that right now\n[noise] yeah and and I think\nA lot of people in Youngstown of talk about that like what do you think and it's taken a look at it Bob just on paper\nI think it's a couple of things I think defensively with some injuries in the backfield at a defensive and\nWe had to have some transfers\nAh from division one teams at some junior college kids step up they've been in the program Bob sixty days or right\nMaybe they don't get ... so it might be that it might be that even offensively off some of the transfer but when you really look at it on paper and nobody wants to talk about this you have\nAlmost fifty years of head coaching\nAnd coordinator coaching between Carl planning\nAnd Shane Montgomery officer forehead or shame Karl defensive coordinator with his brother that are out of this system\nThat doesn't mean what's here now is that\nIt just means that it's knew\nReproduced by any other coaches coming now so you don't have any more tenure you don't have anybody that has seen the things that shame and Carl obscene I mean Karl believe me it was a division one coach at one tell he's a defensive coordinator division I mean he's a big time defense of loss for that program [noise]\nTo me I think with coach Mick now back in the list dot coached the CEO and coach Christophe offensively I think they have to grow as well I think the identity has to come from a coordinator in the head coach down\nA coach for me and he has a plan tough yes he's recruited good ... we've seen it from camp there's good kids and everybody out there listening would be proud of but we're
