Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLet me get money from ... to our lungs [laughter] oh okay yeah another one of those things where we get the money you know even on the deal yeah I was in Congress where crime\nI think the money [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they ask a enlisting specifically asking voting for the wall\nWe shouldn't let them go they need to think so I think she may think she's on the wall and they don't ask me and let them think that right\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she was being told don't talk about impeachment just shut shut up about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group you know what our staff is saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days election they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate rather than you know responded by bumbling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of the most powerful pieces which when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's the next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with the microphone to Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh how nice red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want you know what I disagree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty and embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think the everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat but in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a vote for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week British and talk to local media to the Tennessee Senate candidate he told all the local media stations\nWell al these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing he said well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in the video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban and we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he said semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nI again I think that you're rocking the world the big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying in explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that helped them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do what\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly\nDoor to door yeah brothers sign or woods America's source diehard would

Scott has really shown if you remember showing the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney of basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the

said yesterday is why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think there's Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the the headlines\nThat are out there that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American and\nThe story of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally changed herself to minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah they're going to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the

talking about immigration itself pivot to more fruitful issues like health care and taxation\nIt's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their super Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent con be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even the CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again if Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like you didn't two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help the feed her uh if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be\nJoe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow path if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state Tennessee writes then\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nNow there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my God they're eight million\nDollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats\nAnd now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty midterms I have got against the party in power by an average that something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you you hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores in gas stations and grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nI'm not allowed to say the word mob parts they will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill or will come back we're also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that when we get back eight hundred nine four one showing your calls in the final half hour\nThe top in thirty minutes past the hour and it's at the time to

doctors um and of course Obamacare because it seems to be the only one issue now that Democrats want to run on and boy it's such a bad portrayal inaccurate portrayal of what they have for us the pound the country and the differences dramatic it's different in\nAny way we put it up on Hannity dot com you can read it for yourself\nOr as we have a lot of articles up there that you can read or write as promised we got a lot going on eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program Jimmy is in Mississippi will start with you this half hour Jimmy Hi welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nLike you say it's the talk anyway you talk and here we are going on\nOut there like I Know you've been in my living room so many times in mid run around with me in the car\n[laughter] [noise] well do you want to know the truth you really do know me\nYou know one thing I've always said is you really can't fake it for three our four hours a day\nI mean he me on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just\nWe don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain who you really are especially that's why they call radio a warmth medium\n... you're exactly right you're exactly right look shutting the reason that caught ... I was listening on your program yet they find a ... from the army Clinton's speech and in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it dawned on me that's extortion selling us telling the American people\nThe only way you don't have any peace impressed shut up shut up if Democrats\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince that day Donald Trump\nWon the left in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob and some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this remember Maxine Waters set it if\nYou see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department\nStores in gas stations and and restaurants and you\nTell them you know wanted anywhere anymore okay well that sounds like you want something bad to happen\nAnd the fact that the Democrats are now the strategy is to hide who they are don't be honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos\nOr ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters tests that they keep telling me not to say it then you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because that you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win\nHad that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian tough the a ... and then had all of our deep state friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives\nThis is who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad ... building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's\nI'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're gonna watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe it maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained a couple seats in the Senate when\nMaybe they lose the house you lose the house then all you're going to see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's it\nThere's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... and so there's a lot of states\nNo one is a good thing do I have a problem and when they say no you'll feel better about that but likewise you know what we want us to talk of them not just about breast cancer but colonoscopies worst part of a colonoscopy is the preparation or you know just drink and stuff and\nUh having a night of a thousand waterfalls and that kinda stuff but once you get beyond that the test itself is no big deal colon cancer is a big deal and we're starting to see cancers in people at a younger age\nThey used to say is I was telling them get a call and ask for you and your fifty or even older than fifty now they're dropping at age down\nIn large part because of our diets be American diet which is getting people fat or if you will type two diabetes is off the chart because we're eating the wrong foods I mean if people are just on their cell phones are watching TV or\nSitting down too much so they don't get any exercise eating the wrong foods and that can lead\nTo a cancer issue uh\nAs as a result of that or leads to that I should say type two diabetes which can lead to other problems\nBut you know when it comes to these cancer things the same diet that causes type two diabetes causes colon cancer and who knows what other issues that they can have when you're overweight and this kind of stuff so if you get these tests and you can catch his stuff early it that decision you\nMake can change you\nBetween life and death and your survive ability right which I think is a something that role recently shouldnt fear the test and most insurance companies these days cover these tests are ... they're just part I Do think that change with Obamacare where these tests\nAre covered\nMammograms and call and ask a piece in this kind of stuff it was one of the things that I think was a ... in Obamacare with the coverage for that so it doesn't really cost you very much ... nothing if anything uh as far as that goes so there's no reason for you not\nTo take advantage of all of that and with all of our facilities here [laughter] you should be able to do that All right with that being said now\nI mentioned is when they started to the broadcast today and this is what's wrong in America\n[noise] Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage a signaling cultural and economic shift that are here to stay\nWell that's according to a new report from the United nations forty percent of all births in the U.S now her outside of wedlock up from ten percent Nineteen Seventy according to an annual reports released Wednesday by the United nations population funds the largest international provider of sexual reproductive health the numbers even higher in the European Union\nSo they're saying this is a cultural change that's going on not just in the United states of America\nBut in Europe as well uh that's what people are having children and they're not married\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and the European Union are predominantly to unmarried couples living together rather than to single mothers the report says the data suggests that the a\nSocietal and religious norms about marriage childbearing in women in the workforce have changed\nThose are the words of Kelly Jones she's the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research Jones also noted that the rise in birth outside of marriage is court closely correlated to delays in childbearing how 'bout that women are\nCleaning their ground professionally she said delaying motherhood is a rational decision when you consider the impact that can have on your career and that's contributing to this trend\nThe average age an American woman has her first child is now\nTwenty seven up from twenty two and Nineteen Seventy\nAs for the marriage rates that has fallen in us

low\nLast year according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention Herman said the rice and bursts outside of wedlock has actually\nMitigated the decline in fertility which would be much deeper if women or and having children outside of marriage the trend will continue there's no doubt about it he said we can't go back to the fifties\nI bet you didn't know I I bet you didn't know any of that I thought that was interesting that that's that's just a new trend that's out there the idea of let's get married let's have children that is\nThe thinking of the past and that's the
