Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get it and he called them the blue collar billionaire and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background is similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not their jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know

Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is a bad aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot just ties or through a political system ... never happens black markets crop up and then there was a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody out for them\nAnd when I was just devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making it an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nBut we're living shot so so I wanted I did a ton of research on the book\nI wanted to tell the story or a couple of Trump's family which is a great American success many ways the added he family is also an American success story the arts are different and the generational transfers are different uh but they're part of America the part of the African American\nYou know the the generations the built this country and I don't know if it's Scaramucci Hannity Trump it doesn't matter but the generations of built this country are just amazing people the immigrants that built this country by grandparents all

the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nUh the here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to
