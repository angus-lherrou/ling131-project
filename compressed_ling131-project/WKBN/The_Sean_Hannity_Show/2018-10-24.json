co workers provide some benefits the economy as a whole it also friends to the press further the wages blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put them into deportation until\nWe have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair it was just 'cause I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration alright amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way Hillary Clinton would have been at\nThe president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on a loan that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up uh I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact would that he's going to have on both this year's election and onto them two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and idle and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThen you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico in if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they were turned back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he'd dean should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision he just has to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons\nAnd that block\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border and my fear is if they get\nTo the border that would could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember\nIn the near future the next few weeks our policy should be\nTo hope for the best plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons doing nothing they decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact create or an effect human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and the Mexicans are going to have what what could be but it down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people 'cause they ask keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real to send them and this is this is what Lincoln saying over and over again yeah uh you know if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union and he didn't\nAll right if that's part of your parents process yeah and that kind of stuff yes All right and Ken some of these other therapies that that are here are they covered by insurance you know the hot rocks and all this kind of stuff\nIt's how we use them it's how they're applied so\nThey're using them as a manual toll exact with deep kiss you with us\nOr you want me to Laura die from when you started physical therapy to where it is today the advances that have been made in it\nYes and I am amazed that people are more and more private pain so that's a good thing for us so when you're asking if insurance cover some of these things sometimes they don't but we are we do have private pay programs that\nWhile you were people that almost like if they go to um a Seuss or something like that I Know\nYeah they can come in and get like the deep tissues that that ... moist heat mhm if they just went that yes\nRight but but initially though a physical therapist has to kind of examine them first to see if that's\nWhat we try to do at ... at all as a plus\nAll right so the so to see what their need is obviously it's easy for you if a guy at a knee replacement obviously it's easy for you if if some procedure took place right to know what the problem is easier yeah right you've seen a million times but you also a million times I'm Talking with physical therapist rising I like that and the tea rising\nBut back pain is a more difficult thing to deal with it not\nYet is there there's just so many things that can be involved I you know everything from a mechanism injury that length of time to our radiation into the legs or you know various places\nAddict cover yeah so how not ready to go out there is a red flag issues that can cause back pain that on our scope how do you diagnose a ... diagnosis is very important yes we should ... things out as we get along\nExactly yeah so ... what she's saying is if you if you come to us\nWithout seems very smart I mean I got to tell you that right off the bat very impressed with her I have a ... I like you to [laughter] you know I mean\nShe seems really like she's smart on what she's doing but I mean so the hardest part is diagnosing where you start isn't it yes yeah and how do you figure that out by movements in this kind of stuff\nSure we have a different special tests that we use and the clinic so when you come in for your evaluation you meet me or whatever physical therapist is treating you and I we we take you through just some tests I mean some of them involve bending are standing up or you know we'll check your strength and your range of motion and\nRebel compile information from all these things that are history pieces together of the puzzle and make it the history observation\nYeah and then and then you after you do that you say this is where I think you know the problem was coming from and this is what we're going to do for exactly yeah and there might be some discomfort within sometimes or might not be right\nYeah yeah yeah we we always warn people you know something might bother them we say if this is painful just stop you know let us know what's going on and you know before we even do anything that might hurt\nBut sometimes you know uh I think you need that expertise from a physical therapist oh yeah I mean the the I I Know the schooling is\nWorth ... insurance companies would prefer them to try physical therapy before they paid for an expensive MRI or\nCats game so sometimes we can save money for people\nRight and I am to ... but obviously when you're going through this process you have to communicate with your person's doctor I was there that's their\nPrimary care physician or if it's especially Dr\nYeah and the and ultimately you also when you chart a path to chart a path of progress to write you at this point in time you should be getting better and you guys\nKnow every time they come in we have to document paint levels how they're feeling all of that and their notes and then what we're doing to help them feel better and then at the end we have to shell objective data outcome\nRight so that are ... you can say let's say a nine weeks this person should be back then or right are you surprised how often that happens\nI don't know honestly I mean this is what I Do every\nDay okay but when the ... is with the patient sometimes very discouraged like ... you know ... and ... and then when let's say nine weeks later when they're back to normal or they like I never thought to stay with\nIt but when that happens and they went and I mean he had six years old\nI wanted to me that rarely always have to explain a healing process yeah not an event usually\nSometimes a relaxation a part of it that you you shouldn't overdo it or over work and and the thing you know like you got to stop doing this for a while so that this will\nYeah behavioral modification yes that's real important\nYeah really yeah we would depends on the injury injury injury that you're ... flaring up by doing some activity and sometimes\nYou know about that activity or even ... or ... for a while if they have to do something like that everyday\nIt's really hard to tell it you know a sixteen year old high school football player you know that has a cry sprained ankle to they have to sit out the next two games so you know it it just it's a lot of times it's a judgment call how severe as the injury ... you know how how important is it simply continue doing what they're doing and then you know you make that decision with the patient their parents\nCycling athletes feel really quick\nEverybody involved really so it's every situation that you you know the different animal\nNow if I asked Linda die the founder er lord I should say the founder\nOf tooth or physical therapy when you look at your ... your facility and the people that work at your facility obviously I I I must say I'm very impressed with the rising you seem like it'd be pretty sharp guy to me so she uh she obviously you have a pretty good standard of hiring people that you hire you're looking for\nAnd I try to hire everyone that's just like ... [laughter] yeah I Do I Try to hire a really good people I been lucky to have finally found a great management team we have a great billing department and\nThey work with people on a daily basis and I get credit\nTo the building department they can take care of the building and take care of the insurance stuff yeah I mean I mean that is really tough that's a big burden off of people's back right off the back to have that yes yeah so hats off to the building department I give you credit but ideally though using at the person that's doing the hands on treatment or that makes the biggest that that's the real\n... I Try to look for that when I hire him but I also promote like I said that the courses to go to and educate them\nMyself or get manners like a dance or there's other great PTA's at work for two two are that have been around for Fifteen sixteen years so I Try to put on what the appropriate people that that the area they want to go in that direction they want to go into and just learn from them so\nRight and at some point do some point physical therapy though has changed a little bit to to the comfort care that you were saying about right sure I mean it's really expanded 'cause I never knew that even existed till I was looking at this kind of stuff yeah it's a pretty I mean you got to kind of spread the word on that because\nPeople always trying to know people always say physical therapy is oh well you know I had a knee replacement ... I mean that's what I think of I Would have never known I Do too I like I say\nMy mother's been coming on and off for five years [laughter] because we're like her best friend like I said so if you can keep them off medications and keeping them then that's the that's the way to go\nYou know we also retreat vertigo we treat balance and disorders a hoax Parkinson's or a hoax I spent a long time hospitals that have gotten week now they're having a hard time walking you know they can't get up and down the stairs so you know we see the whole gamut of uh problems it's not just orthopedic\nA muscular skeletal issues caused by an injury so to speak\nSo I think it's really important to mention that kind of stuff I mean I Would have I I\nI did my program my program is really good and I have to say kudos to those therapist because it's hard work and they do a great job\nAmazing work once again Olympic team is what I don't quite\nAnd its swelling of an extremity aren't also happen in the

you\nSeven oak long shot by American source for fine art ... rather saw me this news radio\nFive seven WCBS young [noise]\nFrom the scene is\nDairy all they are who sent them and why those are the questions federal officials are trying to figure out after what appears to be a series of explosive devices were set to the Clintons Obama's Eric Holder Maxine Waters George source and John Brennan via CNN based\nAnd the mobs in the case as I was talking about you know let through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a store\nAbout George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday like they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left is called the list of George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop this crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces fitting it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue\nBut there's it's obvious but what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video up Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing\nMob and then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife id they go to sit down at a restaurant\nThere run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out these incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second you know but if Donald Trump\nCalls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global Islam I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he's a racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure\nAnd the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just just proportionally impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American hurt I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and chapel claw similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious package sent the Debbie Wasserman Schultz who's officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant in department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know firsthand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda\n... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent don't get packages anymore in my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media is dawn wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama recall there was another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story but\nIf you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump's\nDefense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve skull east nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations that barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin ... heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nSince then I'm also going to prove
