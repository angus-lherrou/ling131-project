{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "And and and ... there's like a chart that almost it almost go straight up on that as some people have on this it's not like don't hire high higher loews or or planning out potentially a looks like a bomber walk or just purchased pop straight up\nThat's what I'm looking for because that's that's going to be a warning sign to me that hey ... you know they're they're setting up the short this thing\nMake money on on both ways and then you want to answer your question of how to defeat that is as long as you know that there's no guarantee on this but you set your stop offices in tight set your stop offices and tighter to limit orders in tight and or just have a have a target price on what you think you should make on a\nOn a physician in in if it sells out of cells out and um and just move on from there you can't look back and people have some money on the table never apologized for making profit uh that's the only mean you can do to prepare for it because\nProtecting the market and and and that's fattening where I got my information from is the ... a lot of folks that I I respect that pre sheet their intelligence on that are saying the same thing second quarter beginning a third quarter maybe the start of a recession or a major pull back from the stock market\n[noise] they ... I think you appreciate the phone call\nYou know there's some smart people out there with some really excellent call ins insightful question so they're talking the third quarter of two thousand Nineteen right I mean and and that's a ways off to to even make any type of predicts you wouldn't you agree I mean there's so many variables that could change\nA ... this is not like it's been in the past ... as far as history\nSimply because of what we're doing as far as renegotiating deals America First and the\nTariffs and and and what have you are going on all of that could be changed dramatically and things could still continue to boom in two thousand Nineteen I mean there is a possibility\nYou know this is a horrible thing to say but it's the truth my entire life and career as a gas\nI literally gas every day what I'm doing and and the two thousand nine teams against as well\nSo your statement as exactly accurate we don't know if you're not gonna Nineteen I could have a lot on my face and say and have critics say the calculator she thousand Nineteen I couldn't be happier but my my uh production if you want to call it that of\nYou know fall back in two thousand nineteenth or it was wrong I couldn't be happier about being wrong I I I'm just guessing it you know circumstances surrounding\nMistake I might get my you know my best ... that's the truth and that's what every guy in our industry man and woman who's doing the work guessing every day and\nAnd the analysts when you see him on CNBC and blew up to do the same thing\nThere are trying their best educated guess out they're based on the facts and that's another thing that's scary as we're using history but\nThe truth of the matter is he in numbers do not have memory\nAnd as much as you want to believe it that the truth of the matter is even today stock market has nothing to do what stock market in Nineteen eighty seven thousand or two thousand two or Nineteen Ninety eight\nIt just doesn't as much as we want it to this pattern in the last time the market these things these three things that that this ... it's all baloney it's all phony it's tricking the matter is it's just stuff that\nMakes the news sound good and makes guys like a small you know some smart but really no one knows that's the truth no one knows where just thrown her best guess out they're based on what we have given it\nAny any hang on for a ride and it makes sense\nMost most of the stuff that I read it seems to express the biggest concern that I read as far as the stock market where it's going John isn't so much about earnings or\nOr or what have you it is more about what the fed is doing and raising interest rates and can they continue to raise them too fast to where it's detrimental to the economy that if I had to say that seems to be the biggest concern out there would you give me and I kept on that that seems to be\nA somewhat I Would you agree with that\nYeah I I agree with that I agree with that the thing is is so becomes that fed there's such a power they're powerful they're their own entity no one's above that and and you never know what they're thinking or you never know what they're going to do\nAnd that's what makes it so scary the answer to know and and and I so I agree with your assumption\nAnd that can never had a dramatic effect obviously focus on on on the market 'cause if you raise things too fast you can actually stifle economic growth and to actually set the economy back\nA ... you know if you if you hike this stuff up too much because there there seems to be I mean oil prices seem to be in line\nOf everything else I've read Jon so far has been positive for granted I Will acknowledge some degree of of of disagreement with you on China and tariffs you know some people view that as more detrimental than you do\nBut the but other people are always citing the interest rates on the fed but everyone everything else that I read Jon ... is just like you said calling for a good time at Christmas Time because of higher wages and and just how the economy's going in general I don't see\nA negative I I'm not you know I Try my best to cipher through to find any negative trends that I could ask you about that's the only one I mean there's two that I see the interest rates and some of the disagreement people have with you on the tariffs outside of that I don't really see any John\nYou felt like because you you're you're in the evenings I Am every day for ... you see as your paycheck or has has your cost of living\nExcept for the property taxes which I Know you agree on\nBut as far as I'm just going to the grocery store\nBuying this or that you're home I have not found all my pocketbook I hadn't thought of change of course nobody likes spending money but the fact that you have to spend money to give stuff in your house I haven't seen this great Chinese a bogeyman tariffs that that everybody's talking about I have not seen\nI haven't done that Florida and I haven't seen it I\nKnow and I and you know people keep talking about that\nHappening and I don't know when when that supposed to happen you know they keep talking while it this is going to go up at\nTwelve hundred or Fifteen hundred dollars or whatever that\nThe cases I keep hearing these numbers but as to this point in time of your questions do I see it anywhere the answer to that has no\nI don't know if that will be the case six months from now or a year from now but right now I don't I don't see that happening my biggest concern to answer your question is well some of these companies use that as an excuse to raise prices or tried to gouge people I Would hope that wouldn't be the case with American companies competing against each other\nAs well I really think that he will get China in line and they want they will still contribute in our marketplace significantly they just won't be pulling some of the shenanigans they will still be their products will still come here uh actually I think what's going to happen in China and more optimistic with it than pessimistic as some of these people are\nUh but I Confess to you I'm concerned about the constant rise in interest rates I really think the economy starting to soar and I think that can be a big damper on it if they jump way too soon uh on on that kind of stuff so I Hope that isn't the case I Hope they're smart enough to say let's slow this down instead of raising it\nUh all the time for whatever reason but with that being said let's talk about you connecting with John aren't a lot of people find how do they get a hold of you I mean John Arnold is with us every Monday at six o'clock I mean have you got to admit this he calls him as he sees them folks right here I mean\nHe doesn't hold anything back if you want to talk to John about your investments how do you do that John\nGive us a call for a free consultation at three three zero\nNine six five Ninety nine zero again three three zero nine six five and a nine zero and now there's no pressure free consultations and now he just won a second opinion about your portfolio and you don't want to move to us that's fine that's just part of the program and\nThat is that we enjoy we enjoy the phone calls the appointments\nRight and one other thing just as as I Know I think the thing that you brought up is the biggest concern to the potential future the economy I think you brought up an issue that I don't see us much\nAbout what you spoke about the mid term election outcomes I think and I have a big effect on economy later shit [noise]\nTime you have an oak long shot of American source providing hard they're rather solve this news radio\nFive seven young [noise]\nI'm Gary all they are the first year olds but did they give us a deadly shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue start tomorrow as President Trump is set to visit the community\nYou know well gun issues or listen they're there to me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school\nAnd that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments\nIt's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not our big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my named brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because\nPeople obviously know nothing about me\nThey know nothing about you know they don't take the time to either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is caught and we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have in his his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it\nIt's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric when we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow them into restaurants and the department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted any anywhere anymore\nWell how is that going to end well\nHold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again Blumenthal when I was coming out there was it was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation\nI invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there that we have you\nKnow all these bombs that are sent out the first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spend to silence made you know what I still believe in freedom\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House has that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump\nLook if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country\nCan chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter those guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then that heat the this killer lamenting there's there's no ... as long as there's a\nYou know bad word of a quote infants the infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted that the president words matter silences complicity what is he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman\nTweeting a link to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do a Trump\nOh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column in the\nDaily Caller today and he's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized\nPresidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison this is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd they went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hid the picture for eight years shame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame\nTam Keith Ellison joins with ferrets ... Khan one of the greatest purveyor of anti some medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh master comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nTerrible persecution over the years\nRead it we've studied it they've gone through it all and we still see so much of it it is growing by leaps and bounds sadly all across Europe it's getting scary\nAll these countries that seek Israel's destruction radical Islam is Iranian mullahs chanting death to Israel\nOr president said we will see their destruction which is standing holy behind in the right way Israel or as so many people\nHave been you know victims of anti Semitism\nYou know Sarah Sanders pointing out is there any tragedy the Washington Post won't exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because the president is an unapologetic\nDefender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel we haven't had a president in modern history that has stood by our closest friends and allies Israel in the middle east ever and what an act of courage was apparently but there's other presidents have promised it never did it and making Jerusalem the rifle capital of Israel\n[noise] anyway we're going to get to all of that at Fox News similarly under attack I've

all of this and you go back to the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't hear many people on the left to cry the angry mobs that were going on in the halls of Congress I I got to the point where I said probably it's better if we cleared the halls of the public\nOr you would think in the people's house that the people would be allowed to go where their elected officials are but it was obviously becoming\nUnsafe for people senators being spit at you saw the treatment of you know we've had in recent weeks what do we have rice and sent or what was supposed to be rice and sent to Susan Collins

God\nBut that wasn't Donald Trump's fault\nAnd then you can look at this terrible tragedy and they're shooting in the synagogue but this rabbit anti Semite racist and also a Trump ... not that it
