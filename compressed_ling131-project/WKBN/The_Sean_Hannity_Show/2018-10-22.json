{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "He's now focusing on China in ... his argument is China needs us more to me that they need our marketplace they're going to come around to I'd like to comment on that as well\nI'm In saying that now for the past two years and I agree with that statement I've never agreed more even economists to cannot stand\nPresident Trump say he's right\nUm they need us you know you're not buying hundred dollar Nike shoes or if you're if you're if you're working for three dollars an hour and you're living in a in a hot somewhere in your\nYour second John as as a rice fields you're just not but you are you are buying those you are buying which China you are buying their trinkets if you're working for thirty three bucks an hour of benefits of GM or if you're working you're working on the shop\nKnown whatever for for X Y or Z Corporation they absolutely need the western civilization for that seat they absolutely need\nUnited States to succeed on their economy\nHas the reason why they haven't called her debt they know they need us and yes absolutely we truly do not need now\nAre they ... for for our our employers out there that are there are sending jobs over to them to you know for a less regulation and three to five bucks an hour on you know wages you know maybe they need them but I got to tell you the ...\nAmerica overall has had enough of that there's there's are definitely being\nAn internal war being raised in America here to where people are pro American people are I Know me I'm On the pay ... for a product or service if I Know my fellow guy or my fellow woman or are they are making that and that's employing them\nAnd a lot of people feel that way so uh that underlines exactly go all the way down to Youngstown, Ohio exactly how and why I Believe that statement to be true and and I got to tell you I got to bounce it back to you do you believe that\nDo I believe that this is the best economy or or no attorney that you know I yeah I Know you you know and we don't need that I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you I think the guy is brilliant I think Trump\nStarts with an extreme position a of tariffs and he throws at all against these people who have been screwing us for years\nAnd then he gets to where he wants to go where it's fair to the United states and it's a better deal for the United states and he takes this stuff away and that's how we bring some of the table and I think he's doing the same thing with China in essence\nI get frustrated with the media 'cause I think the media wants him to say oh I'm only kidding there we're going to wait and see he's not going to reveal a strategy he's not going to tell anybody listen I'm going to come at these guys with tariffs I'm going to come after him with everything\nAnd they're going to come to us because they need our marketplace and I'm going to get a better deal for the United states when it comes to screw in us on our patents in this kind of stuff\nJust like when I watch Leslie stall tried to say last I Can't just say something nasty about this world leader that world leader and he didn't fall into that trap because he's he's trying to get things from these people\nAre to reach ... we're reaching agreements as opposed to saying on network TV this guy's an ass\nWhen it's either dealmaker and remember this Ron [laughter]\nWhen I worked for John what's known as an accurate ... he said in ... someone's getting salt\nPeriod you're either getting so old that they don't want the item you're selling or here or there getting sold that you are getting ... they want the item recently period and\nAnd and at the end of the day he was a super negotiator his job is to play the best steak deck of cards\nThat he can even including what Ronald Reagan when he made a Russia's believe that we were building some Star Wars outer space war machine when it was all fallacy he played them Houston that goes you played them like a federal made them spend money they didn't have one\nI'm right in the bankruptcy and Trump is playing these folks ... like a federal and and and I love the beauty of it and uh and and that's what he's doing\nI mean I I was refreshing to hear your comments because\nI truly sit back and I I Am genuinely concerned and I'd be I'd be willing why anyone would say let's put the Democrats in charge and tried to impeach cabin on beach Trump's stall everything when everything seems to be going in the right in the right direction when everything economically speaking\nAnd in every way unemployment is down ... the\nGDP Growth is up our renegotiating these deals are I don't see a bad sign out there at all I mean not a bad sign for America the economy and who knows what's next why would I Want to get bogged down\nIn this stuff that bothers me a lot as to how we could do derail the train\nLine tell you something no one's talking about an hour and that's probably the most important thing out there no one talks about are kinda anymore no one talks about ISIS anymore no one no one is is is scared that the next time they flying an airplane\nIt might get blown out of the sky because they're they're\nThey're strong in article ... scares of Jesus how these folks those Middle East crazies are scared of Trump they're scared because they know or they think that he will push the button and brought him to smithereens or blow Moscow\nAnd I think that's how you lead I think you leave with power I think you need would fear against people they're going to that they're trying to kill everything we stand for\nAnd no one's giving him credit for that either and I and and that's fundamentally\nRight connected to the economy you know the the market was going down and two thousand one before nine eleven but when nine eleven hit that was that was the actual that was the nail in the coffin for the economy that was going to nail in the coffee for the stock market\nIt wasn't a nine eleven that caused the market crashed granted they were just nine eleven he finished it off\nAnd if you get a terrorist attack that will definitely induce fear in the market in the world it will cause panic\nAnd panic selling and that guy the way he's doing things by ... you know making them afraid of vox for a change and and putting our line in the sand and saying you're not going to you're not going to hurt one more American Life or we're going to destroy you I Love that and I'm for that right I mean there were about\nI don't know what they expect even like today they announced to this and what the Saudi Arabia or whatever announced that they ... they might not might have that they killed\nThe ... guy who went to their compound or whatever in in ... bad so look how little time it took to get them to admit but they did this and now they're making it an excuse in interrogation that went bad\nAnd Trump is saying listen we're still going to sell them their weapons because of they don't buy 'em from us so by from Russia and we don't want to lose those jobs but there's gotta be consequences but they pony up to the table pretty quick cure I miss a van\n... really I mean I knew the marry again guide lead with our ... he's going to swing it in ... meter there may know and that's what we need\nAll right so the foreign foreign run out of time I just want to say well\nYou're not

there's absolutely credible evidence that unknown middle Easterners or in a caravan of Central American migrants headed for the U.S we have\nAnd then you've got a case in allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements in his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nOr apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this have you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent this about it a great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax the Gillum would support\nGillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected\nBy being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is it in the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee\nAnyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Bredesen is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing and the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets whoops so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate ice ... open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cost\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process that we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call\nOf course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town and meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about quote the blue wave\nAnd

immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance they appear confident that\nThis confrontation is going to come down to this is this is extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans didn't think they bleep don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country\nWe don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid for Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] you
