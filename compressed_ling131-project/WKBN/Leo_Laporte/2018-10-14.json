ravaged parts of Florida and Georgia tomorrow FEMA administrators Brock Long says the commander in chief may be shocked by what he said\nHere's the problem and here's the problem block might work in what apple saying is well known as soon as the bad guys and by the way that guys don't want your day that they want your hardware so you're probably fine but as soon as the bad guys got your computer a ... and tried to boot it you'd get to your password\nAnd they don't or your password so they go goalie\nIf a bag I really wanted it though he could get it he could open up the computer takes the hard drive out and put it in another computer where they could read the hard drive are they going to do that no they're there for the money money they just want to sell that thing so that you're fine\nSo what they'll do is just the race the hard drive and sell it just as hot\nHere's what's gonna happen and they're not even gonna are racist they drove off three blocks\nAnd they and they and they try to get somebody to buy it off of them because they just almost certainly they just want the cash as fast as possible the longer they hold on to that computer the more risk they might have gone to a pawn shop but much more likely the reason is in South Compton they sold it on the streets\nFor probably ... bucks then at that point the guy who bought it the soccer by the way who bought it boots it up\nAnd he's getting your password he knows his stone or if he if he knows Maxwell\nEnough he can't erase it and and make it his but it's not it's not that easy he has to hold down command option PR [laughter]\nAnd the race it and I think even certainly with iPhones and iPads and I bet you even with max these days you might even have to enter your password just to race it yeah and in which case\nHe goes oh shoot I shouldn't have spent twenty five dollars for this Mac and throws a track\nWhat I what I Wonder as if that's the case yeah my like I said my neighbors they had their stolen too and why is there a market for them if if they just send up the indoor stop\nWell what kind of person burglar rises homes not the brightest person in the world right [noise]\nYeah they want to say you know they just need cash they're probably drug addicts need cash or the\n... the market for these things iPhones still gets stolen even though they're completely useless to anybody but the owner you cannot reuse it uh I don't know if the ... that that way or not but it looks like a nice fancy piece of gear and I can see somebody's you know given uh fifty bucks for it they're sure not getting the value for it which is really sad right\nAnd of course it's much more valuable to you than the hardware even because your stuff is on it\nThat's why well two things everybody should be doing your ah you hear me preached this backup right so then you\nNeed it back up on some external hard drive but I kind of I kind of looking at your carbon I Am\nYeah it'd be a good a good always up to date back up as vital\nYou can do it locally there's all sorts of ways to do it you don't have to spend money on a on a service I mean I like that idea but you can do it you can do it locally but the key is to have it and more importantly keep it up to date because you never know although honestly if you do it locally and you get burglar rise so sorry this happened to you\nUm they might take those hard drives too so that's why some offsite white carpet is a good idea\nAnd then the second thing you should do and everybody right now do it if you if you're operating system offers encryption Macintoshes do go to the security system preference pain and turn on what they call it ... volt [noise] and then no matter what happens your data safe the bad guys can't get into it\nYou you want to make sure you have a good password but it's encrypted so\nEven if they took it out of the computer put it in another computer they couldn't read it and that's that's what ... does for him on windows unfortunately Microsoft only bundles bit locker which is it's encryption to on the pro versions of windows they don't put it on home and I wish they really auto or that they really ought to 'cause every in my ...\nYou know nowadays especially with solid state garage before I use any thoughts they drive whether it's a phone and traveled her computer I turn on encryption or that way if I lose it\nNobody's going to get my data do that for the next one yeah do you have insurance is insurance going to get you a new one\nYeah but there was no but it just covers there's so much that was on it but I didn't backup\nSometimes why I'm so sorry [noise] anyway\nIf I get a new IMAX is there anything I should wait for early\nOr they go they're up to date on the IMAX cool the new IMAX this year for sure well thank you so much yeah I'm\nSorry that happened in the end you enjoy your new computer just an excuse to get a new system\nI think of it that way yeah why is there a market but you know why is there a market for any stolen stuff really shouldn't be right [noise] the world we live in our show today [laughter] [noise]\nOh what can I say our show today oh look at is what a coincidence or should they\nBrought you buy carbon [laughter] these guys are smart car behind his back I see I don't want to even use the word backup anymore with carbon I don't want to call I Want to call them the

percent and you know and that that's the problem and put the genie out of business\nWhich in my opinion is not a bad thing at all know what are you wouldn't you like to every month sending them a bill yeah yeah you owe me for all this electricity and in you\nYeah I Would like to find out how this compares to our you know roof installation\nYeah still the guy said this will power a smaller house a

Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd she was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in the pool with some kids\nAnd when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just grab the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nHe decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't to come together so he created this water park thirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs an America that one out of three people yeah\nAnd so now what hit the big they're big thing was that you know for kids who are electric wheelchair that's powered by either electric battery or they have a breathing machine they could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that ... work wheelchair oh my God so they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp\nFor for ... with a zip line and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can do is lined with kids in wheelchairs breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you got to watch this video of creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New

if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh it's just that line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a\nLot of water slide wow a line\nThat you don't need to take the wheelchair on the zip line or do you I think you do so you want to share with them\nYeah that's interesting very oh so\nWhat did you get that out and it's such a neat idea Morgan's in wonderland in San Antonio Texas for ... magazine yeah ...\nAnd then you've got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see now at least family I said I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate\nI'm so he flew British Airways non-stop flight six hours or like sixty five people on or triple seven ...\nI Love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face on roe [laughter] yeah basically he did

they department they transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and I did it's called um black

they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up and plumes started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links is router links to just wipe their hands ... thanks good luck have fun\nAnd so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say\nLook we ... you know we have additional features you can pay for eroding our one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus\nSign in boxing you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you get ad blocking and you get regular updates so that's something to be aware of mesh routers cost more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is this space\nAt the Oregon artist ... house\nOkay so it's not a huge effect most space stations will cover that easily a single ...\nThe question or the concern that I have though is like with the airport three of software that through networks one but it's just one for one for the ... noticed comments [noise] I'm In San ... is from our systems is that while it's cast and you can separate network for her [noise]\nYeah the idea that ... the idea behind ... is will do it you just take it from here and I have a say in most cases unless you really know what you're doing that the best way to do it\nAnd people can there's a lot of ... that people can think they are going to choose the channel I'm going to choose the frequency I'm going to make it better and they screw things up so unless you're a network ... or ...\nOr ... yeah I set up for it says you need it for you have to choose\nWhether rings should automatically a good ... D device and I will not all of them do this but will no no that that's the two point four and beyond the two point four actually with the rat with the ... I don't think you're gonna have a problem with that um it if you ... it can sometimes be a problem on some poorly designed ... stuff where they see two signals\nA five year hurts in a two point four and they choose the wrong one they can't handle it I've had that happened with a device and then you just have to reset the device and choose the other one but in a way that's more likely if you have to you know to route or is it to to to two brothers one rather to different frequencies you might choose the wrong one\nAnd so I wouldn't I use the ring with ear a he's a plumber ear I use it I have both plumbing erode home I use the ring with the euro I'm In no problem [noise] I didn't I didn't do anything special it just to automatically and then like\nA a a we know of flaws I think it's the last ... um I thought it was\nWell I I was there having problems with ... in some wife by a a router so you should always make sure that you choose a router that works best or works well with your ... devices and we mow I Know he's had problems I Can't remember with which ones\nI Would for the size place you have\nI think you know what's nice now is some of the old school router companies like a Seuss and ... are doing links this or doing they have you know in the case next next year and links is they have ... but they're doing even in their regular you know stand alone single wife ... points they have a lot of ... features [noise]\nSo um you know you might look at two hundred bucks\nFrom a Amazon the net gear night hawk that's uh the wire cutters pick for ... three stream NATO to data Lebanese sea route or just a little it's a it's actually a one eighty five it's a little less than the old airport extreme and I would say it's very comparable to it\nAnd uh I think they're going to keep that up to date if you want to mash\nI Love your oh I Love the extra features of euro plus\nPlume is is good and for a certain things I use it for my generally for my eye on the devices are because erode is um is very good if it's kind of small focused why\nAnd then another really good choice or is this analogy Archie twenty six hundred I think is a is a really it's two hundred bucks a really nice rather than an allergy has demonstrated that they will keep the software up to date they really they do in the network attach storage devices as well and they really seem committed to keeping stuff up today\nThat number that job one right now for a ride around or is your first line of defense against the bad guys outside so a ... a ... year if you want a ...
