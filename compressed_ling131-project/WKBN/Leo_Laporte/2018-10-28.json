M. C. and by the way or the or just a management controller this reset is different on every kind of back on most IMAX this is how you do it it's a little weird unplug the power cord wait Fifteen seconds\nThen you attach to power cord wait five seconds and you turn on the computer that's not going to fix it all this is just just to this is just one thing to try\nThe other one is shut it down after if that doesn't work shut it down and hold command option pie and our that's for keys all the same time command option your commands the funny ...\nPie and our whole that down\nAnd you're going to hear the bomb here a couple of times and then let go and what you're doing there is clearing the parameter ram\nThat stores information about the hardware these are two different things that every Mac user [laughter] is familiar with and is probably tried\nThey sometimes work they sometimes work sometimes not the next step would\nBe to whole turn the computer all the way off again for the third time and then hold command are when you're rebuilding it that's the reset key and allow you to re install the operating system maybe it just didn't install properly\nSo you it'll it'll bring you to a screen that says don't a race that Dr she's got data on there but it'll say install Mac OS ten Mojave\nAnd and go through that process if none of that works the good news is there's an apple store and Edison [laughter] I think it might be a it might be appropriate to take it down there they're pretty good about or at least walking\nThrough some of these steps they'd probably do at least those three things and then if not they may may identify another problem and and and then she might have a repair bill\nBut usually they'll at least try a few of those things chat rooms also saying might not be a bad idea\nTo boot too safe mode which is a this is the fourth thing shut it all the way down again pressing hold the shift key and turn it on and keep holding it till the boots up that is a that is a safe from ... will not install a lot of drivers and stuff if it turns out that some of the things\nOrder machine are incompatible with a new operating system that would be a very good way to uh to turn those off and if it starts up then then you've got to figure out what the compatibility is\nBecause you don't want to you know she doesn't want us to do that every single time\nIt's complicated isn't [laughter] by the give those things to try and then from now on get that T shirt that says no\nI Will not fix your computer why it Muncie valley Pennsylvania hell why it\n[noise] [noise] Hi how
