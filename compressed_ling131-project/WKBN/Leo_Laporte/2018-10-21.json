X. box and upper bedrooms and the second floor they don't like any more they used to like yeah but what it's called this a or B there is no but I just said that question about\nI use I don't I you know a speed test is one way to do it but there are some really good why analysis tools out there for windows like insider with two S's that will help you there's one called ... analyzed and it's free on the Microsoft Store\nUm net cuts is another one get one of these that spot as a ... kind of cool because ... spot\nWill actually let you make survey the house so you can wander around with a laptop it'll make heat maps saying we're ... best and weakest and so you may learn more what you want to make sure is that you're on the best band the five ... and by the way this is something that mesh routers do that people may not be aware of [noise]\nThey may look at this that or be might be doing this it might look at the different devices and and say you know in order to give the best performance to let's say the guy in the living room watching Netflix\nI'm going to give lower performance the laptops that only need email so it may be shape but doing what we called bandwidth shaping as well depending on the device that's one of the things uh that is a new in these ... and the or be as one of them\nSo that's another thing to be aware of\nUm I maybe insiders not the best choices when I use but it's it's it's expensive\nBut uh I'll tell you what I'll put a a list\nOf all the different tools that are out there for why fight analysis that will help you better understand you put that on your Dell and that will help you better understand it also tell you whether you're getting all the bands you may not said del may maybe only on two point four bigger hurts in which case thirty would be great [noise]\nOkay so that's another thing like that yeah yeah well thank you\nThanks for thanks for calling I appreciate it it ... it used to be you could really measure your bandwidth ah and it would be the same on all the devices but now with these mesh routers it absolutely is in the case that's but that's what they're doing what they're supposed to do which is\nGive each to each the bandwidth it deserves it needs from each according to their\nWhat is it the communist manifesto anyway it's a [laughter] from each according to their abilities to each according to their needs something like that ...\nIt's you know honestly networking\nIs something very advanced\nWe're doing it now we're all becoming network grooves in the home because we have switches and routers and you know all sorts of stuff\nBut honestly I mean a ... if you can find an IT professional\nWho is a wife I grew a wizard\nHe's worth his weight and go we have one\nOr we have a very challenging wife I environment the studio twenty employees\nAre numerous virtual lands you know one we have one dedicated to on air staff so that they can get the best performance\nOne dedicated to guess uh but we also have a you know multiple why fight devices probably hundreds in this space and so he's a Russell who's our genius or local genius has set us up with rockets are which are enterprise grade\nThose are the ones you'll see in theaters in and ships and in hotels rock has a routers and each room has its own and it's he spends a lot of the time we can that so in order to get you know the best possible\nWhy fight you could be a it could be it can take some real skills those wife I analyzes the heat map tool especially will will help you out a little bit help you get an idea of what's going on we get amazing performance here because we we have a\nA ten ... bit fiber connection to the Internet now shared among a\nLot of people in a lot of the vices but that's a lot of bandwidth ten

the [noise]\nYeah it sound bar is a is a convenience more than great audio you know that I mean ideally you'd have for but who has ... space for this uh you'd have a left right center channel so that's three speakers in the front you'd have a sub woofer although many sand bars now come with some were first and then\nTo get the full surround sound you have to speakers kind of a at your ear distance from the TV left and right as the surrounds and then some people even have at mostly about port firing speakers they have a rare surrounds that go behind you\nOr depends how serious you are about your sound\nIt sounds great because TVs generally come with awful sound those videos you the sound on that right it sounds like birth of her ... her yeah it's\nVery it's very flat in the in my

given some really good deal so so yeah content or TV\nI remember I here's the deal and Comcast if you will because we're Comcast also if you go into\nThe office because they have offices are often they're like storefronts and up and talk to the human or ...\nOr you can often get a great deal they have wonderful offers but the trick is the only uh you know work for the first year\nAnd then all of a sudden you build doubles so the trick and I asked I asked the woman she said yeah we we always have something just keep coming back before the before the years out ask for the new deal yeah so

fish ... I Love that ... that you can talk to about ... that's\n... that is a nice feature yeah Comcast is working hard with the ex one system so we're to compete with you know really what is a threat to their business model which is people like you court cutters so they they they want to make sure they're offering something for that extra hundred twenty bucks\nAnyways the other day you know from the Internet for every other day I woke up and no Internet\nConnection do you do you go to a browser and wanted to activate right ... ... the cable right if you will not afterward I have an air is a such a surfboard sixty one forty one ... bucks plus three\nIs that is that that yours or that that one the Comcast provided you have your own\nYes it's my job I like those Eris so here's what here's the way this all works or the cable company sends us say say they spend a little signal down to the modem to activate it\nAh and you can I think you found that there is a website where you press a button and supposedly it does that yeah but if that doesn't\nKids don't you want to build your own PC [laughter] but that's how you learned right you you know I really David all this stuff makes sense to me because I've done it a million times I Know exactly where what you're going through\nAnd um it's kind of you know and just a pain you gotta keep going through it do you have do you ride Harley says well\nNo no I Know but it's like that isn't it like your own my own personal highly um well\nI uh I don't know what else to do you know bad capacitors would have the same\nThing and that was a problem for a while but I think those have been pretty much solved as well\nUm [noise] boy I you know you ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "21"}
