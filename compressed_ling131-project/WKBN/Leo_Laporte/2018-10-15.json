they are getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits at that faster oh and some devices require not everything has wife five okay so that's kind of normal to provide that\nOkay you have a Jack you have a Jack and what we call an ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nWithout that what I ... yes yes that's exactly right thank you for that\nYes okay that's called ethernet that's uh that's always nice you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nThey throw in the shack I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nFloyd I'm In the ... so that's the question as the landlord ... thank you for throwing in they'll jak which is connected to nothing [laughter] I thought that was to you ask them do you provide\nInternet access almost certainly they don't I mean it's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space that that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that his wired the ... the place up in in by Internet from them\nOK okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my I'm a start up company so do you think it would be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away is not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have we in our building for instance the studio I'm In right now\nWe have the local cable company wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local is fiber optic Internet service provider called sonic that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say this one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which ... what am I choices if the spectrum you can add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise] usually\nCable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections that homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nOr do you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and uh and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was been what is available to me on that jak you put in my office and then\nI bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said you know what we're going to pay all the tendons Internet access most likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would do some research to see what business Internet costs and what you get what event happen\nIs they'll wired up they may or may not come into your office in wired up probably what they'll do is if you've got an eastern jak in your office they'll just what they do they call it light it up\nThey'll connect it in that closet there's all those ethernet jacks go into that closet and they'll connect that line in your office to the one that's coming into the building into the closet they'll connect those now you're on that company's Internet\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is buy a wife fire router\nDocument that was gonna say Chili's we did that\nAnd and I found a company that was wired into their ... with that necessarily feed the why fight that there are\nNo that are free oh they offer you free why fine\nFor unlimited device\nNice that I is it from who's it from sick curiosities it from the company that the red sea the building or\nYou know what it is that company puts it in the contract it stopped\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an inside office cell or not I'm On the outer\nWall what does that and it caused the problem is well\nMaybe maybe not you should go in there with a phone or laptop and you see what you get and how fast it is go to a you know go to DSL reports dot com on your laptop and choose their speed test and see what you're getting yeah tell", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo
