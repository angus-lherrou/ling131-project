C. P. E. R. dot com because they do something kind of old fashioned they have a hardware leader board they call it based on their reviews\nIf you is that right at the top on the page PC per dot com\nIt's a hardware leader board it's ... they have a four different systems you can build starting with a forty fifty three dollar low end system and all the way up to two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollar dream system and they list there don't don't tell your kid yet but they list there all the parts you are going to need you need a case you know the mother board you need a processor\nNeed a video card you need memory\nYou need storage your hard drive you may or may not want to get a sound card depending on you know the mother board will have a sound card in the network are most of the time\nYou need to get a power supply case usually has the power supply built in so they it on their on these on the leader board they say well foreign fifty three dollars here's what you should get for two thousand eight hundred fifty dollars here's what you should get\nAnd uh\nIt's a great way so get the kids don't tell me about this yet maybe if you have trouble finding it but say what what do we need to make a PC and these can learn a lot and then okay let's choose the parts because you know how much do you have to spend how much you want to spend on the process or on the memory and much

great and I don't think it's a scam I think it's fine\nUh so that's Facebook and Google but then there are things like these survey sites and the the trick and I think I emphasize with dawn is they're they're gonna get something in return they're either going to get your attention\nYour time and that's what advertisers want your attention right or maybe they're going to get your email address your home address something that they can use and sell your email address is valuable because they can sell it to other people who send you\nSpam you know offers\nFor a thin line between offers and spam [noise] ah so that's valuable so what I suggested to dawn and I would reiterate is make a email address is not your main address that you used just for stuff like this spam at Yahoo dot com or something like that or stuff I don't want edgy male dot com that's those are probably taken but you get the idea\nAnd then you you need access to that account because a lot of times or the very first thing they lose verify that address and you'll have to go and click ... ... email ... so that's that's fine\nJust understand that you're trading your time you're probably going to be looking at some ads that kind of thing and maybe you're going to get some money out of it\nA couple of people are chat room people I Know and respect like scooter X and ... say they like ... dot com P. E. R. K. dot com and you know you it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time and if you do enough of that they make money because they can charge the advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back\nWell of course you're getting one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side and they're making money too that's a win win you know that's great doesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention\nSo it's important to understand and if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game\nAnd this is this this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life are now in a\nIn the Internet world and they're ... what's funny is that the same games\nThey're the same games they're just change the Nigerian prince scam things like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a whole bunch of new ways to play the game there's a wonderful book that I highly recommend\nAre called the confidence game why we fall for it every time [laughter] by a a a wonderful woman named Maria ... Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game it's a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to the old cons\nRe is a fascinating a person she's actually a become a poker champion she's writing a new book about up high stakes poker\nIn order to do that [laughter] [noise] she's a become a poker chat and she's brilliant\nBrilliant but her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of\nUnderstand I'm sure that's been accepted magazines you could probably find it on my ... parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the sting or there I'd love I Love con men a lot of great movies and books about Conn but they're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new\nKind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing your greed something for nothing so that's the that's the alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell in general things like the pigeon drop\nRequire in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast and I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent\nBut if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever\nThey're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run will take your money\nBut the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful fun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to sell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google\nWe get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram they're all free well but there's something there there's a way they're making money because they're not free for the guys who run those companies is expensive so what are they making how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free\nBut [laughter] that's only because we have fabulous advertisers now I'm really careful we pick ads that advertisers that are products that use in like so I don't

zones dancers the dunes there's did the see there is ... villages the atlas mountains I'm just ... amazing variety amazing\nAmazing photography and I brought a hat\nYou were in ... where they apparently invented the says\nI was in ... that I bought of course a fed [laughter] and uh as as we do a review of the a hat assignment all today that's why I thought I'd where it's perfect to honoring the assignment shift so these assignments so generally or monthly\nOther because Chris has been out on assignment we uh we have been we're a little behind but people submit pictures of in this case hat illustrating the concept pat and Chris picks three to take a look at and you've got three for us today\nI Do I went through the pictures things every one for a handing them in and I made a choice of three different hat related pictures the first one is by Gregory Chesney yeah and\nIt has a title kind of a title old school ducks Jay pig [laughter] well that's not the cameras name for sure so no he he he ... he gave it a name that Jay peg you probably know part of the name anyway um yeah what are we looking at we're looking at a black and white photo of\nSome mask that has a ... you can see the front of a baseball hats\nOn it but it's all very out of focus very artsy very ... it looks like it's probably been taken with a ... whole or with a with a lens baby or some weird lens that but I kinda liked it it it this is not about the photo being sharp and focused Crispin\nColorful and contrast ... this is about the feeling that this conveys and looks like it's been shot on film there's scratches on its\nUm books yeah looks looks just it just feels right it's really interesting it's perfect for dia de Los ... west us which is coming up which like prior to believe that mask related to that yeah [noise] so every it touches on the hat a thing just by having this\nYou know nowadays you look at something and you say well that could be a pinhole camera or it could have been taken with a regular camera and then filtered process [noise]\nThe way this this works jail metric Klee with the depths of different different things in different different\nSo do I do think it's probably a on a lark I think is probably not a a digital filter needs\nWill say anyway I agree what else we have here well second one is by a user ... goal news G. A. U. N. I. S.\nUm doesn't have a proper titles and Chris Lamb wrote that in there that I Do not like I went through it all the pictures up one of the flick or the other day I made sure they all had titles just because you're\nGood yes yes I'm so it's yeah what are we looking at looking at a little tugboat all sorts um but it's not just about it has a face an ad on\nI have no idea why you see it or you just obviously you've never seen\nIt's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I'm not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show oh it's from Thomas the tank I think so yeah\nIt ... it does it does it it probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here\nBut it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and one look at face it's cute as a hat on so um I think it's a fun boat I like\nIt to your door to see there is but it anytime there's Texas the picture I just make that the name of the picture so\nThey that's what I Do I'm you know that's\nThat's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making\nTitles up your photos yeah think simple if Texas in the photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is\nOn the photo something very clear is on the photo that's the subject of the photo then make that the title like I did in the next picture all his bowl and has a photo of a pink hats and he called the photo pink cat\nIt's that simple out so\nA good one too I this is this is a bowl\nThink this is a very pink cat I likely to end it there there are several\nReasons why first of all it's totally clear what this is about it's a big cat um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff going on in the background in like a reception of some sort of people they are talking to each other but it it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that's that is is about because it's in focus and the rest of our focus [noise] um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat whereas a green dress or at least some greening address a green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of look like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion but in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but stuff that's on hats you know [laughter] um yeah I like it it it jumped at me because the crystal clear the color is a bright\nAnd it was just a little cheerful photo of a hat I like it too it's like ... or something some event\nLooks looks like high class you\nKnow he has a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our says I I think it is a really classy I like\nAs I Love them and they're perfect for TV 'cause they have no brim\nSo they don't block the light they don't put a shadow and you're right very good and less you have to ... make me think of the Maltese falcon uh-huh yeah yep [noise]\nSo I Do have a new assignment oh good yeah the new Simon while we are at accessories and clothing items\nUm the next one is glasses now when you say glasses are do you mean spectacles or do you argue intentionally ambiguous\nNo of course I Am a being a big us as everyone make make up your own mind glasses can mean a lot of\nIt could be anything you want it to be but take a picture illustrating the word or concept glasses\nAnd uh the way we participate it's there's no price here this is not really a contest it's just it really to get you out there taking pictures the way you can participate is take a picture take many pictures that doesn't it doesn't have to be a fancy phone does have to be anything special at all\nWhich is I think more convenient and then there's a monthly subscription usually less than ten dollars a month or so all told much less expensive so if you can't get this working there are some very good consumer options out there that I Would recommend\nOutdoor cameras a nest it makes outdoor cameras I have to invest outdoor cameras that worked quite well from a nest dot com and then I'm a ring also makes outdoor cameras have lights on them that can come on and so you can see everything that's going on all of them work at night so you're saying her camera\nShe is she's seeing what what is what is what is going wrong it's not recording it's not she's not seeing video what's going wrong\nSo for some reason it um I think the video was in coming up it was a ... a long time ago some time last year that there was some kind of an air methods popping up and\nShe's going to get it pointed her mobile app honestly I Would just throw it all out or try to sell it on ... and get in this camp [noise] I'm so much cheaper\nI ... at any effort you spend any ... what\nIs this guy going to cost you know to fix it it seems like a lot of work um and and frankly not as convenient solution the DVR solution is the old way of doing this just recording locally\nUm so I Would I honestly that's what I Would do there's and that's coming out during his campaign two hundred dollars\nHigh definition or does need why fi access because it's it's connected to the Internet via wife find the nest has a website you can go and see what's going on at any time or you can see previous you you can get alerts on your smartphone\nInstead of having a TV set up with the DVR she's using her phone I'm I'm a it's hard for me to diagnose what's going on with the cameras at this point because I don't really understand the question\nWell the thing is that she had a mobile app for it and I'm just like I don't know all the details to it but I'm basically that question as if I get to DVR replace\nAdult replacing the DVR and please\n[laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution I I think she's got a uh she should write the whole thing off\nA the camera records to a DVR via some cable that she's got attached to the cameras that comes into the business is that it [noise]\nYeah and it's all connected on I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to you it remotely\n[noise] so I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up and be able to see what they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on a nap\nOver the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere [noise] um is there is is it a privacy concern or is it a cost concern\nAll the above\nOkay um I think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the first costs a I think it's it's considerably more for to be very spent more money on this thing than you will spend over you know\nFive years on a mess of the picture is going to be better I just don't know\nThe brand that she has a I'm not sure he again what you know name\nYeah sure what you're trying to do you say you you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the era message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seeing the video is that the problem\nYeah Ali hook up to it because it has an H M I advocate for ... hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV to me so because that you are without work anymore was getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the error was\nHGF my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know displaced so I'm thinking that might be something wrong with the H ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out believe you're going to spend more money trying to figure\nOut what's wrong and you're going to get a sub optimal solution anyway and it's going to break again um there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com or they don't have outdoor cameras\nThat a wise cam which is the least expensive but I've got these wise camps everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to nest dot com\nGet a ... they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video it is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and she needs somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras they also say nest camp outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred sixty five dollars from Amazon that's you know that's going to be less than than fixing that DVR\nAnd you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what it is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well I'll give you an example\nWe were um [noise] we were in Japan or last spring and I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened at a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car ring or doorbell all night she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was a\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\n\nTalk to her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record of that I Can't tell you how useful it is I have several outdoor cameras a we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio\nAnd it's and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a ... a camcorder and the wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording in looping over and over again all of this is completely\nObsolete uh I think it's just nutty just to just to\nPut any more money into it because I can guarantee is going to cost you more than a getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have

better access [noise]\nUm so so you said with the edge rather X that's just one device\nRoute or all the white yeah then you need for why fi access points right ah and you put them in bridge mode and they each have their own discreet Internet basically so it's creating for virtual networks\n[noise] okay so that's probably the\nThat's the most secure fastest way to do it um and then it's more expensive because you got to buy for access points but if you're just buying why fi access point you're not using them as routers you can get less expensive ones probably under a hundred dollars that are just why fight [noise]\nOkay um and so another thought I had was just just putting it in and letting attendance decide if they're worried about the security\nThat's the other option routers yeah\nYeah that's the other option they can absolutely secure at themselves in other ways yeah [noise]\nUm [noise] so I guess\nHere's here's one thing you might you you you kind of do want to be aware but one of the things he has read her ex will do it for you is give you an idea of who's using how much bandwidth what are the issues that can come up is at one of them is using so much bandwidth nobody else can get on line\nRight\nSo that would have that a dish and you have a lot of metrics from the edge router that will give you an idea of how much bandwidth each each ten minutes using\n[noise] um I also have one comment on the previous caller sure of ... yeah um I've done a lot of cameras dolls and I ...

[noise] ask\nLeo the phone number back to the phones we go and line one Daniel in Long Beach\nHi Daniel yeah I mean a little I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make let's get that clear okay are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am\nNow to get what ... what are the minimum ... all the different languages like what are\nThe you want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal\nI'm thinking about maybe something on the site so in the early\nDays of the Web or a Web page and actually still true today when you actually look at this what they call the source code of the Web page a Web page\nIs composed of a couple of different things HTML\nWhich stands for hypertext markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text should be a Talib size this tech should be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML\nAh yes yes that was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credible it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website is you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we pushed it all together you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in a text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nAre CSS style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use a programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language that all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as is the HTML CSS\nAnd the data and by the way the data's usually stored in a data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design a day you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you designed\nA interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used ... came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because for years job a script was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will then be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with go or ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write in job a script but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time he'd like to say yeah I think it would be ... by the way a great skill [noise]\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing java scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those the other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the\nContent is stored and the third part and often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web design if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you\nThe third part is design you need to learn design you need to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only\nHow it looks but how people use it and we spent a court I'll give you an example here

I. T.\nDot TV the company that designed this is in Austin they're called for kitchens they had a designer was a graphic specialist he helped choose the ... designed the logos the lay out things like that they had a programmer actually that three or four programmers who did the job of script and the CSS\nThey have we have a database that is a back and written in a in a totally different content management system you're going to hear this term a lot too and Web design C.
