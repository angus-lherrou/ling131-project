{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Big deal [noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on Android and are there in the early days\n[noise] uh you know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you\nThis will depend very much much Android they have Samsung's for instance have owner and owner info section that when the phone is locked will scroll across the song and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happen you'll notice there's medical information\nIn there and then you\nCan also a set ice emergency contacts I think that's their by default and stamps on phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the lock screen message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing else\nPut a a contact phone number because of that as I said the first responders that's the thing they tell me that they and if you're a first responder uh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really want is that emergency contact number\nSo at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a phone number and people will know what that means the first responders will know\nAnd if you don't have that feature the one last thing you can do and this is true of any phone you know you have a lock screen image the thing that shows up you can use it as a photo editor without lock screened image it puts them information they're\nNow remember everybody available to everybody will be able to see that but ah so you you know consider that but uh almost ... almost ... screen imaging at the very least you could do you know in just if you do I see that's in case of emergency people know what that means and then a\nPhone number that's getting Ninety percent of the way their\nLawyers that person was ...\nI should just do my friends to get an iPhone\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well I'm a I Wish every I don't know you know Andrei the problem is Android is not unlike Iowa is not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone it's summer I\nWas somewhat I was at an amusement park and older coaster and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call I thought well maybe this is my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls from this phone wow and I said oh my God no I just had it in my pocket you know I must\nHave done that I'm so sorry he's the co pay [laughter] she goes are you on the intimidate or I Do yes I Am she goes oh good our GPS [laughter]\nThey knew exactly where you were and you know they probably are going down the hill it's scary\nEnough you could have had a heart attack on that thing I maybe they maybe [laughter] maybe they knew yeah they are yeah I boy I'm you're exactly right tell everybody you know and everybody in your men's group\nThat is a very especially as we get to a certain age that's a very important thing to have on there is you're in case of emergency information [noise]\nUh but unfortunately with Android phones there's no single way to do it as so Samsung phones do have a way and other phones if you at least in the lock screen put it in a large screen message or on the screen as a as text\nWhy should it takes a lot\nMy pleasure I'm a look here's somebody saying [noise]\nUh I'm oh look on my pixel phone which is kind of the default um Android phone\nTo me saying that they also have an ice entry under contacts some of the search for I see you know all I'm getting is ice cream stores [laughter]\nThat's not going to help my heart health [laughter] yeah\nWhat is really a great idea because we all know have phones are in our pockets all the time I'm In a it's a good thing just remember if you do put it on the lock screen message or edit the photo boxing a photo with a phone number\nThat anybody can see that I don't know I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing but that's the case or should they brought you by speaking of emergencies carbon I the there's a phone number you

fairly recently um on\nVirtual reality and pain management current trends in future directions that does describe because we don't really understand the mechanism why this would work\nBut it's very much being studied and with some success and the question is what it is what's off or are they using how are they doing it and how does it work and this ah this this article\nI think you'll find a little more informative a than a newspaper article about this um\nCalled the ... the use of it at least yeah it does is it occupies the line is such a way it and at the same time transfer page signals to the ... yeah\n[noise] so they they they mentioned in his in his scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nOr this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques is biofeedback you know deep breathing with stuff that we know is already worked but using VR a or B R plus hypnosis VR plus breathing exercises seem to have some\nSome results I've also seen V. are used in treatment of Pete TST post traumatic stress disorder and that seems to also be a affective\nI you know I always would caution VR is the hottest thing in technology today and so it always caution a little bit um you know when it's the the the flavor of the month that you know there's\nBut it does it is very interesting I I see the the uh the article that you're referring to\n'em and it's certainly a lot better than opioids an opioid addiction but you're right the getting getting getting that are getting that software is an interesting challenge and\nMy guess is that none of these techniques work without a doctor president you know it's not something you could take home and and do 'em uh there's also an article on plus a scholarly article um\nThe impact of virtual reality and chronic pain I could put that in the show to a as well so there's there's a lot of studies on this and they sleep they seem to agree that it does help\nBut you know almost anything helps [laughter] I think if I if\nIt's not just the flavor the ... because they mention hunter Hofmann Lewis evidently a VR pioneer\nYeah a punch to study back
