P. S. C. censor which is a large censored but not full framed full frame gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want\nBut I think this is the de thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four seven the lands that goes with the kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is D.

the map from the phone to the I had no\nI'm looking up the I ... I was a hot spot to remind\nAha so using the ... yet so that's exactly why [noise] so uh this is this is unfortunately and it's not an issue in the phone every iPhone has GPS built in\n... I parents do not unless you get one with a cellular ship in it to sell your ship as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT\nAnd so that's the problem precisely is it the ... the I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the I've had been kind of figure out where you are it's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why fight you won't know where you are\nA little slow sometimes you missed the terms\nBefore you really yeah we're really at your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS ... pet is not so\nIt does it does the location is actually clever a trick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove ... a lot of cars around with GPS is is that I notice\nWhen I'm Fifteen feet from ... pointe a twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Akron points see I'm here\nIn a mate literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect obviously\nInteresting so if I bought an I ... that has the GPS ... you know little\nTrick is your next type pet and good news apples probably coming out with I had this month for 'em get one within ... chip then you don't have to be I mean you're still going to have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain for a but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and it'll have GPS will be accurate [noise]\nSounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something a ... year it was\nYeah to bed at just the way it is not a problem and the reason is Israel\nIsrael thanks for the call is very simple and the the the chip that apple puts in\nProbably ... was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess it's from into a is a dual purpose chip does GPS and Internet\nOr and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're\nGoing to release I'm almost certain there's lots of evidence that they're going to release new I pass this year probably knew I had pros or remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones this year have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader their face i._d.\nAnd they have new ways of swiping and swooping in looping to control the thing because you don't have a home buttons you swipe up to go home and all that\nAh apple is going to inevitably move everything to the end of the first I think the first step there will be these new I passed it they'll release now we have an event no one knows\nThere's no consensus on this ... are they are also expected to release new Mac or platforms probably not the new Mac Pro but I Know you know we're looking for frankly a\nMac book air in a math book replacement of some kind and uh that would also probably come out new air pods that\nThat there's some evidence that they're they're going to upgrade the air pods yeah a partly because they've been deeply discounted by law to merchants not apple but others that usually means rather clearing them out for the new ones\nSo it's enough new stuff they could have an event but I\nIn my gut is there not it'll just it'll just appeared there'll be a press release\nMost people think it'd be later this month closer to Halloween but if you're in the market for an eye pad it would be prudent at this point ... or ... ... it would be prudent to wait till the end of the month see what apple has to say as usual we have to wait and they don't tell us\nUm let's see here that was a Dave in Sarasota wasn't it yeah now I blew it salmon west covina hello Sam [noise]\nToy Leo come on over I'm well how are you doing good thank you for taking my call on this question though sure um I just picked up ... congratulations on the law but thank you thank you a credible machine or yeah\nUm [noise] peace feel my life so I don't know what the heck I'm going with it [laughter]\nThey won't take long they're not they're not so very different they all have the same heritage you know my\nMy kids are the ones teaching me right now\nOh that must be fun [laughter] fun for them and add a job so old fashioned [laughter] them if they get frustrated [laughter] I guess it's like a a complete turnaround to the other", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "08"}
