these things and get the thing back working and they could\nBut this software exists a S T too and it's only provided the apple stores\nAnd a and a few select authorized apple service providers that under under strict confidentiality in business contracts mandating what parts they use and what they charge apple says is to protect you and actually\nThat's believable it's credible it is to protect you but it has the very real side effects of\nKeeping people from preparing their stuff\nApple for instance you know there are a lot of iPhone repair companies out there aren't there a but apple won't sell them parts\nSo they have to get parts from old iPhones or a third parties and their as you probably remember that the fingerprint readers\nOn iPhones if the screen was replaced it involves replacing the fingerprint reader and there was a fairly significant apple problem a bug where if that had happened\nTo the ... the phone wouldn't run anymore apple said oh no that was a bug we didn't mean that when they get when it happened and fix it\nBut they really don't like third party repair shops\n\nThey use secret tool kits both software and hardware they make special machines it goes way back to the beginning Steve Jobs didn't want anybody to get into a Macintosh so used proprietary torture screws you had to have a special Turks screwdriver uh unfortunately\nThat was easy to do ... and people were able to get into their ... pretty quickly but Steve didn't want you to get in there I mean really they and they got more and more\nAdamant about that and you couldn't make the case it was about security at that time they just want to they just want to keep the repairs to themselves\n[noise] so I fix it to their credit did they were just risk display replacement on one of the new twenty Eighteen ... pros with such bar to see if they could to\nRent it normally and after they replaced the screen it did run fine so if apple has this capability seems like they do they haven't yet pushed it and the reason I bring it up\nIs not to not to do some sensationalistic thing saying oh apples going to keep her from prepared repairing it but just to let you know and maybe let encourage you to lead apple know that this would be a problem\nIf they do many state legislatures I Can't remember things twenty states are looking at rights to repair legislation to protect your right to repair stuff you own\nTo make sure that companies offer you manuals and parts if you go to repair dot org\n... you can find that information if you Google right to repair you'll find a wired magazine article that came out last month\nJohn Deere just caused farmers swindled farmers out of their right to repair it says in wired magazine a lot of companies make a lot of money on repairs\nBut shouldn't you be allowed to fix your own stuff after all you on it right it's a very it's an interesting debate and a\nAnd I I Hope that apple I would like to encourage apple to make third party repairs possible because apple often doesn't want to fix stuff you remember our caller last hour who had three IMAX fry on him and what apple said as well we'll have to replace the whole mother board at six hundred dollars\nMaybe that's true or maybe there was some small part that could easily be fixed but apple doesn't want to get in their ...\nThey don't want to do that and a lot of companies nowadays that's how it works is all modular replacement\nWhich makes it expensive and incidentally encourages you to buy a new iMac which this guy did write repaired out or if you want to learn more about the rights to repair and which states and\nIt's a lot of them now wow it's almost every state wow [noise] ah ... have have legislation a along these lines\n\n... and ... you probably should let

always works as an ass number does and it's a got a red light on the powers which says I'm not working\nOh and so it doesn't have to do with the network it's just an ass stopped working yeah but ... the yeah the red light telling you I don't think the red light has to do with a network it sounds like it has to do with other as\nWell there are a lot of different things but then the red like good tell ya the manual they need more light confined\nIn order to know what it is you have to log on to the dashboard or what you can do is I can you\nCan you connect uh let's see what could you do hear who makes the gas\nIs a WD it's there when they were there when I was not\nMy favorite a company in the world\nUm western digital but we should do is to find these terms real quickly western digital makes something called a lot of companies make these network attached storage it's basically a full computer but it has to be a special attributes mainly lots of drives and lots of store just wear western digital is in the business that sells drives\nBut it also lacks a computer screen or a keyboard or a mouse it but it you connected to your network and then you\nYou're going to get on it by a logging in from some other computer on the network and usually it's used for data storage whether it's back up serving movies and music are but there are other things in asking do I use my asked for a lot of things and I love it but I'm not that fond of the western digital how old is it\nIt's less than a year\nThat's really dumb that they put one light on this goes red and they say well if you want to know what it means go to the dashboard well if what it means is my network interfaces died [noise] yeah it's\nOne of the of that has to either net ports yeah so if you had to switch that could do

even at port on it and I had to use the EEO it ended up as a sport though or not yet\n[noise] yeah [noise] well that that that would be one thing or even a desktop and even with a long wire but I Would try connecting directly instead of through the router [noise]\nUm yeah and if you connect and run the dashboard software I Would think it should find the western digital and maybe give you some information on what's wrong I I have seen a western digital masses fail at a higher rate I think than than most yeah\nWell the reason I think this particular western digital 'cause it was supposedly had built built in trans go\nFor your server oh that's neat so as as a server was you know highly recommend it oh yeah that's neat yeah so\nUsually network attach storage devices do have they have processors they have to they're running an operating system and everything but normally they very slow process or so it sounds like western digital said hey it'd be a good thing if we put a faster processor or maybe even a chip designated a D.

windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates

documents folders\nGone oh\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested as as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight you know not has been tested for six months work their tests and the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program you'd think if this thing

to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go under there that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so uh or or worse\nThe cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and a member there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital sooner and stuff the cable companies pretended\nThat this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or\nThere's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more channels et cetera et cetera et cetera\nUh but of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over and over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nBut they do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be challenged\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stuff but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and thought I signal you get the less speed you get the direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has they do to do Lebanese see are you\nHere me I'm Mike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or however you say a decent\nWhy why it's not DSL um it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very rural so the only choice we\nHad oh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend and most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours\nWill ... cable company\nBut if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife by router\nI did I did do that\nOkay good so you ... ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disabled that or at least turn off the wife by radio\nIf you can turn off the wife by radio that'll lemonade signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I read or a movie called bridge boats they let the cable modem router 'cause it's still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well you're\nWay to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers um erode sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from net gear a veil up from is that links is I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things\nAnd these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the audience and then they have some units typically you buy a a a little subject for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might\nTo get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I'm In my brain doesn't work right now I'm working on probably three brain cells\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain and so a lot to make an excuse for it\nDo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but hey\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or is it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it\nLike okay\nSo on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down but on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest way is of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out\nYou know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you precedent hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time\nAnd that'll put you in recovery mode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what that what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it and they're you know just kind of at the same time and volume up and then you have to\nBuy you said volume up in power at the same pile up yeah and you can you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button\nSo power power it all the way down then press the power in volume button together and you'll see you should see on most of these phones they use a text based menu that the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume button up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset and a reset will just to raise the phone take it back as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in awhile\nHid it I did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I haven't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nFor in a perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow\nZero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down a ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook to your writing it right but as long as people aren't going\nTo have to get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up and get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm In the like the targets and stuff they this is I don't know if that's a good idea but I see no books as they pass words\nOn the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but maybe don't have one that says ... get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd anytime you set a code a password whatever\nJust write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep up dating just the apps that came with it right and they only have\nEight gig on eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and only one gig of memory and I'm always getting low memory and out of space memory\nEvery time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes ... or ... I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting them frequently\nYeah so but you do want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a\n... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as the updates done to delete it and not not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost time updates don't add to this amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay\nIt does leave downloaded folder the ... the ... or the update that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically\nOh oh okay yeah I Know windows they always do\nThat oh that's right windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces skin so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to a thirty two gigabytes card\nWell that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see you have a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from your point the three fifty seven the other way FEMA our show they brought you buy carbon I ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "07"}
