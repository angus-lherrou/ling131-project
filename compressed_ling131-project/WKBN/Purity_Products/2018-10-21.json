{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "A couple of years after the say on he was in a really bad\nOur accident he was with his eyes his car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is um morphine and it becomes addicted to morphine and he for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile said\nOn 'em with pike that's the name that comes to\nMy old James Pike up yesterday was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah yeah yeah and\nI think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret to do this and that\nKind of breaking up a ... ah I'm not sure if it's your cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal\nBishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nBut this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and is exciting it is it is not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't\nBelieve that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same answers high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight\nOnly once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to disprove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to do this mistake\nHow all those who lost faith because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my

with us again\nAnd said they were going to talk a little bit about what's been going on economically speaking well if you stay tuned you'll learn about all of those issues and more from a guy who I think is just terrific that explaining the economy was that we won't get me under suspicion of weekend magazine where Dane Davis will be our guest I Know you'll learn a lot here to stay to\nThe Dave is on the end of our line two articles that I was reading just today\nAbout the economy that I Would like you to react to a Alan Greenspan says it's one of the tightest labor markets he's ever seen I think that's good news and another one was the jobless rate is sort of fifty year low talked a little bit of out of date\nOutlook I think that the labor market is improving you know one thing I've always talked about that the most important thing we can do is to have it tight labor market and the reason why is but not\nLabor markets tight that's when you start to get by wages rising benefits and all sorts of improvements um I don't know if you saw your listeners us he'll\nJust ... percent wage increases the workers at US Steel\nOver the next four years so companies will give out better wages when you've got a tight labor market because they're competing to get the best work [laughter] if you want to see a strong middle class we got to get a tight labor market so that's a good thing about what Alan Greenspan said\nAbsolutely so that in that benefits everybody Republicans Democrats male female\nI mean if you got to be a job you can find a better one I mean that that's good news so we're going in the right direction or you were talking about us steel getting fourteen percent raises a which is a good sign for those steel workers talk a little bit about the jobless rate is also add a fifty year alone I mean that's a\nIs a good news for folks out there\nYeah so that race down which is a huge proven and not only the unemployment rate down on the other indicator job openings versus people seeking work so normally there's more people seeking work than dark job openings and about I think two months ago that flip\nNow have more job openings available now people see you work now obviously doesn't mean that you know everything is perfect but that's a great sign a piece for hiring or tried to take on labor\nAnd they're really trying to get skilled workers you know I was a couple of weeks ago I was in a local late in the manufacturing operation really top notch place and I said the biggest problem they have not terrorists are not dying material its workers they have a lot of older baby boomer age workers that are fifties\nExceeds their skill they know how to work the machinery and they don't have young people who can do the jobs to do these you know semi skilled manufacturing jobs they said they get a lot of young people in a twenty will fly\nI Will show up for the interview and only two or three can pass the drug test so you know it's interesting we have a labor market where there's a lot of people out of work\nEthic who can't get into the labor market for what other ... whatever reason whether it's drugs or whether it's you know they don't want to work or that we have an economy that's doing well and the needs more skilled trained labor especially manufacturing\nWhy do you think the economy is doing so well right now one list this economy on fire\nWell I think on the you know the New York times couple of weeks ago has this peace and it's really important that you and your listeners read it about how there was a industrial recession and twenty six\nSo even though the economy was still growing in terms of manufacturing capital investment building new machines all that went into recession at the end of twenty Fifteen guinea a twenty six so I I Know you get a caller said well we're just joined the benefits of the Obama years but that's actually\nNot true when you look into the numbers the manufacturing sector of our economy went into recession twenty we've seen what's changed is the code of vacation of the tax or\nWe start to encourage capital investment we changed the depreciation schedule so that people could invest it can buy new machinery and equipment down and then write it off their taxes we lower the tax rates in I think most crucially for workers we started raising these tariffs and cutting imports from China\nOr from other countries so areas you know we're losing jobs because it's cheap imports now all of a sudden and we've got a little bit of protection to help them stabilized for industries while their workers to breed and became some ground on the waitress so I think a combination of all these factors is really helping to drive the economy\nWhat were your thoughts are we're talking with Sue Davis our economic ... what were your thoughts about a NAFTA finally be renegotiated by the Trump Administration they don't even call it a nap anymore it's USC I made a but it's been totally redone comments about that\nYeah so I think this is a um I don't think this was a home run in my opinion a home run would have been completely scrappy NAFTA\nBut I think this was a solid double\nUm so I think it definitely moves the ball forward for workers and here's what's really crucial that I think is very good not good enough play\nThe new uh NAFTA agreement the U.S see I'm a I think is what they're calling it mandates that workers that Mexico has to get paid six dollars and a half an hour\nNow why is that for why Mexicans are making more money won't because it stops being some town of companies relocating to Mexico\nTo take advantage of lower wage cars and so it sounds just for the first time in the international trade agreement minimum wages in other countries in these third world developing countries which prevents companies from relocate you ultimately it's a good thing if they're making more\nBecause companies aren't going to be shutting down factories here relocating them in Mexico and taking advantage of the cheap labor so that is I think very important benefit potentially could we to the relocating in the inside or seen an automobile manufacturing in the United states and the other key thing I don't think it's enough appreciation\nOr is the fact that this is going to be revisited every six years so now after when it was passed that was that it was done\nAnd it just stayed that way well now there's a pause that opens and invites\nYou know disagree agreement to be revisited every six years so this isn't good enough to start pushing back manufacturing in the United states we have an opportunity in six years to push for more changes so it's an incremental reform it's not the slam dunk that I Would want it to be but I think it is a big big movement in the right direction\nAnd is and it's a huge step I mean because other of presidents both Republican and Democrat didn't see the issue at all they didn't do anything about this issue\nI don't know if that's because the lobbyists or I don't know if that's just because they were of a fearful of and who knows what the cost of cost of it really was what these guys with the top administration finally did something about it a step in the right direction now\nDo you think the Trump search with a hardcore approach you know we're going to put put tariffs on you were going to do this we're going to do that to ultimately bring people to the table to ultimately get them to negotiate and come up with a deal attend the better interest of the United states\nYeah I Do I think and the other thing I think he does that this is crucial if she's not afraid to alienate are allies are so called outlet for example the European Union United States is currently in major trade negotiations with the European Union in what brought them to the table one and it's just exactly\nWhat you said was he said OK if you don't come to the table I'm going to put twenty five percent terrorists\nOn German auto exports which are crucial for the European economy uh Germany is really the lynchpin of the entire European industrial system so he said I'm going to put twenty five percent auto imports and Mercedes Audi a BMW and the light and it's\nBringing them to the table we'll see if an agreement made but I think you know I I give the guy credit\nBecause he's willing to risk personal embarrassment\nOr to force our allies are so called allies Canada Mexico the European Japan to the table to get a better deal for the United states I think that's crucial I think a lot of presidents\nJust wanted to let the system right you know it's one thing an election year they were promised they look at these agreements and then when it came time to actually you know put money on the table they would just whenever the negotiators negotiate that's what they would sign so yeah I I agree with you\nAnd he did the same thing when you were you were talking in a previous interview you were saying you did the same thing when it came to them paying two per cent of the G A GDP until you go right to I mean he did he didn't care what they thought of him personally saying you guys have been living up to your obligations",
