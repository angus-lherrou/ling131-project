I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know do something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um sell you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future on Halloween how do you see in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ... us no good question you know I think that um you know\nThe Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nRace with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids left just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and ask them for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go you know where you\nGot like holographic oh you've got you got to sit here and that's usually the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin ran origins of Halloween we're going to a asking about this part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to this day in my county ... and ... tonight\nNever missed a beat to want to show or a good sign up for the coasts email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\n[noise]\nSix o'clock shop um American Stores were fine hardware their brothers song you tend to you this is news radio\nThat a couple of three weeks ago I got this from one of my mentors and the veterans treatment court\nHe never says much but he's a good guy he sent me something about the polling Canfield junior league softball you'd never I never heard nothing about it in the paper well OK program was ... and all the teams that are composed of ten Thirteen and fourteen year old girls\nSeven girls from Poland three from Canfield defeated west\nPort Smith Thirteen that nothing and sixteen that nothing in the Ohio State championship went undefeated into regional tournament in ...

talk about\nUh the local mission that you do every year let's first start by how long is or how long have you done this local mission when did it start in what was the motivation [noise] well we started our mission\nYears ago and uh as most of you know um my husband Fortunato and I have done international missions dating back to Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd a one time we were on the way home from Guatemala and we weren't going to Guatemala using recycled hearing aids that people here in the valley had donated\nA paying them forward you know recycling them giving them to children and adults who would never have the opportunity to to hear well again or or have a hearing aid [noise] and we started thinking you know there's there's a need right here in our own back yard\nAnd we know that there are people that are on a Medicaid that will help\nWith hearing aids but there are people here locally that just fall through the cracks and we said you know what we've we've got to help here right in our own backyard and so that's kind of what sparked it seven years later\nUm we have gifted two hundred a little over two hundred and fifty people\nFree hearing aids here in the valley so this year we're going to do another one in December\nA for those of you listening that don't know about it we take applications we do screen everybody financially because in order to be able to do this we have to make sure we're helping the right people folks who are truly and financial need\nAnd so we have a special hotlines set up to take applications [noise]\nUm we have a if you qualify going over the screening on the phone and you can come in and fill out a written application it's very detailed we get into your finances so you have to be comfortable with that and financially if you qualify in December you will receive you're hearing aids\nAre they new hearing aids\nMost all of them I'm going to tell you Ninety percent of them are brand new some are recycled oh why is that well there are some people that don't meet the financial needs for whatever reason\nThey truly are just a little above poverty level\nBut we still want to help them so we partner with another foundation and um the foundation that we partner with has very strict requirements for those those financial cut off for people who are just a little bit above it we have some wonderful wonderful reconditioned\nHearing aids and people are very accepting um you know they're they're clean we're not we're not giving them something that's dirty by any means and I I used the analogy that\nIf you said to me you know Cheryl I I really want to work for you but I Lived ten miles away and I can't afford a car to get there but boy I Wish I could\nAnd I said you know here's an old car it's in great shape you can use it to get to work and have a job and then you're going to save money and in some day you can buy your own car right a better one a newer one something that you know that you wish to have\nI don't think that's a bad thing I I sometimes think that people are more invested when they know that we're giving them a hand up you know something to make\nThem succeed to get a better job or to go back to school or whatever it might be\nA couple of a couple of things that I Want to talk about the first of all this was a local militia did you say your was your numbers sufferings of I hear the correct yes your number seven All right for\nThem to talk a little bit so I Know that for my daughter's sorority bill to save those as a fundraising for\nShuttering or as well [noise] I forget the name of the company somehow you have a connection with them\nYes that is a foundation that we partner with and it's so coincidental that you brought that up because you probably know this Friday they're having a big fundraiser downtown\nOn a called hits for hearing and said don't do the ... is a sorority that most all colleges have across the country\nAnd they raise money for people who are in need who need help with their hearing\nSo they to partner with this same foundation and raise money for this same foundation or an exceptional organization and ah we're joining them friday to raise money for this turkey foundation downtown will be working downtown with the delta zeta\nI'm and I'm hoping that some of the ... are going to come volunteer at our local mission so that we have a more volunteers more help I Hope it's going to be a bigger and better mission than we've ever had [noise]\nRight and uh just just to cover this I mean this is all of the local measures for people as you say\nThat are truly needed not people would say well I have the money I just don't want to spend it on a hearing aid that don't your your doesn't work like that these are new hearing aids them for the most parts that are that are given to people to reach the criteria state of the yard urinary it's\nA book on people and that doesn't surprise me doctor for a hundred degrees or other people or some might be a little bit over the requirements you still want to help them anyway and that's where there maybe you can do that with a recycled a hearing aid if you will which makes me want to remind people that if somebody in your household\nPasses away that has hearing aids don't throw him out I mean I I ... I think to myself you know if I could convince even message on a more regular basis to people don't throw them out\nVery you guys accept them bring them to any of the Centers for hearing locations you guys accept them\nAnd you use them clean memory cycle on you and your missions out of this country as well as helping some people who don't qualify or if you will in our country I just want to make sure I got a point writer emphasize that to work through our listeners or don't want them to just let them sort of in a drawer or throw amounts\nRight we use everything even if they're not working and\nYou know I Would say each office gets a donation at least once a week of hearing aids that are either our patients or someone else or people that have just heard that we do this even from other states they'll just walk in and say I know this is the place I bought my aunt's hearing aid she passed away\nUm it's just a fantastic fantastic a recycling a green projects right if they're just sitting in the drawer why not use them I even had a patient tell me he put his in his will he said\nMy daughter I'm asked me what do I want to do with my hearing aids if I pass away and I told her that your foundation will get them he said but I have to tell you I Want them to stay here locally", "show_name": "Purity Products", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "07"}
