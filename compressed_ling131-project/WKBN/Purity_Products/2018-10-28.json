weekend magazine on this I heard media station\nWe spend a lot of talk lately as far as job opportunities are concerns Anna ... weekend magazine we're going to talk about local company that's just looking for\nSome applicants that I wanted you to know about that's always good news\nHey have you seen as far as the employment situation is concerned for the first time in a long time we have more job openings than we do unemployed people granted I mean you always got to say to yourself there are some people have their own worst enemies but are unemployed and will continue to be unemployed because they can't pass a drug test or\nThey just don't have a good work history here they won't show up to work or whatever but for the first time in a long time more job opportunities and we have\nUnemployed people that means labors and demand that also means wages should be going up as well as the ability to leave a job that might not be one that you like to try to find a better job than what you're going to find that if you're coming up here with Chris Allen is that there are great opportunities that are going on white here locally ads our Rick\nAnd said job opportunities that are a career\nAnd a lot of people think the answer is always go to college and get a degree and more and more the answer seems to be instead of depending what you go for I mean if you want to be a doctor or a pharmacist or something along those lines something where you need a degree to get a decent paying job that might be the answer but this idea that all kids should be going to college it was a mistake\nAnd a lot of the good paying jobs are in the Trade Center are in factories in factories have changed over the years a lot more automation lot more computer things that are going on there takes a lot more skill and you can pick up those skills that vocational school or at mc\nTc tc tc uh and when you're an adult the vocational schools as an adult\nWell we thought we would share some of the opportunities are going on out at ... weekend magazine I miss I heart radio station plus getting underway here you're looking\nFor some work you're looking for a job well Chris Alex got the answers for you he came to the right place\n[laughter] mine for as well that ... they're used for salmon last time I saw him I was at Akron children's hospital\nMoaning value are manning the phone banks are you recovered from that but a little bit not recover from you though there you go but the good news says they're really good news is anytime ... sits in that chair in the studio\nHe is bringing job opportunities that he announces to our community and that's what\nI get excited about quite frankly job opportunities with one of our major employers in our community right that is correct ... in a much talk a little bit about its ah let's talk about the openings that you guys\nHave currently going but first I Want people to know Valerie is up and running twenty four hours a day seven days a week when he four hours a day seven days a week one melt shop to pipe mills in his reading the ban shale shale is back strong writes yes it is and\nWhat I mean you know I think is Valerie ... star I think of one of our major employers that pays decent pay decent benefits it's not a job it's really a career\nWould you agree with that and that's that's exactly how we frame it or if you're going to come in you're going to pursue employment with us You're you're going there for a career and not just a job right but\nYou will be able to make a living you'll be able to make a comfortable living and support your family I mean this is what you is this your reputation in this community\nIt is um we are considering one of the premier employers in the area we offered top benefits we offered top pay a entry pay for us uh in the mills in Nineteen twenty five an hour uh-huh um then that's entry Perry yes and I think that's pretty competitive comparatively speaking\nUm you know just on the drive over here you look all over the place everybody is looking for people um if you want something that's going to pay you well and give you a experience and a career\nOr give you opportunities past when you come in as a we are the place to\nGo one of the things I got to tell you guys that I admire about Chris ... is is that you've taken a\nGenuine interest in motivating young people in our community to kind of guide them in the ... in in the right direction and say listen and this is what I I I genuinely admire by your listen college is for some and the\nCollege degrees are expensive you can oh a lot of money and it's for some but there is another path that that you bring to people's attention there\nIs an alternative um manufacturing ah getting some experience getting your hands dirty or understanding how things work\nHow the process is work and oh by the way if you get a job at the right employer a lot of times those employers will pay for you to go to school yeah one of those uh you'd come in USO show some aspiration you stay for a while you create your career\nI'm In there then there's opportunities past that\nBut so in essence if you still are focused that you want to go to college\nOr or get a college degree you could still do that obviously but the question becomes you know if a well it becomes something that you can do but it also is you don't have that big debt behind somebody else's state is paying for that and I want people to understand that because\nThat's one of the things one I've interviewed Chris Allen in the past that I think needs to be out there I mean because Chris is on the forefront of hiring to say\nWe need people that have a certain set of skills and the work that we have has changed\nDramatically over the years and I'm going to get into all of that and I'm going to get in a\nCircle on first talk about social work because the ... the the days of ... in a slot be over the type of jobs you're talking about require some degree of expertise and training they're not like the old days and I want you to elaborate on that for me I always\nSay that there there is no buddy and the mills anymore shoveling coal into a furnace that doesn't work that way\nLot of what we do is automated\nBecause of the nature of the how the operation works it's dangerous\nUm so a lot of or even your your operator positions
