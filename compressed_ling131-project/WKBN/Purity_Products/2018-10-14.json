suggests to be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react uh I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience\nAs science has been part of that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people are going to be travels he explained to ... the brain argue make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth that has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class and I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how the go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught\nAny more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to the minds\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main\nGoal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration\nIt's not just about walking\nWalking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah higher self with are multi dimensional self night\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being said just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nThat sounds great information on your website and let's say by the way in Asheville in town in southern or and there are ... resources on there\nAnd I and I found this is a clean ways that you can take yourself into an ... and you want to go do that there are\nLots of great things really any talking on a second survey results the um based on your sixteen thousand\nA hundred and eighty five responses you can't really came out with the um common reported phenomena associated with out of body experience is very interesting so\nThe average of what people go through which is fantastic and you oh this is free on the site which I think great that you really help and give the information freely so people can\nPractice that especially if you have something going on in your life a problem on illness\nYou can connect to your own answers can you connect with people\nThat that our loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\n[noise] well you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual is open to

[noise] every medium we'll give you a second hand information filtered through their own mind [noise]\nWell it's interesting 'cause you can also self edit but we will talk about that in a second and

get more info out here in the near future on that but we'd love to have you know let's get over to Loretta read a few months ago you were here and you talked about a movie um fortunately I wasn't able to make the debut you had here in ... I was out of town\nBut now you got another one and I don't know how you find these people are ... ... people go but boy you're\nBringing a lot of the ... a lot of things into the commuter the movie is the oath the Michael ... strength story but boy who wanted to be president and Loretta uh and I laughed\nA little bit when she said he was important in that state so he couldn't uh become a a president but rather give us a little background on a much sergeant Michael strike\nOkay um yeah I'm very excited that we're able to bring this to town and not just the movie but the filmmaker will also be here but Michael strength was or strong as it would have been set in a Slovakia\nI was born in Slovakia Nineteen Nineteen I Believe it was\nCame to the United states um his father came here because conditions were so bad in what would be Slovakia and he became a coal miner in Pennsylvania and Michael was brought up in Johnstown PA so not not very far from here\nHis sister as a matter of fact still lives in Johnstown area and she's interviewed in this movie that I'm Talking about\nSo anyway he went to high school in Johnstown graduated from high school shortly after he enlisted in the marine corps and it's it's kind of interesting because\nBirthday was November ... tense and November ... is the anniversary of the founding of the marine corps so I don't know maybe that's why he chose the marine corps to enlist in\nBut a long story short I he was hoping when the war started World War two started that he would get sent back to Europe to help free his country or his homeland or from the Nazis or the Pacific\nTheater instead and he originally spent two months or in the battle at ... I spent two months there contracted malaria came back to the states uh went back to the Pacific theater ended up in a regime ...\nAnd was one of the six men as a matter of fact that's sergeant he was the leader of the six man troupe that raised the uh second slack on ... the one that's famous for the the photograph and the monument that was made from it so I Do ... who debts who's the filmmaker\nAnd that's a gentleman we had on yeah last time you were\nHere correct he's the guy saint saint filmmaker his his specialty is the world war two Arab because as he said uh there's not too many left from it and we're having\nThat's some less every day so he wants to make these programs so that their stories aren't forgotten\nThat he did the movie about the freeing of Slovakia ...\nAh well the one that he was here for was about the U.S airmen who were shot down over yes yes shot down over Slovakia or they were flying out of Italy\nAnd it was it was a fascinating story again one that neither people here or in Slovakia really knew much about and I remember you ask them how Comey waited Seventy years after the fact to be making these movies and he says well you got to remember\nThey were under communism\nFor most of that time and you didn't say nice things about what the slow vox did for the Americans are the Americans did for the slow vox so he's trying to do this stuff now\nTo use the new domain me no no I'm not [laughter] [laughter] oh\nNo but what I'm Americans did for Slovakia or slow slow vox did for Americans and they did they saved quite a few lives are so anyway so he started making this movie at the end up nine to ... to pass in Fifteen that would have been a real long time to make the movie and\nThe Slovak version was actually finished a about a year and a half ago but it took this long to get the English version at the Slovak embassy on November eighth since my organization which is the American Slovak cultural association of them a hunting valley\nWe've supported his efforts in both of these films monetary early you know do ... could you come back to Youngstown to show your new movie\nAnd I finally got an email from him last week saying\nAh yes that they set the date for November aid for DC and he would be able to come up and could we have him on the tenth or the eleventh and the details are not all hammered out\nIt will be that weekend we're still looking for where it's going to be shown somewhere here in Youngstown area and he'll be present to talk about it\nYou know I haven't heard from you but when I Do you always have such a a bang up thing here like this and when when I got the message from you a few days ago I thought wow this is you know and it's only a month away it doesn't seem to\nMe it seems like a long way I Know in order to get people to be able to to to change their schedules and get things together you got to do it right or a month or so out right and we'll we'll definitely ah I'd love to have him back on on the air and\nI'm sure he would he would like to be on the air again because he really I mean he came\nThis this movie here was filmed in Slovakia in where Michael Strong family came from where he was born he traveled to I'm a marine raiders a convention out in California He's talked to a Marines who fought with Michael Strong\nSo I mean he really puts a total all out effort into making these films of his\nYou know ... it's great that he does that but boy that's gotta be\nExpensive\nI'm sure it is and he his\nAs a matter of fact this time this movie he uh worked with basically a the Slovak version of PBS their public television or to help with the funding and their cultural center in the Slovak government also help support\nHim with this kind of work so and then he sends letters to people\nI mean hey [laughter] you need we need some more\nMoney and especially for the English version you know it was easy to get funding over there for the Slovak version they're not as willing to give money for the English version\nSo you know ... which was kind of I I\nLike this because I'm not a real history buff for war war too but I Do know a little bit and these are stories that\nProbably would never be told if someone like like him didn't just take the time and and go after the information in and put it on film\nExactly and I you know everybody knows he was you know they know the the picture of the flag raising and everything Michael Strunk never made it off he ... he was killed three days later I'm and his troop was\nKind of caught in the so twenty five years old he was he was gone never made it back to the states he was originally buried on ... uh eventually his body was brought back and he's buried at Arlington National cemetery now I'm\n... and like I said a Mr few debts interviewed Marines who were with him he fought in booth and ville and any regime uh\nHe's interviewed his sister who like I said still lives in the Johnstown area friends who went to high school with him he he does a really bang up job on he like he said he wants to give the human story not just the facts and figures\nYou know what what I find interesting and this is he's taken and there's other film a subject and did it and this film the subject is a young man who came from Slovakia to the United states became a marine\nI Will definitely definitely ... and I'm sure he would love to talk to you again\nA best of luck with this and and your other endeavors here in the valley uh this is your moderator J. P. Brown's third saying good day and thanks for listening\nTo John John ... jumping off point the forty one percent the new ABC News Washington Post poll indicates his approval is at its second highest level since he became president but what does it mean for the midterms\nI'm across however held an eleven pointed vantage\nIn house races among registered voters a democratic advantage showing a wide gender gap women registered to vote support Democrats by nearly sixty percent to just under forty percent for Republicans white men are more evenly split with two percent more ...

Johnson\nIs on the in my line obviously in Somerville tile obviously a comedy in a county Republican Party chairman when we went talked about trade\nNAFTA it didn't matter to you whether it was a Republican or Democrat it didn't matter you were you were upset with how the country was going on this and how we are being represented correct\nYou better Ron I'm back in that day\nWhen we were fighting now after a Jim Traficant was ah the congressmen in this district and I had an open lying to the gym or on these trade matters that I could got Jim wants to the floor of the Congress\nScreaming at the top of his lungs were offering certain companies like little company back in his district Somerville tile\nThat was being kicked in the groin\nAfter having invested millions of dollars in the state of the art technology\nManufacturing facilities we still couldn't compete with Mexico for example and of course the today it's China Today it's it's a Southeast Asia there's there's titled factories in in Vietnam today exporting tile to America\nI'm saying the kids to do on the phone yesterday the trade a tariffs and so forth are all almost too late for America because they've already killed most of the ceramic tile industry in America must ... domestic market\nTalk a little bit about how when these trade deals started Dave where your company was how many employees you had and what happened over this period of time that you did it was ignored by Democrats and Republicans\nI can tell you pre NAFTA\nWhen some of those tiles was at its peak having been started in Nineteen twelve by my grandfather by by the Nineteen nineties Nineteen eighties some go ahead or three times factories\nWhere you had those Eighteen distribution centers across the country we had to claim mines and cement plant some not making the mortars and ... that that feed into to installing tile seven hundred and fifty employees company wide\nUm post the NAFTA imposed WTO and coast all the host of trade agreements that were in acted\nIn by Republicans and Democrats they all signed onto them NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton mhm and but I blamed both parties but after that to this point in time I have about a hundred and forty employees and one child factory\nAnd I am fighting to save those jobs\nIt as a ... ... if you think you can compete with decent wages I I'd like to pay my employees double what I'm paying but it but the reality of it is the industry that we're in\nThe pay healthcare to pay pension plans to pay five weeks paid vacation\nJury pay funeral pay perfect attendance pay disability insurance if someone gets sick and knock related even to work and has to have time off we have coverage warm if you think my competitors in Mexico have that or in China\nI have visited there factories and visited those companies\nAnd and they don't\nAnd that's why they've devoured again I can only speak are very knowledgeable about the ceramic tile industry but it's the same and all kinds of other manufacturing industry look at every town on this I grew up in Salem Salem used to have probably ten or twelve major companies\nThe gambling pumped company there for a hundred and something years hundreds of Employees International producer bumps they're gone\nElectric furnace of mere shell of what they were sexually industry is one of the major tooling guy industries to supply the the automotive industry out of business they ended up going over and building a factory in China and in and they actually that died because of that they probably still all there\nAre trade secrets and patents\nSo we'd go for the first time\nWe've got a president that's gone into Washington and kicked all of them as Jim Traficant used to say kicked off and light and the growing and I say all of them all the senators and congressmen of both parties who've sold out America as industrial base\nAnd ... and ... used to take in your case and the effect it's had on your on your community and all of these other cases and basically over the years you sell on deaf ears you would hear the sympathy that's too bad well do something about it but nothing ever happened through\nYour thing ever happened I sat and Senator Warner ditches office in ... and he was in tears my father I went to Washington I was asked to speak for produce ceramic tile industry and testify in Washington and I had a time voted which brought us into his office and he said don't tell me your story\nThen we told them with the some of those story we we're just build a new factory down in North Carolina open the doors of Nineteen Ninety at that time imports into the U.S were forty percent of the U.S market\nOr thinking was is look we need to get the most modern facility possible the lowest labor content the most sophisticated ... there were fifty computers on the production line to walk and say we're the employees ... technicians to run equipment all robotics\nWithin ten years of that brand new spank a modern factory imports have gone from forty percent of the market to eighty five percent of the market\nWas it that they had better technology near plans or did they just have less technology and cheaper labor\nThey had the same technology but none of the regulatory environment none of the ... they have all kinds of government subsidies and even when you're dealing with with Mexico and China they're oligarchs those same people that run the country would run the government own most of the assets of those countries\nAnd and you just can't compete with them\nSo they would be dumping products in your taste tile into the country and selling it's less than what it would cost you to manufacture\nThey were selling it in half of what our costs were and they are today you can go to Home Depot today and you can buy ceramic tile for fifty cents a square foot mhm and you can't make it for that in the United states with the best equipment\nAnd you would do I get folks this is true a year after year after year the Democrats and Republicans and absolutely sympathy you listening to him and they would do nothing and this man on my phone line would go there a lot of concern for his company but also a lot of concerns for the employees that had been gentle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "14"}
