twelve state he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidates specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always have a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read a lot can lots of money for the party he's raised over Seventy million dollars on\nThem for the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates have cuts he certainly doesn't need it he's not running again and keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of\nJust well you know basically like a skate a day on multiple districts and\nIt just go kind of on his final sprint that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nJeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members that as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his ...\nYeah I thought this is really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and did that for a been a darn it has to be there for the truck conservative fire rate\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually sunk legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough um Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass anything and they can do right now on their own um\nBut they need to buy in from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they started voting bloc and they've done and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus states not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nOr speak with allies Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates do kind of messaging well he does or does it change from Canada to Canada\nSo it works from candidate a candidate what he'll do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off under Republican leadership I'm at the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely um groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tons and tons of tiny little bells all grouped together is a lot of vulnerable Republicans have their names on those bills\nAnd painting and all of that but the message basically being\nYou're better off under Republican leadership and Democrats\n... they say are going further and further left\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nI imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist you said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere\nRanked team and none of them are counted out but these districts where the Democrat is making a big strong place it's probably not\nShe can just tricks to align yourself really closely with the president in last year doing an event with just the Republican base but right sort of more of a moderating force he um obviously the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney and\nSo he comes in he doesn't illicit really strong feelings from either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial because President Trump so it seems that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to soften the Republican Party image and

Newman this piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um how easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly that are there any sanctions on us\nWe are going to respond with what they say the words were greater action and you know I think they're clearly referring to a oil prices so they hatch people it within Saudi Arabia sugar speaking on behalf of the ruling family they're saying you know we can only do prices right now west Texas crude is around Seventy dollars\nAre they are saying we could easily just restrict supply and prices go up to eighty dollars a hundred dollars um you know the Saudis are are still the biggest oil producer in the world and they could\nThey could easily restrict supply enough to push oil prices almost as high as they want to so when they do that um I you know I\n... it's hard it is really kind of head scratching because it's a little bit hard to see this outbreak of sort of oil petroleum warfare to ah when all these countries really do need each other I mean ... the shot Saudi Arabia I mean the United states\nUh United States does me Saudi oil even though we produce a lot more of our own oil they used to so I you know as we've seen that so many times that so many different ways\nI mean middle Middle Eastern politics it's so complicated ah in in large part because of cells oil and he'll be in jail\nFor ...

two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza Collins got the scoop was what do we know\nHe has a really aggressive final sprint he's like he's going to twelve state he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbents who currently serve with him a handful are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidate specifically like the person trying to take his seat because he's retiring\nWould you keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he asked to read lots and lots of money for the party he's raised over seven eight million dollars I'm\nNot for the party with a lot of that going to keep these candidates safer attempt to keep these candidates have because he certainly doesn't need it he's not running again I'm keeping aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of just you know basically like a skate a day on\nMultiple districts and\nIt just go kind of on his final spent that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help is like the if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nJeez are so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members and as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his ...\nYeah I thought this is really interesting as well I've spent the last couple of years covering the Freedom Caucus and did that for a been a thorn in his head the there for a trip\nConservative fire raid members of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually send legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough um Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass\nAnything and they can do that right now on their\nOwn um but they need dying from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they sort of voting bloc and they've done that and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus is not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSpeak with allies that Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help

places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be closed her fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off and a Republican leadership on the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on the eighth tons and tons of tiny little bells all grouped together is a lot\nOf vulnerable Republicans have their names on those bells and painting and all of that but the message basically being you're better off at a Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey say are going further and further can\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist you said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere rent payments that none of them are counted out\nBut these districts where the Democrat\nIs and they can't take strong place it's probably not\nShe comes just tricks to align yourself really closely with the president can last year doing an event with just the Republican base but right sort of more\nOf a moderating force the obviously the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney and so he comes in he doesn't illicit really strong feelings\nFrom either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial because President Trump so it seems that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to soften the Republican Party image and actually stay on message about the economy and that sort of thing\nThere's a lot of allies are calling USA Today congressional reporter", "show_name": "This Morning With
