be ma'am it may be and uh there was interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming you heard the facts I read last night about the piece that broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment\nOr somebody worried [laughter] it is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off have you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is new break off ... and you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is why is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or a piece that breaks off\nThere should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that
