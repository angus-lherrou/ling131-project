for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is lurk at this to the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that's a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be a paper than ah it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nHum with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a center that than it has been in the past\nAnd I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates are negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual or if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing above price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of these more expensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver\nA New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on it are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high um but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war as and cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices downward a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program is brought you buy Brooklyn in did you know the Brooklyn in sheets

labeled money ends it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend to know how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural district because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural district\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know\nTeachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticing fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you were shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started\nWhen they when they were all five days if they were already feet in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and\nIt's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always a big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer\nLike a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap day care and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals to those nonprofits there in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal that child might be getting\nYou know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts you use it for a day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but didn't they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's not let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um

their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment uh alternatives and starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit for he's a he sees the terrorists from both sides so um he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment\nBut he also favors the terrorists because she competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China so the price of competing product is going to go up\nA and he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him rage his own prices eventually him pay for the higher cost keys and himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the way that plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as simple as some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\n[noise] it's a I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases their pay either a ten percent tariff now an additional temperature works on the twenty five percent ... also the steel and aluminum\nTariffs on a flight and not just to import from China but from most countries show are imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier\nA price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ... percent so they need to pay ten percent more for that product and at some point he's going to have to raise his own prices\nAh in order to cover that increasing costs but\nYou know there if you're if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well as my customers are going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without sending my customers away\nSo what he plans to do is he going to eat the addict cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also and he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's going to raise prices so ah all prices will kind of go up at the same time\nWe're sticking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the terrorists\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about this she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before he got the notification from his own supplier that his own costs are going up\nBy the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn a because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact um I got notified by my own fired the my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the Trump terrorists are in one of the coin team made is that it his business he has seen a lot of the U.S businesses small businesses such as oh just\nDisappear because ah they cannot compete with\nA with cheap imported products from China and in many cases they make the case that the imported products are low quality products that there\nAre there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consider you're getting something inferior but a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products\nSo he's one of these people who feels that the Trump parents may actually rectify a long standing problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThanks correct that's Yahoo Finance columnist strict Newman's\nPortion of the program is ... by Harry's you've heard Gordon talked for years about and how much he loves Harry is not just for him that's where his dad and

cover for just three bucks plus free shipping one\nShe came across as bold and charismatic and authoritarian um I think it just varies it it's true generally that women have tended to be more humble in the past because of their upbringing and their experience in the workplace they face obstacles that men don't\nAnd again that do humble buses work across all industries\n[noise] good question um increasingly they do is more industries become infused by technology and I just in time management rapid change it's becoming more valuable in all industries\nSue Shellenbarger the wall Street Journal

mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is because this to the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere at four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that is a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger I even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as an adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a shift for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the extra than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful and slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nHum with that said though I think we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense that it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below a where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing above price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go out and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted um for for a bidding war as in cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for buyers who want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices downward a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nPortion of the program is brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know the Brooklyn in sheets are named the winner of the best of online

schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend now how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we um I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC [noise] and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far [noise]\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural district because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out [noise]\nAnd um so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as pure absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day\nIt just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already feet in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nKnow how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours [laughter] the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather
