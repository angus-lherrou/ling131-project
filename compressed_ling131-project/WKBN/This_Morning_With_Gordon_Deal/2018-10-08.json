report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com work what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country for Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a in a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment and our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this is a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strains from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets ... of course those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the are hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a widow or we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with Mark Emmert senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report um\nDoes the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one uh that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI fit as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good places well with it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working on so [noise] um\nFor the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left I\nThink the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go or\nThe you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does that extend to another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nOf but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impact of the tax cut begin to fade and ...\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch when that happens to

is\nDrawing crowds for a political events a larger than anybody has ever seen in a state in Austin be at a concert with the national true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's campaign but the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people\nAnd Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that are as we know from twenty sixteen the last election tend not to show up in numbers proportionate to their share of the population really admit trouble elections were in turn out a goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so\nAh the ... campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they will have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did and too late or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twice sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence hurting our data to show that that's going to be the case\nAnd it was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a bachelor of the country and get twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of Hispanics voted Republican for twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are showing gerrymandered too many Democrats has passed on them and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for all races or you know and so that the general elections have been a cakewalk for one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive\nStatewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a political machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course last year and a half a and whether there'll be able to do it\nUh in time for November six of the big question\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's come and ask for a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the taxes the big state uh and some of these counties are very small uh some of the county is that\nIt is that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C and campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was visiting counties a inch having more people show up is to see him then voted in the twenties sixteen election in those counties\nUh and so he thinks that he's able to draw\nA people who haven't participated before because there's been little reason to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things he says on the campaign trail that you know in ... Texas is a red state for the non voting state or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is his house district in El Paso or having voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the campaign trail has drawn enormous numbers of people\nUh the evidence that he can get the bishop at the polls\nIs not grounded in in his own history a his house district as one of the twenty twenty lowest turnout districts in the country and twenty six came in and quite fourteen only about Seventy thousand people voted in the general election in his house district out of seven hundred thousand people in the district\nMust read Wall Street journal national political reporter Reid Epstein is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning America First news [noise]\nLet alone the same state unless of course you're talking about Michigan Michigan's business friendly practices help them become a leader in industries that range from\nAgriculture in cyber security chew aerospace and advanced manufacturing in fact Michigan is ranked among the top ten states for a major new and expanded facilities which makes Michigan more than business friendly it makes Michigan business smart to learn more visit Michigan business dot org\nThinking about life insurance what if\nThey October re what's new today on the ... radio a radio\nIs perfect for decorating the house or just setting the dairy move our spicy ... has killed tracks with labor is why when no after day\nSwing mixture you break out all our great video game ... whether you're at home or the stadium and knew I our Radio Free ... collection\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find your loan them right\nAll today in orange\nFour days you're listening to America's first news\nFind out what business update and it's brought to buy staples staple helps keep your ink stocked and your business moving all year long staples has a huge selection of inking told her so you'll find your ink in stock every time and at a low price everyday staples each pro time\nSometimes a new job turns out not to be the dream job you thought it was but you can't always a board to walk away from a paycheck on west the company pays you to leave\nCNN dot coms there's some companies are making it easier to part ways paying unhappy workers to bow out at the online retailer Zappos new hires are offered a month's salary to leave within three months of starting their position\n... policy is officially called the graceful leave policy but it's more commonly referred to as the offer it's extended about halfway through the four week training program script for three months from the start date some years no one takes the offer so far this year three people\nHave taken the company up on it Amazon piggybacking off the idea from ... which is botch back in two thousand nine offers a similar program called pay to quit once a year workers at its fulfillment centers are offered a chance to leave the company\nThe offers two thousand bucks the first year and goes up by a thousand dollars each year to a max of five brand\nIt's eight minutes in front of the hour on this morning Jennifer\n... is back with more of America's first\nWent into tears of newly wed four sisters from one family and two brothers from another or among the twenty victims when a stretch limousine taking\nPassengers to surprise birthday party crashed in upstate New York the limit charge do a highway intersection without stopping on Saturday afternoon ...

S. fold get some buying an agreement on this is how we should do trade this is how we should be state owned enterprises that we do with the deal with data protections and to try to eventually get China to join that sort of international order\nTrump's approaches I had to put on ... and pound on you until you get in what I Want in the Chinese are going to do to\nMake it might work I don't know we'll talk in ten years but it also might really causing problems [laughter]\nIt's great to Alexander Panetta at Politico it's Nineteen Minutes now after the hour\nMore civil program is once you\nAnd so all these ideas pretty good overall I'd want to talk to who have it like in in that case it could be used against you\nWhich rub rub ... tech writer at USA Today thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWondering what's happening in the valley one person died in a crash I'm Rob fourteen last night the Ohio State highway patrol says a pickup trucks going up both crashed with a tank trunk killing tank truck driver having a state route fourteen and Beloit snowed road young some police that crash happened on Andrew's avenue near Linden avenue into\nCars were racing one of them fish tail both ended up rolling over two people were sent to the hospital after that crash\nYoung some police asked some good clues that could help them find the person broken the beach and Joe's on Canfield road there are surveillance video somebody throwing a tire jak through the window to smash it out and the intruder also cut himself in the broken glass leaving a trail of blood behind\nUS Senator Chuck Schumer demanding more regulations were limos after twenty people were killed in a crash in upstate New York W wreck happened what a Ford Excursion limo failed to stop at an intersection and hit a parked vehicle\nFrom the power Chevrolet do at GMC of cut Ohio newsroom I'm more\nRounds are celebrating a victory Monday after edging the ravens twelve mind\nAnd over time ...

voters than health care and Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you've seen is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November the Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off\nFar more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they thought that says something more for the twenty twenty presidential elections and it's kind of emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have\nSort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policies such as Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crash especially in conservative states that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more a kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate that's playing out right now\nBoy who supports this ah well I'm ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really ... for Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point a gardener um sixteen actually Fifteen co

is saying well all we need to go easy here\nI think it's the um uh individuals like men for example who ran who didn't come out in support of Medicare for all um UC ... people like I'm In West Virginia\nWho are the a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach easy on a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\nStreet with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or business go some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way the the slogan it's do play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask a people voters about Medicare for all the support a strikingly high around Seventy percent but you know the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interest that brings haters plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all its and even among the Democrats\nThere's you know widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare is what the options even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that what was going to hit the road as such goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know it would go so far as to say it's good at running program that I think they they are building on the ... the popularity of Medicare itself which has you know high\nApproval rating some its beneficiaries and because of her as a positive connotation the public and I also think they that they see this a

rally against it I presumed because there'd be less money for them\n[noise] yeah there is that the federal government generally in almost all cases pays a lower reimbursement rate for care\nAnd um
