that the church has with the watchers they taught the secrets of heaven and the secrets of heaven are how humans can transform into angels\nRide the cosmic conduit and dwell is God's throne and that's the really big question right there George why would any why would the church have a problem with this why does the establishment church have a problem with a group of beings coming to earth and teaching humans to become angels you'd think they would walk them that\nYou would think they would welcome at the problem is is that\nYou've cut out the church in this scenario you have no need for

something to is there any evil it all connected with the watchers\nWell there isn't and perception I mean the the the the scenes work absolutely clear and their writings that there are two currents or forces of the watchers one was represented by the arcane journal Michael is also sometimes referred to as milk cheese a duck\nWho is who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member\nOf the other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts\nWe can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility a hunted you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angel and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the Renee sound so it was a belief was developed that the the Sarah from or actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book ... describes the the heavenly thrown a God referred to a sigh on and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and just humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this I'm going well who are these people ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go and do well in God's throne and can I I cannot lie and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise]\nYeah [noise]\nWell I never knew I had margins

on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more

thing with the story of the state of\nLimbo crash that killed twenty people in upstate New York last weekend just seeing the headline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by doctor Judith or law\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nA accidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they\nGo to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and the center yourself and realize that you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's sunny and and I had done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons and the brain for I'm In the past two that's why it's such a an interest in it on the ... and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a state he scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle urine mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\nMm So how do you begin to set boundaries than if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you because you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pass patients has to take notice fast you know not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught of stress a negative news it's just too much for anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature\nMeditate exercise with a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice if past traumas\nUm trigger it for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggered so you have to know that different now because it could make a big difference to know that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation um and also do a lot of self nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news\nNow be able to meditate go outside\nUm learn you know is a complete sentence with paper because then pass don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nYou know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever you have the types of energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll of this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about who just drained your energy\nOr speak with Dr Judah oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's

Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment says either way rival producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nBut I mean this is the case of you know a movie in a store for which you know in retrospect seems like a no brainer big hit of course probably Cooper directing it directly himself as well as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffet business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd we'll probably a lot of success of the ... and he offers and and the road shows\nYeah on the line but we're only about the film and and about the project is that uh there's really not a lot of ... with English with work I mean for one from a studio doubling make these kinds of movies any more movies for grown ups movies that are in about\nFranchising superheroes um for another was a movie that's been made three times before admittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou lose your belt that we make a movie fitting will do well in the past because it's just going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version I again they bumped I Will too so the last three oh sort of conventions liberate the side and um you know and then he ... to ...\nYou know that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done Whelan set that high bar right you do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's the thing that was the last the last few years maybe more than a decade now that that was just ... of course on television as well is that you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do seem to think that would come back but if if you're bringing back the classic\nUh things don't look like ... like maybe uh some beach been kind of a sort of a lesser versions of those earlier booth I say with the man will just do one had is that offer for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies so a lot of people even if they\nAre seeing that movie with Barbara Streisand and Chris Chris christopherson\nA you know it was a long time ago and I also think the world is changing the music world that are this document he's very much about a sort of a Mario Cooper's characters with our country rocker guy with the modern a sort of pop superstar or all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances or the seventies so you know just a simple remake it was a remake I think\nA lot to say about it and was informed to a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post ... the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucks Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway or we were talking off the air I I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of ... near when I saw the\nOver the weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to entertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well let's put that number perspective 'cause that's not really\nYou know they weren't after like a two hundred million dollar opening weekend\nThat's exactly right you know I think the numbers are always funny where we get get gotta get invaded every weekend now well on Monday rather with these box office numbers one weekend but at the highest total and that's not really but sort of\nA state of who should be like anything else or any other financial benchmark\nWe kinda have to go kill lecture you know comparing it to if you made you know a hundred grand in the stock market a share that with that much but but it's been a hundred and fifty thousand or to buy that that's probably not so good whereas if you make ten grand of course and I had always been a thousand that's a pretty good return similar scenario I mean this is a ... budget\nMovies aimed at grown ups are not meant to be this kind of global assault on the box office the uh the fed might be for you after so uh you know the fact that he made forty two point six million when you look at\nYou know how how most of those
