and then people kind of go well no one died there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of

everything's gonna be All right most beautiful in the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional was well they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it's been in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years you know\nSixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative\nAnd it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye saying you know it's okay um\nYou know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process so this phenomenon\nIt could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that

join the Bronx I chose to go ahead\nHey George how are you Joe\nGood\nA friend and I wanted to ask you a question\nThen maybe you relate a story about a full ... seen um [noise]\n... um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between the ghostly a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to wake communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had\nA full reparation experience uh after my brother passed away um I shouldn't get songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song not related destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise] um\n[noise] he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital I'm short of 'em\nAnd I it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and\nHe speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the war um can you may be elaborate on what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or who he was\nHe a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA it's a ... before you have the extra maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years okay\nAll right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the what we talked about earlier you know without the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check behind the workbench any five pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with a complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd I and when you resonate with something it's not just information it's the visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night\nAnd he has this feeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions\nAnd then they you know wakes up cars finds a dog and\nThat type of thing so you know why there isn't physical communication or

power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose power to force people to come in to testify\nWow so the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee I'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like\nWith the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will

his focus will be and uh you'll have over in the house oversight committee um electric Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd a Jerrold Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a ship has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWhat Republicans hold the house then what happens\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em ... witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch

Democrats to win control the Senate and that the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep a seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um equation that they have to put together [laughter]\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bell weather states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to having all wanted her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance to be hugely important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Denmark another democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights\nVery very uh ... a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it ultimately hurt him if people think the rescue effort hasn't been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance and third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if Democrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total one of those probably gonna have ears on him so that seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how\nThis adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida that kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like Kavanaugh in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\nIt that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm either going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "23"}
