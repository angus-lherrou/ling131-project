what do we have\nWell Dean Heller in twenty six teams that he was Ninety nine percent against Trump uh he uh has been a sort of moderate senator Republican senator from a swing state uh and it was\nKept his distance during the campaign and then even during the first several months of the president's administration Dean Heller stayed away from Trump he opposed to it at a press conference in Las Vegas [noise] uh in June of twenty Seventeen and said he could not support the Republican health care overhaul\nA and shortly after that a guy he got a primary challenger and his his political uh outlook turned it became a big Trump supporter big supporter of the president's a judicial nominees uh and then\nWe saw this weekend in at a rally in Nevada he compared the president can lightest and said everything he touches turns to gold\nShe's right so the primary challenger was from Tarkanian correct\nIt's from Danny Tarkanian uh the son of the famous basketball code right number cherry Tarkanian coach the ah the run rebels that you and I'll be uh his son Danny is uh\nSomething of a perennial candidate and the Vatican's from seven times and and without winning for different offices but he has a base of support in the conservative wing of the Republican Party and he lost the Senate campaign a primary against our last summer with the idea that senator Heller wasn't loyal enough to the president of the president's policies\nAre in almost instantly within a few days we saw Dean Heller react to it by a revealing for the first time that he voted for the president and twenty sixteen something that he ... to that point refused to say out loud and he backed the the second attempt pecking Republican healthcare attempt\nA and then he put himself out front on judges that on the on the tax bill than you'd ... with the president signed last December and since then he's been a\nSort of a big supporter of the party and the president has responded in kind\nOf this weekend was the third trip a but he's made to Nevada to campaign with senator Heller since June a and the senator has clearly made the bet that the way to win re election in twenty Eighteen is uh to be seen as as very tight with the question\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is pieces called Nevada's GOP senator bets on his conversion to Trump is talking about the incumbent Republican Dean Heller are so you you said just sort of began\nIn the primary versus fellow Republican Danny Tarkanian then uh it's continued now in the general election against a congresswoman Jackie rose and the Democrat\nWell Jacky Rosen is a democratic member of Congress running against Dean Heller ah and she is making the argument that Dean Heller a has no principle of his own she's called him senator spineless and TV ads or\nWherever Dean Heller holds events a Jacky Rosen campaign shows up with one of those sort of inflatable two men like you said a car dealership with a sort of a big way they are a flag around in the wind\nThat they are essentially suggesting that our trips in the wind and that he uh has changed his mind on a number of all the the most ... most critical health care to suit
