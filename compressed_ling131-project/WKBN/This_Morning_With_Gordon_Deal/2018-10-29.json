doesn't\nReally talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you leave and tell yourself you're going to remember your dreams on so I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down I'm as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is a first for me from volcano California the caller is Brennan got good morning Brennan\nMorning on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so I keep having these episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little tidbit I'm suffers from insomnia so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep so to the second day very well it seems like after about five or six\nDays of this but I get on this trip we're falling asleep on my body is falling asleep in my my mind's away I guess they costly process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always being that I see and usually are trying to get me and call me out of my body and not only that\nI can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious what your thoughts are on is this just hallucinate it you know my solution eighty and like\nYour Internet or wicked PTO was saying that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't want to say teleport but you know something along that lines into that it is very scary actually yeah yeah yeah right at all I think I Would call you\nRented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Brandon for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete yeah there\nThere is a category of sleep per hour from there are there are things that happen when people are falling asleep waking up in the sleep for our thing is it's scary ... is a very common you know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so you know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of the spiritual realities or maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a sort of aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume made you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um you know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when the\nUh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a dropping this and some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts and so you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's ... times to the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that that technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they you know consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their protocol here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these also the private and private companies are I think it really taking a close eye on these types of facts just\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber [noise]\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski you know it took Eighteen years to track down how where he was of course in those packages for of course spread out over a much longer period of time in the one that we're talking about here but I Do

have several years of the time and gave you that in order to\nUm you know or to figure out a way to not use Facebook nearly as much the next time around\nUm you know among the shape of Facebook strategy and that was going to be a lot of mobile first and it's going to be a lot of direct and Schumer\nWhich means a lot of tech cost a lot of emails and a lot of other channels that we don't outlive don't even know about yet and\nSo mobile first is not exactly a breakthrough technology this these days what are they going to do something different\n[laughter] well the main thing that they're doing which is a little bit different it is that they're using text messaging but the way that you're you're going to be able to do it is new but the growth of peer to peer ... which basically allows\nYou to a text message people with out them ever having to opt ten\nAnd you've seen this off collection cycle that surge worked at the at least a hundred million Texans just being sent and just this year to watch them I imagine it's going to be several several times that\nI'm for the ... election and one of the ah one of the main people involved in the ... election but we actually had the cofounder of the biggest protecting company on the white\n... how are they indicated how they might use Facebook differently this time 'cause you said they're still spending money there right\nYeah actually there were among the biggest spenders even though they are up for reelection for ... years there among the biggest political centers and I'm sure right now while but um we had a we had a group of a data scientist at NYU\nBut I've been studying this issue they went through and analyze the ad and they're not about messaging that not about the mid term even are these ads are about prompting users to give them their cell phone number stick it bend their email addresses that way they can contact people off line so\nIn a way they're basically spending all this money now so they can contact them off the top on later now people stole ours as long as people still use Facebook\nThey are probably going to stop spending money on it\nBut there's also a deep distrust of the plot for among conservative some people said that the you know the concerns raised a little bit of a people crying wolf they don't really believe it but I can tell you from people that I talked to him but the

little a shame that you would look like you're a political interest at a country but you know in terms of America that is not really concerned I think they said we're not going to I'm not getting the

correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method or the funding\nThat cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts um strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take\nYou know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can in these cases his swat them down and say we're not going to take them what it would ever that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we are going to let that stand [noise]\nSo that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now seems like a good time and it's like well\nYeah in other words the court gets um what's the number of the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those and the cases it takes her either an important national\nIssues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court to the level right below the Supreme Court [noise] uh and they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often\nSplit I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue and one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now\nDo not reflect those kinds of circuits which the court can easily say I'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they're directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stand Supreme Court just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious\nTo eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything but it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say uh we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another let's say because it's often the

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to put a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that sort of the the the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise] you know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically\nA package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing [noise]\nUm but you know the good news is any package that's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's ultimately a lot of times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail through the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through\n'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know it's just the value is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the last and last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these also the private and a private companies are I think it will really taking a close eye on these types of facts just\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a tech
