be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News in particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches\nParticularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um during Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs come over at the Fox business channel until the general public's notice this until have lobbyists MTC and\nLobbyist had found that in effect of way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV programs so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild like ... like a fern what example whose airing what\nWill we took a look at the story now because there is a big fight that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also oppose that\nAre sort of counter messaging to him during the same program\nSays you know to be influenced by them\nFor what we can see if he doesn't gauge sometimes directly after\nAn ad out popped up on TALK on this happened when a group of a U.S steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up the president started talking about the issued suggesting that he had seen the ad um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last year billionaire Tom tire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noticed that and tweeted about it right away\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces gold interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do the ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong dealership um during this administration the viewership has raised and and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some ... from\nYou know noted that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president or also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that the strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president has expressed dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels [laughter] there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him well\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach how he feels like you just suspects at the president's watching and knows he can targeting what's with like a little elbow and the ribs gone to bed\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting to hear the president has been very disparaging of Saturday Night live as\nA show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some evidence that he was watching and groups are also starting to put up ads during Saturday Night live as well\nAs Julie it's Wall Street journal national

A. D. H. radio in ... one of our Philly It's MORNING showing the conditions right now\nHere at home in we'll not bad gusty we've got some gusts twenty of maybe a little over twenty miles an hour maybe twenty five and a few showers but we are on the western side of what is now I have very very big hurricane Michael and the western shine for people who don't watch it is\nIf there is the thing is the good side right so the northeast quadrant of any hurricane or its impact area that's the worst side to be on and the north west side if there is a good side that is the better one in other words the winds fall apart quickly you have less issue with storm surge\nAnd it's just the uh the drier side as well of a storm so we're actually on that side where so many people have come out of the Florida Panhandle to be as close as they came to their homes but still be safe we had seen a day's worth a whole twenty four hours a massive shift to people from Florida Panhandle in the southwest Alabama\nWell do you have the ability to accommodate all those folks\nBut they were full now but but will show figure out areas like Baldwin county which is one of the\nTwo counties that make up our metro area round will be obey they have opened up their coliseum in Baldwin county to take a take it back to ...\nAnd a mobile I Know that I guess I got a report this morning we're pretty getting pretty close to full on hotels here immobile county but uh people probably at that point if we'd do fill up in our area mobile and bought one counties up people will probably continue to go west to the Mississippi coast\nEven though at this point it does look like mobiles going to take a direct hit you do kind of have unique topography right 'cause that mobile bay kind of it it's like a little inlet off of the Gulf Coast is that pose particular flooding problems\nIt can yeah I'm a big and lead for your mobile bay and it it you know it shaped like a so many ... why does it ring towards the southern end of it than it next down as it comes up towards the mobile river comes into the bay and ... and that could give you an issue with surge but once again lucky for us being on the west side\nOr windy she's going to be really bad but north today so each areas to the east of the storm that will get that\nOn short but we saw Gordon Moore the shore quote yesterday as Michael was still further out in the Gulf and we saw\nWater levels three to four feet above normal yesterday and today I have a feeling that will be lower because the storm\nIs now going to be the swing wins from North towards us but you know it's it's eerie being here because waking up this morning I went to bed last night this was a category three yeah to a very significant hurricanes waking up to a category four and wind speeds\nAre very much like a category for that hit mobile back in Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane ... break\nThat absolutely let big areas of mobile involving counties especially ...\nWhen I talked about what it did on the coast and the trees down that's what I worry about on the panhandle storm surge right now obviously a threat to life but also there has not been a significant hurricane in that area\nWhere the Florida Panhandle and long enough that the trees are not what they call waiting for him and I I I'm scared will receive their for damages of ah of trees down further inland trees on houses those issues\nAs we could live this morning with Sean Solomon morning show hosted FM talk one of those six five in Mobile Alabama one of our ... you like a junior meteorologist now the way you're talking about this stuff you ever get tired those like kind of living under the hurricane or tornado threatened that area but\nYeah I don't know I mean do you get tired of a snowstorm says you know in the northeastern ... it's just part of life yeah sure I mean we don't like it and it said when it hit you when it's your time it's set you back and set your life back\nBut it's also you

morning\nWith us we'll come into Wednesday since\nGeorgians went to the polls in twenty sixteen more than half a million voters have been registered including an increase in the voting ranks of women and minorities groups that tend to lean democratic\nMuch of that increase is the result of a change to driver's license forms and acted two years ago in which new applicants and renewables are automatically registered to vote unless they expressly opt out more from Wall Street Journal reporter Kamron McWhorter in Atlanta Campbell is going on\nWell it's a very strange thing because\nRepublicans as a rule don't like these motor voter bills which are bills which\n... which are passed in several states which allow people when they go to register or re read your renewed their driver's license they automatically get registered to vote unless they opt out or say purposely chose to opt out it's what it's done in those states to go out to\nA lot more registration and it's been fought by a lot of Republicans who consider it a a a way to that that could be misused this you know where people who have driver's licenses but aren't necessarily said as soon as somehow end up voting a at a could cause problems\nSo that has been the case in Georgia but about two years ago\nOr the department of drivers services here\nJust made this little change in the document on the advice of their attorney general and I can't get a real straight answer as to why they did it and but what it did was it basically created a motor voter situation in Georgia without passing a bill and so the result is\nThe scene registrations go through the roof here way more than any a\nA voter Dr efforts by democratic leaning groups or anything I mean registrations are way up among all groups African Americans and Asians Hispanics white people to a lesser extent I mean it's really brought out a lot of new voters\nBend the Republican governor signed off on it right\n[laughter] right and again that everyone gets very skittish where I started question as to why they did that but the uh the Democrats and meanwhile the Democrats are\nAre somewhat skittish about it because they want to talk about voter suppression that's one of their talking points and the truth of the matter is if you look at the wrong numbers of people who are\nAbout the possibility of voting in Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased over the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for a particular group that does not equal turn out all the time\nOh exactly so but now the battle becomes current out so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding these bills they say look let's let's just promote ZIP Code all so we'd have more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be\nEngage voters and get them to the polls so and that's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race and torture which is scary and tanks and all the polls indicate extremely close\n... speaking with Wall

Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago Charlie a rambling a bond saw through a southwest in central Florida as a category four\nSo unfortunately the and this was going to drive a massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level I mean can you imagine nine to Thirteen feet of water outside your front door a so you know really if anybody's\nStill along the Florida a Gulf

burden the are are are are there more the comparisons to Florence which struck the Carolinas last month\n[laughter] well you know it's interesting because actually this is probably do some of her as you possibly get to Florence and one of the big differences of course of the intensity or looking at a category for landfall as opposed to Florence spinning down to a category one\nAnd if you remember with Florence was agonizing weeks slow crawl Carolinas that produce the you know the feet of rain and the ethics flooding that occurred for weeks afterwards or what we're seeing what Michael is again it's much more intense\nAnd it's going to accelerate fairly rapidly through a southwest in central Oregon an end of the Carolinas\nOr Thursday on Thursday night and really by this time friday morning it'll be off the east coast in and out of the way so it's moving to the good news is moving quickly but again it's a ferocious Lee intense storm a unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nSeems so a bizarre is the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I'd like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms I'm bud bud why I guess not those area\n[laughter] yeah you would think so I mean I'm I'm I'm looking right now at a at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico and you know there there been a number of them that have hit the Alabama Gulf\nCoast the Mississippi Gulf Coast Louisiana and Texas and South Florida but there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa or through say Appalachian coal and Panama City\nThat has not seen it has not seen a category for landfall and it's sometimes it's just the steering wins the atmosphere that when you get the really intense hurricanes like this\nThey tend to go further south and then further west in the western Gulf of Mexico and not so much hitting the Florida Panhandle Gulf of Mexico or so since it's October the steering which tend to steer it more towards Florida than towards the west or do\nSomething very good hey thanks for sharing a few minutes was

most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News in particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs them over at the Fox business channel until the general public's notice this until have lobbyists in DC and lobbyist\nHave found that effective way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV programs so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild ... like a fern what example whose airing what\nWill we took a look at the story now because there's a big fight to that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also oppose that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see is that he does sometimes directly after\nAn ad that pops up on Fox on\nThis happened to win a group of a steel workers with advertising during Fox and friends in March you know as the ad came up and the president started talking about the issued suggesting that he had seen the ad um and then sort of on the other side here if you remember last\nYear billionaire Tom tire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noticed that and tweeted about it right away\nSpeak with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces gold interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do that ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the program some south have really strong viewership um during this administration the viewership has written and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some lobby from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows but people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president\nHas expressed a dislike for programs on on those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there\nIs that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him well\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach how he feels like you just suspect that the president's watching and knows he can targeting what's with like a little elbow and the ribs gone to bed\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting to hear the president has been a very disparaging of
