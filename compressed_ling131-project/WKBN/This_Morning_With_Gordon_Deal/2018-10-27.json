I'm always thinking among spiritual line here with the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... bridge will be very seriously I'm interested in my book called the ... river Jesus\nYeah I'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or\nLike you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the production of ... ... it was kind of transcribe a written that transcribe by Levi golly we transcribe it from the classic record\nFor no also known as God for book of remembrance of the way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covered like that so called missing years of his life of highly ... ... years or so [laughter]\nBut it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus karma Christ of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ that I'm not a conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers and I've had it with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat really is is is that I'm going to determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes\nI think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise you'll be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time the missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that with that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those books when I'm familiar with recovery ... last year I did want to a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go ask you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier to a different color you\nAre talking about the liar along the lines of it if you you appreciate the freedom we have a we we all worship something you know whether it's money or effects are materialism or whether it's caught him or herself um\nThat we really appreciate that freedom if you if you're if you're cooking works if\nYour way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that is for sure but I have an edge because you know we have this freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a responsibility not correct south individually but could we got a collective we\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared values every\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about each the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and rate or soon to be a a a cans and it's in a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think would hold us together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to young philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think that's what we need to always focus\nOn that's the that's the most important thing to other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the blather but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for\nJumping in an open lines and look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer in history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case\nPolitical make that decision I Want to think a George ...
