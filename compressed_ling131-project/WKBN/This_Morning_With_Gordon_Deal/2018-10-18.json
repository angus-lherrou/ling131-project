Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAnd there are two issues and direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah or some of the state that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and its time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut as you're trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expand Medicaid people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's been some pushback from state officials in some other states and one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative includes a way to\nPay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays for most of the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the cars in Maine which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe government has refused to go along in part because the funding issue so in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative\nTrial how similar or the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main threats as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people to earn enough to hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um [noise] but this is an issue one reason it's still um percolating as an issue in states is there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly rural hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though ... dodge march states are going to find these things and you know across the country [laughter] one argument for why that had happened by mail initiative is there any they're conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe political CARE Act but if their voters say we want this and there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is a key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially they're Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a foreign with health care reporters that he thinks if these initiatives he's found that should as in these states passed that it it could have a trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on\nIs some states that had an expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking the Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that\nAdvocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky okay\nYeah I went to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact on the ballot initiative because governors aren't the only ones in their states that have a say in it they're just in the state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\nBoy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money would be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written but one of the argument that uh opponent of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guarantee the states that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their their argument is that it states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain as funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion ten states you're going to be on there around\n...

limiting their spending according to a new study by bank great dot com the top reason\nAmericans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great right what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending for various reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in what is it otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but it's a reverse the trend where you'd see where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou referenced it in a couple of your remarks there but this is solid economy right to wages are creeping up ah the the tax cut pour more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned that you know growth in household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up at the last few years that was initially when we started looking at five or five years or so ago\nThat was the top ... and people limited they're spending was the cause their incomes weren't going up what we noticed over the past several years though is that as a income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case that was the reason people were holding back and instead people were saying well I'm holding back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that bear watching the percentage of Americans\nA point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent\nWith a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens coupled with rising interest rates are they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then\nWe even an assault economy there's there's there are still those that are\nYou know those ever present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy\nBegan not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows I even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending by generation was that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and the little inclination to save more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so ... and particularly the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... are also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nUh most inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back\nOn their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well I think that's another indicator that\nYou're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce\nStagnant income is still very much an issue\nThat much of this is a recession hanging over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it to say oh what a generation Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nCertainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this\nIn a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about in the past ... millennials have a greater inclination towards saving a they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations\nAnd I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand and the case of voter millennials or\nShe uh the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially formative years has undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different ways you know in this case it's that that focus on saving limiting the spending in order to save more money\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or
