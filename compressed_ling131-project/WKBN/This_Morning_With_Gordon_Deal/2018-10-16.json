you know pretty now at staples ...\nWe plan out for South for those Ninety minutes are up on say anything and I think that's what I Love being able to find every night and there's another thing that happens in a show where\nThey're actually the fan or there's a song that we just playing or van and all you know I think those are the moments that we live for the property rarely\nListen to your heart radio and call your favorite holiday [noise] totally news radio\n\nThat information short on exaggeration you are listening to America's first news this morning with all the extra spending\nTime with is the country's largest retailer\nAt one point Sears has filed for bankruptcy around since Eighteen eighty six that's been around right don't in by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidated the stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise was able to get dumped on the market right in the middle of a holiday season\nThey have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with Toys R us Scott depresses the whole retail market\nSo which ... the lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nRazor wire there but it took on a huge amount of up at five point six billion dollars in debt on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment I couldn't make which is what kind of ...\nUh the chapter eleven filing um they had to wear the opposite so far as all the stores are a place that would not kept up well\nPeople just don't go to the ears anymore and they they lost ... lost to other places as well Home Depot\nAnd various other people took their their market share has been around for a hundred and twenty five years I had a real run out of the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share in two thousand seven down to panic so yeah so it was one of the great American companies to justice\nKeep up with the times what a what could have saved them that say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe there were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively or keeping up stores uh keeping up with the latest fashions are competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores or but it it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployers all the high cost base it would have been hard for them to survive with is very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what are the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now do they sort of live in fear\nI think so I'm In the stores have not been a popular anyway so they don't care about an acre of\nThose places will be re developed\nA maybe from the store maybe for other purposes of gyms and restaurants all kinds of things that come under these if both of 'em so or even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the least space will be repurposed but it's gonna be a big drought a lot of all of them they currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon they're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to all this is probably liquid I I'm all for about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com is known as the\nMoney answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well they're doing in a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf walk up I Know exactly where the cashiers whatsoever so\nUh and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it ... but they're doing it in a much more strategic way with much more limited inventory and select vocation fears just got too big and had too much of a jury of too many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\nThe products are good and and yeah so I think you're going to incredible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all things with the IRS offers yeah so I think people will go out there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers\nWill probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from all the figure stores will\nWe still know the Sears brand than a year five years and no\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example and he left but Iran fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been sober for I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over to our\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\n\nOf program is brought to you by
