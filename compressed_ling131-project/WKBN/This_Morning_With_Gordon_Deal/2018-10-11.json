announcement to resign by the end of the year has sent shockwaves across Washington's foreign policy landscape who will President Trump nominate next Washington Times national security editor guy Taylor\nSays foreign diplomats are already speculating that the president is bent on dating someone who will take his America First agenda toward the United nations to heights that even miss Haley may have blocked that guy what are you hearing\nIt looks as if a President Trump made a kind of a sudden decision this week to accept his resignation because there's\nA there's a desire by John Bolton the national security advisor to try and put a hardliner in this position somebody with a unilateral perspective will push back similar to the way they did but perhaps even harder at the multilateral United Nations and the feeling was administrators shouldn't\nBut if the Democrats win in the mid term shouldn't really take the majority in the Senate it's going to be extremely difficult if not impossible to get such a hard liner a confirmed by the Senate and the ideas get it done now before the end of the year and that's why the battle suddenly move very quickly on Haley\nRight so we've seen a couple of names come to the surface like ah like Nina Powell or Grinnell the answer to Germany right what do we really\nIn terms of serious possibilities those are the two right now\nBeing a powerful I'm sure you know she's ... she's been Sachs banker or the ideas that when she actually under trap as deputy national security advisor during Trump's first year in office but she actually got along really well with Jared Kushner\nAnd uh you know there's a big question however the extent to which John Bolton who came in as national security advisor after Dina power had laughed at the start of twenty eight I'll Remember that worked under a charm McMaster not open\nQuestions about whether that both of them were really accept her up at the un and whether he at\nCornell Cornell is I'm

survivor of Hurricane Katrina New Orleans I Know exactly what these people are going through and one thing that they they never gave you as a survivor of our hurricane with the manual on\nLike this is what you do next and and the thing now is it psychology it making sure that the people do not touch their damage could take those photos\nTake those videos made sure they substantiate everything that was damaged because it will help the insurance process a lot believe me this was the same case in New Orleans we went through this I find myself on a lot of storms not just hurricanes but a flood related storms\nAs a a kind of a social worker going out and talk to people about don't touch that do this here's what you do so this is what's going on right now and and the people make that kind of direction down there\nBut it does the radio station acted as a sort of a sounding board as well\nWe'll take you know we we take a lot of questions and we try to to get involved but we direct uh we're not in the business of really giving expert advice but we do direct the questions inquiries to the proper authorities\nBoy I'm at what point yesterday or what time of day\nDid you say oh boy it's here\n[laughter] um it it became very apparent when the storm made its northeast to return it was on a direct north path to pass it that we thought you know\nWhen it's going to make the turn to the white when is it going to make to turn to the right didn't do that until it was really about maybe fifty miles off the coast line that's when it got the north eastern were really kind of took\nThe white in to uh Mexico beach Appalachian coal in that area the western part of Florida from say deft in West to Pensacola that was spared nothing at all no damages at all happened on that side\nIs just totally centered around the Panama City east the saint Marc to apple logical to been been there\nIt's a it's interesting because of hurt a number of people say who had to hunker down that they didn't really have time to evacuate why was that\nYou know and and I don't quite understand that because of the state of Florida has a great thing and they call it the Seventy chews on you and what me which means uh you've got about a Seventy two hour period really prepare for these things and you know Governor Scott did an amazing job you got to give this guy credit ... boots on the ground he was\nAt the emergency operation centers at all of the communities in ... county and bay county which is Panama City by the way Tallahassee and you know ... of course it's a big political a time of year here in Florida because the germs are coming up and you see some of the politicians that you never saw before\nI get to the spotlight and they want that airtime on television or radio but governor Scott's been there since day one he's been there for all of the storms\nAnd you got to get this guy credit he has been on the ground and he's really directed at great operation a movement for the emergency operations shutters\nSpeaking this morning with Chris Brian he's the director of programming a news at FM talk one oh three point seven double UPENN radio in Pensacola, Florida one of our ability as a so you mentioned you had been through Katrina is it difficult to compare since that hit a major city and there really aren't that that is not that type of thing there in the panhandle of Florida\n... ... you know it it is it's a different animal altogether but most people don't really realize yes New Orleans was the big\nThe big element of that storm but actually Katrina hit Mississippi and a New Orleans just had the flooding aspect the levees broke as if you remember the levees breached a it was the uh water situation water problem is is a pretty much a a wind related storm\nI Know in in the Pensacola desolate area got less at one point five inches of rain um but it was really I write maker but you really can't compare the two in terms of the immediate damage\nKatrina water ah Michael it was when really you\nKnow give me ... let me about thirty seconds ... why just out of curiosity that region there that Mexico beach area has gone on developed or is not overrun with tourists when it's so pretty\nWell because a development in terms of real estate development beaches by the way you know the beaches from Pensacola aged ... to Panama City the most beautiful white because of the world absolutely but once you get a little bit of the Panama City\nBeach tech your change is a different color not same white and it's a it's more of a kind of a wind related coastline ah with with trees and things like that it's just not the same as the beach developed communities the panhandle to the west\nAnd that's probably why it is a a lot more rivers things like that but I gotta tell ya\nGordon if you ever want to see something that is that's version and just as beautiful as can be a big band is gorgeous in the state of the old Florida yeah you want to see how Florida was in an upset in

yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the U.S still tend to either holds or\nOr the week and a little bit as they approach land but Michael is intensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was making landfall so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and they give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened hereby rain\n[laughter] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a year or go to Georgia and it spread it all of its rain into a part of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and ah over the next twenty four hours it'll just moved a pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas in the southeast Virginia and spread some rain\nOr as well

this thing will finally be out to sea will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know or you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a thing of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively lower population swat in the floor ... still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there is a small all sorts of relief and certainly as far as the the the the overall damaged figure from this is that it hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nAh why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that that shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to pack up\n[noise] yeah I mean part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so ah so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but\nCertainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this they usually put a watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance of but\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect the borderline cat five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks [laughter]\nWell you know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems out in the central and eastern Atlantic not worry about it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay buried in Central America and that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats\nOr over the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons don't go into November leaks do could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the the worst of the hurricanes the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still

second most powerful court\nThe DC circuit court of appeals is known not only for the cases that region but also for being a pipeline to the Supreme Court more from Libya wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hill Lydia what's up here\nThe DC circuit court of appeals is this a really in the court on its own not only for the case of that region but also the career short trajectory of to get on a bench and it's known as the second most powerful court in the country and it has had\nA I guess it and let the justice but Justice John Roberts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nOr Justice Clarence Thomas in the late Justice Antonin Scalia all offended by the gate to the Supreme Court\nWell what are some of the names are being floated right now as potential replacements for Kavanaugh\nRight so my thoughts are telling me that this administration is going to look for someone who is barely scraped and administrative law\nOn because this is a court but here's and kind of regulatory challenges choose to regulation that the federal agencies issue as well as separation of powers issues to basically it handled anything and that or any of the uh\nAdministration's actions that are being challenged the cases that here\nAt my church that they're actually saying that\nAt Trump's regulatory thought Neomi Rao could be on the shortlist and she is the administrator at the White House at the information and regulatory affairs and she'd been instrumental in helping Trump and his goal and cutting down regulation\n... speaking with Lydia wheeler legal affairs reporter at the hill she's got a piece called Trump's faces new decision on second most powerful court talking about the DC circuit court of appeals where\nBrett Kavanaugh left when he joined the Supreme Court how eager by the way with the Trump Administration would be to fill this is this something or is it a race against the clock so you head of the November midterms\nHow quickly and they're going to do with that kind of been a little bit slower um I can get them their main focus was on the Supreme Court and now the ... and we haven't heard any room and they have in a back seat to nominate anybody\nAnd they're not sure how quickly will see that and you know they thought that was the question of if they put them in the head of the new term\nAnd whether or not there than it would have time to get them ... gets liquid and likely that they would on because uh out of the senators will be leaving and I took it back to their home takes on to get ready for the near term at though\nYou know and then we have you know what happened in the terms couldn't couldn't really shake up the seat and because that could be that open for a long time especially if Democrats take control the Senate\nAnd the euro too that the the DC circuit court differs from other federal appeals court in the types of cases it here's how come explain that\nWeight that this is a court that explicitly and it has special responsibility every evening rockets challenging federal government action than decision and that means every dollar constitutional question involving separation that power issues and challenges and we're making\nAnd so you know it kind of any time like an agency action challenged go directly to that caller\nAre good and it's the the balance right now at least a politically would be what is it like seven Democrats three appointed by Republican something like that\nThat that is right that that it's a and a court that is most at a stretch it had been appointed by Democrats\nAnd the cat and I was a a a Republican appointee I mean keep moving on to the Supreme Court\nThat his replacement and who would likely be nominated by Trump would be another conservative judge so whoever replaces isn't going to change the ideological balance of the court in any way that one conservative for another day now and just kind of waiting to the uh what who the administration type attack", "show_name": "This Morning With
