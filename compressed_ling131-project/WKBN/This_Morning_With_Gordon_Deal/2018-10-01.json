even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt\nThe two twin girls in the backseat looked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses\nBut I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came

didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped in I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV\nOnto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um you know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange\nStrange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the

of hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for\nHours up there and went down at looking at stars to the ... and I heard that same sound that he's talking about as best as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and it at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kind of like hey what are you doing up here and I've\nGot a second guessing but oil it's really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic impression wasn't all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd now I jumped in my car so that got out of

cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aid security though are really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aids by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered to scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing systems to these where they um the service like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a patch of eligible\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis defeat when the um the customer has at patch that system\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet they think system could not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the Internet that not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also used to calculate the vote so these are actually the most critical ... not the Internet they think that some\nGuy so if you're if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections isn't the act as a part glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is I'm back in\nA state and county need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are not looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter

that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington did she decided that they didn't want\nThat's happened again and they thought they came to the wrong conclusion that it was the\nPaper ballot that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do we count a manual recount and so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those stunts and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all\nAnd that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cyber security journalist Nineteen Minutes

repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nGot to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who thought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price [laughter]\nSo he didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what types of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much wary or of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example like it used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several reasons for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your ... here and you realize there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people one is to not start the next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being forms actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nOr speaking with Greg ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or the ... related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ... and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nIn that similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like you've got to bust into recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but uh about which\nThe risk to start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risk to have a kind of like goes away that sort of changes shape it's sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily indebted companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you some sense still have the risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system would be safer as a result\n... chief

Mrs Clinton I think made it sound like women are weak and powerless at times when it was of this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want and uh to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's protecting against by going to the ballot box\nUm and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too we could stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives are have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but\nIn particular I'm making it\nMore convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote\nAnd they can go and make sure everybody gets their mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many fans you can send out to get people to the voting booth [noise]\nUm but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote a there is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\n... turning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm part this is because a lot of what that would be um democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort [noise]\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient so the more convenient you can make it the more likely you are to get voters to turn out who are otherwise it deterred by inconvenient [noise]\nMm [noise] just uh uh I don't I don't think I've heard pushback on this with regards to these comments from Mrs Clinton is is just like a fairly new excuse or is this one that she's been using\nWell you know to the point was Hillary has been making this excuse for why she lost\nI kind of connected the dots with the vote by mail because she was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible [noise] um but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that\nThere are any women were being pressured to vote one way or another the only way they could possibly be actually pressured is if they don't have the

Strasse leak problem you know lots of lots of issues around they're they're scheduled on worker advocacy groups are definitely pushing for this um but it you know it's unclear if these policies can really solve all of workers scheduling problem\nI was just thinking I Wonder if some of them might complain they could to get robbed of overtime hours for example of something changed\nThat much of a concern but I just think that some of these laws are not really necessarily directed at\nSome of the biggest pinpoint that employees that we come from talking to them in on one thing is that a lot of workers are worried about not getting enough hours on because you're making an hourly wage so if you're not getting enough hours you might not have enough money one week for your rent or your car or food\nAnd ... do try to get workers more our some of them have stipulation that say that employers have to go to current employees and offer them more hours before hiring additional employees um\nIt's unclear if I'm at the laws are really making a big difference in terms of total number of hours for workers\nAre at so who who's doing what I Know you've given McDonald's McDonald's example\nThey talk

do I do I get busy at the end of someone shift I used to just like kind of ...\nThey would say and they would say and I would pay them for that time but now if they stay more than a half hour over that's considered a schedule changed and I have to pay an additional the in addition to just their hourly wage it they would be earning a lot more for managers to think about\nOh we're speaking with Wall Street journal management reporter Rachel finds it just got a piece titled new laws aimed to make work hours more predictable does the uh if some of these laws go into effect it does the size of the business matter the number of employees\nYes on there really aimed at bigger businesses so it depends on the law but a lot of them are like over five hundred employees or you have to have a certain number of locations in the United states so we're not really talking about small businesses here\nStill the status of some of the like you mentioned a New York city though the whole state of Oregon uh does does seem to have bipartisan support or is it not gotten that far yet\n[laughter] I mean we're definitely things crop up in the areas where we tend to see more progressive legislation at your workplace legislation pop up somewhere like Seattle where they've already had a big minimum wage crush on you know area that we're we're seeing kind of knew paid sick leave laws\nOn like at New York Seattle San Francisco Emeryville, California\nUm these are definitely cropping up in and more kind of liberal outpost\nAnd then you you gave an example to of a gap that has gone through with this what I think experience maybe some growing pains but results have been favorable\nTo I mean there are a lot of companies that are just doing this of their own accord whether they see the writing on the wall that this legislation is coming whether they think it's the right thing to do for workers\nUm whether they think they're some on recruitment retention benefit for that and some companies are kind of coming out of this before the law's impact them and to tap\nOn had kind of a big pilot study where they implemented scheduling change it and all their stores and then try to that group that kind of went even further and they they did the positive result they saw an increase in sales and productivity\nOn and so yes like some of the growing pains that we see from the Donald franchisee

journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times and what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aid security though are really not in a much of a different shape than we weren't you have a sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way what's what's what's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the adjusted prior to two dozen fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered this scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system so these were the um the servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and um it will keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has had patched up to them\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the mountain is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system could not getting at the core ... they're supposedly not connected to the in it or not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um what are the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters\nA there used to program the voting machines and they're also used to calculate the votes so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think this them\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence were you saying there are there some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections is needs to be hacked 'cause at Fort Bliss going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want letters to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nUm and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't vote\nYou point out there is a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nUm yes so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots of digital those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other either you need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got to be running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so

that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington did she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all\nAnd that's how we got the more we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity journalist

them into securities to make them seem risk was\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how do you see it\nWe got to Christ basically because who uh everybody became somewhat blind to the presence of risk letter was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline and price\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we're individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether to the regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts in crises [laughter] but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking off from which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much wary or of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example like it used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and it's expensive too\nOr it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand of the crisis and they've kind of learn to sort of like be more cautious they're investing and so we see an investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted\nYou don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know ... it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nWhat people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new businesses being formed does actually historically quite low I I think it's troublesome I mean essentially a people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with Greg ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean\nOnce we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or that aren't related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat as I say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate and fell into that so in some sense pessimism is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that is similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like if he had a bust in a recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but up about which\nIs the risk to start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risque but kinda like goes away can sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encounters a barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now some of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like heavily companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds\nSo you some sense skill at risk out there it's just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief
