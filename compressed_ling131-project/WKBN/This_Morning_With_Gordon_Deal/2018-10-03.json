hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers\nOr either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nContributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nYou know there's a lot of a concern and in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always at ... they've always got a lot of money in Washington\nAnd in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement not election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talked about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support a candidate such AS Party a you know the Democratic Republican governors a tax cut that basically support ah getting\nGovernors one party or the other or are there similar richer attorney general on for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to war ...\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase a backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies\nHave been in the ass ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a how and where and when ... ... and in some cases how much they spent on these different uh election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example that used to publish report on their political activity and now they don't or their reports or watch a informative than they used to be a fewer companies now in part because of a new company is joining the U.S and be five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display the political spending reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies stay a million bucks it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been an index longer tend to do better at disclosing\nOur where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies reference to Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on the political spending in talking to me they said their position hadn't changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like fiber one she fours and twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language to Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they told their trade associations not to use ... for a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Center for political accountability but then also us\nSome show us or shoulder advocates\nHave put pressure on individual companies overtime and may proposals to uh you know as you're older tape much tell the company to produce a political spending

[noise] how about a ebbs and flows as I Do know particular issues come to the forefront in any given week does that does that happening\nNot really I mean it was so we've seen for example recent polling in North Dakota which shows the Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp is in trouble that's not surprising it's North Dakota it's a very red state uh there's been some indication or or or I should say some some\nA return to recall arguing that had high campus suffering from support for Kavanaugh that ... that she wasn't immediately on board with a supporting Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nHas been pointed to as a reason that she's a falling behind there but it is a state that the Democrats have consistently had trouble in any way so I'm not sure that's really the case the main thing that we're seeing is partisanship\nThat in states where there are a where Hillary Clinton won for example Democrats and you will in states that Donald Trump won the new well there are some outliers like West Virginia\nWhere Joe Manchin still maintains a lead a despite the fact that he's a Democrat in a very red state but as a general rule no it doesn't seem to be swayed by ...\n... we're speaking with Philip bump national correspondent at the Washington Post she's written a piece in Delaware the fight for the Senate stands right now um how much could things change over the course of the next month there was starting to get really locked in here\nTo some extent I mean we were starting to see where races are starting to separate to some extent and what that means is that parties will then stop putting money in those races which means that those races will become even more solidly whatever color they were training and the first place I guess we're going to see some of that really this is going to come down to a handful maybe five Senate seats\nOn election night which will determine control the Senate I think the house\nPretty likely to to go to the Democrats at this point in time but the Senate continues to be a big question mark\n... what were those that did you ... ... five thirty eight crunching numbers than they about are the odds of one party claiming the house and the Senate\nThey did yeah and so those numbers change a lot depending on what polls they get in but essentially it is the Republicans have about a one in ... chance of holding the house the Democrats have about a one in five chance of taking center\nOkay so you were to it like this some of the gubernatorial races correct any any notable similarities\nRemarkable about the governor's races is that if you look for example the Senate map and look at the state of pulling there there's a lot of sort of ... areas where the Democrat and Republican or wanting sort of even\nIf you look at the gubernatorial map though there are a lot of states where there is an incumbent Republican governor who is usually going to win reelection right so you look at a state like a Maryland or Larry Hogan is very popular looks like he's not going to have too much trouble running for re election even though it's a blue state\nAnd there are a lot of reasons for this one of course is the fact that the Democrats have a map on the Senate side so you're going to see 'em a few ... great voices they're simply because there aren't a lot of\nYou know strong popular Republicans are up for re election but another too is that there's obviously a big difference between state and federal and so people in Maryland is like Donald Trump but like the job Larry Hogan is doing an organ and other Republican governors that represent blue states\nActually came out and said hey let's let's put the brakes on this Kavanaugh nomination which is a sort of thing that you can do as\nWhat are you can't do the Republican Senate\nLike Philip Philip bump at the Washington Post\nForce of the program is ... by our friends at Harry's up in a Harry's\nUser for years now my favorite part is this leak candle in the ... comfortable shave you get each time my son was a teenager now uses Harry's my father's a user let's three generations and my family\nFor a limited time only new customers can save big on a Harry's shapes that with the code deal at Harry's dot com get a five bleed razor waited handle shaved Jill and trouble cover for just three bucks and free shipping\nHarry's bought a world class blade factory in Germany where they grind steel into sharp durable blades and they stand behind the quality of their products do if you don't love your shave let them know they'll give you a full refund\nFor a limited time only Harry such a special offer for listeners of our program new customers get five dollars off of ... from Harry's\nWith the code deal at ... dot com that's H.

flu season was notable for the record breaking levels of flu illness and hospitalization rates throughout the country tragically there were also one hundred eighty flu related pediatric debts\nReminder of just how serious blue can be as the new flu season approaches time for a review on how best to protect ourselves we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville\nWorking with the CDC doctor what should we know\n... there's going to be a flu season that's the thing we should all know\nMore severe let severe but it will be here who is nasty which means that now it's time to get vaccinated let's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about if you're older than six months of age\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't want\nBritain virus this nasty virus anybody at work in in your family at home and your house of worship don't be graded spread her\nGet vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is it to create the corrective vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get the more serious complications there are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them\nOne is called simply high dose and the other has a fancy name called the ... vaccine that just means there's an immune stimulant in it\nThe pharmacies and doctors' offices almost all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five and older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\nI'm do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\nVaccines don't make it more difficult in fact they aren't the single best thing we have available to combat the flu and we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older\nThose younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illness such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nTo women who are pregnant and back flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen were pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications have we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus the protection they make actually passes a cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby and provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC as we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these the season is going to be like who is worse than last year or not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season the odds that or crystal ball it's cloudy and that's why we just say well let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I don't try to anticipate there's this guy that was a good one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains within three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that the pharmacist for about ...\nWhat about uh what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's a you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple\nThe CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing and if he should get sick don't wait\nCall your health care provider because they may prescribe and anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the much less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a comprehensive approach\nDoctor bill Schaffner

on the elections and other political activity\nA new report by the center for political accountability studies annual political spending policies as it would be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred and twenty Fifteen increasing numbers\nOr either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofit more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and then some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling out a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral\nPolitics I've always paid lobby they've always got a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate law but none election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what\nThis shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates in other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political party they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party\nOr you know the Democratic Republican uh governor's a tax cut that basically support or the right getting governors one party or the other\nOr a similar groups for attorney general and state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we\nDon't want to use money I'm going to Orange Beach area\nWhile we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase up backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produces report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at that but you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen companies have been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a\nHow and where and when they spend ... and in some cases how much they spend on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example that used to publish a report on the political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than it used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies ... hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah to display their political standing reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay a million bucks it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been in the index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was a mayor do they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability XYZ in how they disclose what the restrictions are on a on the political spending in talking to me they said their position hadn't changed they still\nAre don't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like fiber one she fours or twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of this they don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they tell their trade associations not to use ... for a lecture activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization the center for political accountability\nBut then also uh some\nShareholder activists or shoulder advocates\nHave put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to ah you know I asked her older tape much tell the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either she and how those votes go over time or just on their own initiative\nGoaded the investor and said look what's hash out at the southern you remove this project proposal
