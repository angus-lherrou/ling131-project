Pelosi meanwhile are featured in tens of thousands of ads Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up and quite a bit of mid term advertising um specific to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in midterms advertising and that's health care\nAnd taxes [laughter] um so he ranks AS number three in most common themes in mid term to advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes she is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount of positive Trump ads out there when we found that even I'm\nIn a Democratic Senate at he's turning\nUp any positive supportive way that set the scene and places like Indiana West Virginia where the Democratic senator it's trying to hold onto his seat and said that Trump won quite a bit and twenty sixteen\nTypes of advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when he for Hoosier time with him and another ad in\nWest Virginia has a candidate you know kind of say I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia so there's been supportive tone that type of advertising one thing that really interested me about the state of what we found that although you think that President Trump with is\nLower than typical favorability ratings and how much he dominates the news would be just blowing things out of the water in terms of negative advertising President Obama actually far and away surpass him as a sort of milling in advertising back in twenty fourteen times during his\nPresidency and that you're fifty percent of all Republican

advertising you saw that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races\nAnd we found that you know about nine percent eight nine percent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti
