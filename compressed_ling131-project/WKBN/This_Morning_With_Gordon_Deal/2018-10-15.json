lost civilizations starting something in ... uh and\nAnd the old kingdom are Egyptians or a you know building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right\nYes so um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on\nOn the pyramid itself on the on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is that walk that's not humor in stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of\nYou know allow for stone to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has seen you ate it is that things that maybe there were shrines on in the three locations and there were a line to you know the belt stars of uh Ryan a dating to the happy\nAnd then you know the old kingdom Egyptians came they basically built up your image on top of the shrines\nAnd so a softer so what's under the pyramid\nAlso you know the subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kings chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a new phase monument like there was something there before and then the pyramid was built on top so it's an excellent question um proving it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely something that's possible\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating

time when people coming out of high school so they they pretty much had guaranteed jobs there yeah that was a way of life and it was really the heartbeat of town for for generations\nAnd it was also really the only game and tell them they get paid most towns taxes provided also the jobs and that meant shutdown a decade ago and that's the town that was very badly by that population shrank\nAnd
