even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this was\nThe most closely guarded secret and the entire war in the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and knew what it was and his uh his companion ... no one who was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and I don't know that extra precaution with taken\nBecause this ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to

the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah the element of was carried on to the ship and a brief case but there was a lot of these stories that we are told about what might be in their right

blamed which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect\nBlaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening and they thought that was the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a

the water the was just flowing in three that that a long three a deck and so um\nThere were a lot of questions and the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she was open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions\nSome of the families who had last man on the shit I blamed captain they even know keeping that three deck open

considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here have become closer than people expect that they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter]\nSo maybe a forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president\nStarts a one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as the the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual race there in that um that hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um [noise] so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race\nWell All right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet so probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger and democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our pool and other polls have shown a gender gap\nAnd and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for\nA democratic controlled house and are often more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but\nIf that is indeed the case it looks like women are more place to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there got it\nWe're speaking with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tightened as mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outraged by Carole and a boy do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while\nOne of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that um are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so do you know they can see it Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hearty\nUh and then the second ... Republicans are optimistic about it's currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and has a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter] um this is a little bit [laughter]\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nWings Christina it's Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson\nThe program is walking by different you know was not making the lottery\nThe centerpiece of your retirement plan despite to lotteries current size right but you know what is more\nGoing to zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon do hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you\nZip recruiter finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies skins thousands of resumes then identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast that's wise dip recruiter\nIs rated number one by employers in the U.S in just reading comes from hiring sites on trust pilot\nWith over one thousand reviews\nAnd right now our listeners tries to recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter\nDot com slash Gordon that zip recruiter dot com slash Gordon zip recruiter the smartest way to hire you want to ... for out of five companies say they find a qualified candidate on the job recruiters site within just a single day\nThirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news\n\n\n\nThey'll fight from their\nBalance of\nSelection updates on the germ we've already control\nWhich party controls is a really exciting going on right now we live Seventy\nKatie and bring them to the U.S are pushing\nThrough southern Mexico President Trump's however promising to use the military to stop them if they reach the U.S border ABC cast mountain president blaming Democrats for the caravan\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder who started that caravan the president\nAlso threatened to cut off aid to several Central American countries if the caravan continues\nSaudi officials now say reporters democracy hoagie died when he was put in a chokehold well inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey and he sees Molly hunter isn't assembled\nNow Eighteen fatty are in custody and five top intelligence officials have been fired including I meant bending signed as scary and very close advisor to the crown prince ... foreign minister is standing by the claim they can come on and the crown prince means nothing\nNational security adviser John Bolton starts to days of talks with Russia Today after President Trump announced he wants to pull out of a key nuclear weapons treaty Sherry pressed an ABC News\nWas founded in England\nThis weekend Nineteen Twenty one the Green Bay Packers play their first NFL game seven six wind over the Minneapolis Marines this week in Nineteen thirty nine NBC become the first network to televise a pro football game the Brooklyn Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Eagles twenty three to fourteen at Brooklyn Ebbets Field\nThis week in Nineteen sixty six ice hockey legend body or scores his first career goal against the Montreal Canadians at the time of the\nSeventy W.

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened since Nineteen Ninety two [noise]\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite the manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been a kind of a difference in many respects the president enough of another example he's saying things about the fact that he's blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy [noise]\nUm he said that they were his biggest threat to them and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said I'm a ... part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fed a if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets and you know even though there was some speculation there about why he's doing this\nIf you look at the ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people [noise] uh sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of dead presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA boat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's into doing this just to kind of a running public criticism of the central bank\nAnd you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents or criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else a as per usual when the president does something like this he started the discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent [noise]\n... exactly right um people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is doing but rather than Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates are ... you know as as a slack disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but what ... what President Trump is saying here as well world the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates\nThat we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with new gym arose Wall Street journal economics reporter who's ... presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be catering to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what you want\nThat's right the question isn't very ah difficult right now the you know most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decision to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case for a year from now what city you're from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation is maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tell you you should do and so the question is on a close call where you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy path to the president's criticisms get in your head at all and there are some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the credibility\nThan that's even worse and so it might actually stiffen their backs a little bit [noise]\nUm but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore this\nOr we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy\nAnd if people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that\nMix Wall Street journal economics reporter Nick to morose is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.

legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition who tend to to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nWell you know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall that are running for office but within that\nUm there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women and politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern in in in other line of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi had five kids didn't run for office until the\nI'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by then by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen wave of women running scientists that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency specifically among democratic women who are running there's a sense of urgency\nAbout running it you know we need to be part of the movement also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a um I don't know what ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess get sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for kind of generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints about the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older\nUh so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of\nOf a movement forward um they also I think women in general and young women in particular bring\nMore focus and attention to a women's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um\nAnd you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of study the style of leadership that women have brought to Congress and they she concluded that with more women in Congress and more with younger women\nThat there might actually be a more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought was interesting to the the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled the campaign funds can be used by childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for the house in New York on Long Island her name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of a reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old\nShe went ahead and um started running and was kind of relying on her mom for for Kyle care help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lotta money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to pay for childcare\nAnd lo and behold they should this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark\nThat says I'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for\nOffice that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nWith Janet Hook national political reporter at the wall Street Journal she's got to be entitled young women aren't waiting to seek political power I use it to their mobilizing not just as

unsuspecting online customers law enforcement authorities in several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of recent steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan ... who's been researching this make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible\nAirbag that this is a a climate is existed for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of their hand as as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that these airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle they they basically ... out of the steering wheel and then they sell it on the black market\nAnd it's in connection with watches anybody who happens to be in an accident and blows the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens is that when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these types airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example in the search for this even with the their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealer she suddenly you're not going to end up accidently buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's ... it's because they're popular vehicles and just happened to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's for a long way targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact that they're popular\nBut we don't make much sense to me is why only because in talking to the police and various markets um you know almost every incentive looked at it was exclusively on this so you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific\n... or something and exactly what it is I'm\nProbably the the themselves only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nYeah so at the the ... ah what uses a knife and kinda strips away the covering the Centre part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nExactly they they somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically a use a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes [laughter] um I I did some incidents where\nYou know they hit a dozen vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night [laughter] so you know it's it's definitely I'm not a difficult thing to think about this is like you know\nAs a laptop off the seat in the car I mean if the left towards thousand dollars [laughter] that's about how much this is worth so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so the incentive is also gotten up\nWell we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece of metal police the flurry of Honda airbags deaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself a is there is there a best

districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot at a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races fat we're kind of at no word at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here has become closer than people expect that they would\nAnd over the net in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter]\nSo maybe at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent the districts you know that he comfortably carried by where there's more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfy but the president and\nSo one of them was like in ah in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two wasted in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that it's sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie How Arab butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years has a significant challenger has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered\nOr votes then congressman butler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as did the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual waste there in that\nUm that hasn't been considered you know one of the swing districts but Carolyn longest campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race\nWell All right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of\nEnergy and enthusiasm from voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women are\nShowing more of a preference for a democratic controlled house and are often more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of\nMid term that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there\nDraw to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near or to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman Rob a little\n[noise] yes this is an interesting race um would all is definitely being outraged by Carolyn a boy do who was also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta this current events and one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so do you know they can see it Republicans feel they have a better shot rather than an seat in democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican cresent hardy [noise] uh and then the second ... the the Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada [laughter]\nFor speaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill ammonia she's written a beat in Jeddah more American women are

having babies earlier or later\nRight exactly and um there's you know obviously it's a very controversial topic and um you know you can't always control death and you know every woman's experience is very different but um yeah there have been sort of mixture thoughts on\nOn you know if people should you know quote unquote should have children earlier or later in their career you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women and said a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier um and about the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought on that either had her children earlier when you yourself earlier in your career and then um you know when there are a little bit older you can really you know leaning speak and and really extend your career on or you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having your baby when\nYou're a little more established it's better um but it also so much depends on you know what you're competing maternity policy youth and all those kinds of things so um you know obviously it every individual

doesn't have a reason for them [noise] us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W. Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president [noise] um you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened [laughter] trying to Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been [noise] I'm kind of a different in many respects to the president enough of another example he's saying things about about a blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gone crazy\nTo me that they were his biggest threat to [noise] um and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\nThat's what he said I'm a part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fed a if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets and you know even though there's some fluctuation there [noise] about why he's doing this [laughter] if you look at it\nThe lovers the president has influenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people [noise] uh sit on the board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA vote every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's doing this just to kind of a\nRunning public criticism of the central bank\nAnd the you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents for criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president does something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] for exactly right [laughter] people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is too and but rather them Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as as a black disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but what ... what President Trump is saying here as well worth the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates that we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nSpeaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter who's pieces called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be caving to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very um difficult right now the head [noise] you know most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates so the decisions they have to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case for a year from now let's say you're from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tells you you should do\nAnd so the question is on a close call where you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the feds credibility", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "22"}
