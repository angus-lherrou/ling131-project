days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to an al hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we have actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant role districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decide to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district ... or early spring ... you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they start at notice and other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or say wow you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing what teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from\nFifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started out when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow that each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\nYes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care you\nKnow how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states

pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handled accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that's what it would do it we go again and it certainly would take the evidence that was presented and what determines whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this
