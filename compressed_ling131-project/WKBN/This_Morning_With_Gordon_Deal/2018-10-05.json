it's not true ah I run something called the Trump Amish report card you're at a finance a we're give Trump were accepting that Trump's performance on the economy on a monthly basis we currently give

does its own thing\nOf a truck but presidents either get credit or blame for it so\nYou know Trump is doing okay on the economy um but some of the things she hearing you have to say what is it really

toward China and getting them to do something different\n[laughter] well I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he picked by to Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum in the United states that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through these developments it does seem that ... that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts who say look we really don't have as much a trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else these are basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies\nUm when you need their help\nTo put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement on a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nYears uh I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries and that is not a given um if it turns out that Democrats take back control of the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be a very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible we

Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base the head of the mid term elections or attack Dr forward and reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nWell even though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors so Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads in races that were pretty close and Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee has been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so\nThat has at least for the time being been a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which had been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republicans in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on Tuesday as them\nOr a big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh ah her Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA who are now in the upper single digits or in terms of his lead and the polling average is a you know that was a race it's been close it's been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen a I think we've seen also ah the school has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill a declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch\nHuh Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general the state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that did have her up three\nBut in the point averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead and this could be a a race let's influenced by by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mental politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections were Democrats are already pretty energized because they dislike President Trump\nThey dislike Republicans are doing a Washington seems to them uh like another power grab a bite narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump and the first place was we wanted conservative judges cared about who is controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal to have Anthony Kennedy seat go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term elections so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\n... mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner\nForce of the program is Rossi my recruiter not smart
