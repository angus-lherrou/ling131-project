{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Oh Joe is coming out with a book if we could get some information on that\nLet's do it right now Joe uh yes I Know you you ... you've already written one book right\nI I wrote a book called mind trick Hampton Roads a publishing company Nineteen Ninety three it's recently been revised and it's it's a will probably hit the stands and\nA ten ten days two weeks and uh I've added chapters on Stargate and some of the myths surrounding remote joined\n... and it's a pretty good and send them a compendium of information a remote doing uh I've also recently forwarded a the following looked in my truck to my agent or as of today or yesterday I Can't remember and\nHopefully that will be seen on the shelves at some future date\nHow people get your books\nA there's a real easy way uh they can call the one eight hundred number okay ah it's\nOne eight hundred seven six six eight zero zero nine and a that's Hampton Roads publishing and and they will be glad to service the requests for the walk or they can go to any Barnes and noble or any other a major supplier of books\nNot only does one eight hundred seven six six eight zero zero nine that's correct anybody else write a book\nThat was not yet although I Do plan to have a website up fairly soon [laughter] so I don't know there there is an information on lens website about my my company but uh that's about the extent of it right now\nAnd Paul is beginning to teach to so he may want to give people is his number where he can be contacted her All right\nI'll give you my email um it's uh the company I've incorporated is remote viewing instructional services right so ... ... email is are the high ass right at\nTidal wave T. I. D. A. L.\nYou a V. E. dot net\nOkay that's a R. V. I. S. at tidal wave one word dot net right All right and uh you answer your email I take it\nYes you know it I can guarantee I keep up or if I have if I get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe as you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original ... and then later at us I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nUh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or up here and we hope to continue pursuing the mechanisms behind doing\nJohn you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress an oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nOr we we of course it see so are are they going into science as well has never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function\nWe've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will ah there'll be some very astounding a findings that will open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier cells\n[laughter] every time I chose scares me enough uh\nI I Am [noise] uh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it I Would agree with that or\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said\nThis is lousy I'm I'm I'm bored or I'm On the interested and I'm not doing it anymore is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't do it however if you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it then I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n[noise]\nUm I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nMost I call 'em\nSound like somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this one and I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and to explore it and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's it that's right Joes this joke and I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain their skepticism and to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain or open\nA to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge is developed and it's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions\nWell you know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want to Institute a demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national ah a national television and anyone\nIn America and uh one of the requirements has been that they just abolition follow very closely the protocols in in those performances have have an open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe we're out of time Joe a and Paul thank you both will continue with a ... good night gentleman tonight actually his talk right stay right there in\nThe trip back in time

be done\nOr the answer is yes however let me ah [noise] ah say that [noise] that type of uh work or is sometimes achieved much more easily uh\nBy some other disciplines oh\nI've I've heard it said that a remote viewing\nYou're you're not talking about bar hopping right\nOh no [laughter] ah oh as far as you know the the disciplines prepare psychology or if you if you're trying\nTo learn remote viewing in order to get in touch with the universe or your higher self uh it's sort of like joined in the Marines to learn how to fold your clothes\nOr it's a it's extremely disciplined\nAnd uh

uh-huh um what are your thoughts on his conclusion [laughter]\n... inclusion or the end conclusion was that a yes this shows that are there is something to remote viewing a seemingly however oh\nWe don't have all of the potential is for a for shooting it down and so or even though we can't shoot it down right now we're just going to wait until the time comes when we can shoot it down before we make a decision\nAnd uh this to me is not a a [laughter] there's not a valid a\nConclusion the ah the conclusion he came to is basically the [noise] excuse me\nThat he admitted that the statistics show that there is value to the remote viewing that there is an actual phenomenon going on\nBut uh interesting reaction\nYeah but let's not decide right now until we can find a way to shoot it down\n[laughter] [laughter] from the James Randi school right now All right I'm here's another facts aren't I've heard cases where remote viewers located military targets during the Gulf War Ken Olin
