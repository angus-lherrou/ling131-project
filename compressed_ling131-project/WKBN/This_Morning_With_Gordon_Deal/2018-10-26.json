may be\nBetter in Tucson for example there are actually number three they have over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with political messaging\nBoy and the majority of the ads feature what races you\nKnow the Senate racing or is he is really the big one a this is the race between Democrat curiously cinema and Republican Mark and mix Sally which one of the last competitive wages on the map it looks like right now so\nThis is a universally fought well financed and uh had its share of sort of ugly messages from both sides but especially each alarmist messages from the mix Sally allied caps\nAre those are my layman's observation near the nasty\nOnes tend to get exhausting after a while our our focus saying to you that I'm okay enough already can we fast

we're just like we're we're tired of this people are like skipping TV they're just sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start\nAnd uh you know people here have seen that across the board for us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we are increasingly politically competitive states so\nThis is something that yeah we've seen politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know\nCar carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nYou know speaking Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic cat ... central dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nHe's got a piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increased over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it's a compared to the terms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what\nWe're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of the stage growing political value or on the board or Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's so far lighter Hugh these days\nDemocrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters in a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call and so we are just a you know inundated with these ads are overwhelmingly negative in a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial power to do it so at any price they would have\nBeen relatively low octane a campaign you know we have a Democrat running for example in in each House Ways ah they are challenging guts move for us and ah these are some times low budget affairs\nAre we even had some Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod ... so you know they are at least a contestant leans races\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from having PG money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against the candidate or is it a TV is king and candidates are going with it\nYou know look at people who actually hate negative advertising but the fact is it does sort of help define your opponent and so people still do it it's still leads an impression with voters and the question is\nWhether there's enough there to put someone down close enough that whatever you might be offering looks more attractive and and that's just kind of the tunnel model in politics", "year": "2018", "show_name":
