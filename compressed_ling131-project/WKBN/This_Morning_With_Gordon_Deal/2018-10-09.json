right you know when you're in a body like us\nI'm a big dumb body you know we don't have that capability and I I I think what happened is\nThe situation started becoming that which an accident was ready to happen right like he didn't tell me this news an hour before he told me sixty seconds before\nSo I don't think that everything is written you know 'cause there's free will there's all those

and I did have a lot in my book because I get into the city for for people that are interested in it um for one of ... for colors look for a purple and greens because you'll see some entities that are like the F purple and green\nI'm looking I look and glass\nAnd that if you take a picture and and like if you're in your truck you know if you're ever going to take a look at that specifically\nUm

that anybody take and I'm really dying for people\nUm that that was upon for people to send me their photograph because I flip them into negative\nAnd when you flip the picture and negative you can see things that you don't see when you first take the picture so there's like little apps called shop is the one I use and I'll put a photo when they're in a negative and it just what's that\nTo the

Michael is a monster storm and the forecast gets skinny more dangerous\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's\nMore conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law but as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him is Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and\nThe whole process just is not to sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief will be to to try to steer the court through the ... meeting are pretty rough partisan times without also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't it's not so sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times you know an an issue that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that to\nYou know that the calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal last year the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary ... meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nThe you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example meat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle test Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice\nIt's ... most people in America could even name and now all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have something to do this for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat\nJustice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh\nTakes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and end up for common ground with [laughter] you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't then

maybe even helpless why does this happen and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly ... tactic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat the cat into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAn accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and center yourself and realize\nThat you're not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons and the brain for I'm I'm past that fry at such a an interest in the ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons to compassion neurons go on overdrive and when\nYou know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle here on mirror neurons\nGet activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all light impact patients has to take news fast you know and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on for a lot of\nStress and negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature meditate exercise ... a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice it past traumas um triggered for instance you know if you lost your father and\nYou know I'm a man was lost in this current accident no your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that different though 'cause they could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation [noise] um and also\nDoing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside\nUm learned you know is a complete sentence with paper because then passed don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no\nNo it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make all this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in the news you don't want to be around\nEnergy vampires will I write about who just drain your energy\nFor re speak with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all the stress from other people's tragedy calls\nHimself a long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely an empty house who don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book had become a goal they never want to go outside they had panic disorders they can have physical diseases a lot of the decisions that the owners because there aren't sensory overload all the time off\nOr they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it and so now I Believe the empathy is a trait that it's going to save the world I really do I feel so strongly about it it's something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and you know to be living to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing his he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the world\nFor decorating the house or just setting the game of our ... my

sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment section too is you know prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies will be getting credit from contributed but that's not necessarily happening at this time\nWhen I say we're speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein you said that ah there's gonna be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the field after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think\nRight now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now it's about you know whether Trump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to resign on their own accord so it's just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has done\nA pretty good job of keeping up eating the president and such a way that he's been able to keep her job and continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally deteriorated for that little bit different\nWhen you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean catching is recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this

has been sampling workplaces ... says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice\nHave made this moment notably personal chip what have you found\nPolitics have really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example\nAh that that they weren't having really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about really personal experiences of sexual assault um once CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates we're getting too heated of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it caused enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[noise] well we heard I talked to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front of her we're talking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to were suddenly redirect conversations their tongue not engage\nBecause they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work that\nThat that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right ... at at work avoid religion politics things like that\nI think for a long time this is politics have stayed out of work for a number of people are told us that they don't

conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of pre counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is just the company is called the Bateman group and offices in New York and San Francisco and a partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefit to the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I found interesting in that particular company that they set up a slack room that had had to set up for the past year\nThe flack room was called ... resistance and it was a police for workers there to really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack

found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to

justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say and the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh comes to this court after this\nBrutal political fight or you know in some\nInflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and\nYou know the whole process just isn't that sort of process it reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court through these ... mean are pretty rough partisan times without also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow do you steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice was like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type ruling so instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not so sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times it on\nAn issue that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that to you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some big legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nThe you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example meat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett

a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for

helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr juice or law\nPsychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat that ... into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAn accident and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and senator your south and realize\nThat you're not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nWell it's interesting it's and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such an interesting ... standing impact and thought that the mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive and when\nYou know for instance if someone is on a T scan and in that you love and they're getting pregnant with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n[noise] so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pat patients has to take this fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on friday a\nStress negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature meditate exercise for an didn't laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas um triggered for instance\nYou know if you lost your father and\nYou know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different don't get that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind to yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside\nUm learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then I don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining and so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're\nCriticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things in a news [laughter] you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about destroying your energy\nOr speak with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York in which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all
