the question was when you start checking or in the ... which I Would be doing next year\nOr I Know you have to total up the balance of the IRA but is the raw I included in that balance\nThat you say I'm you're on the um\nYeah great question Russian great question so when you calculate the R. M. D. amount what you're going to do is that you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four one K. if you're not working are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nOr I Am not working part time only but I'm not contributing to unfold on\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Roth IRA a value in your calculation\nUm so what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross ah and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct uh categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings\nAnd so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a considered it I'm not on okay about four years ago and I'm I'm going to be doing another one\nBecause this is my last year that solve the seven and a half next year I'm going to a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThe the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax amounts you effect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "20"}
