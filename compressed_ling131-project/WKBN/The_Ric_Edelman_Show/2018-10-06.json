R. T. S. X. is the ticker\nI'm the only one thing that I'd want you to watch here is make sure that you would use it inside of a qualified tax qualified accounts like an IRA for on case something like that um because it's it's not the most tax efficient\nA vehicle for taxable accounts were using something different but maybe think about that artist and high income here at the beginning\nNo more than about three four or five percent total of your overall portfolio on the international side uh I'll actually give you a split between two one is an active fun Hartford international value H. I. L. A. X. is the ticker\nI Would combine that with an ATF uh we're doing that right now in a lot of clients accounts\nUm the the ATF that we use a that we're able to use for clients Schwab international equity S. C. H. F. uh but wherever you are a you know if there's any number of each you asked that are available but split between the two H. I. L. A. X. and then that a passive\nA fund on that side and then you should be good for the international position depends on how conservative moderate aggressive that you are\nOr maybe start somewhere around

complicated\nInsurance contracts now Jason has set of questions who are asking Andy investing cents dot com and box and he writes Andy I'm new to investing and I don't have much to invest and I was wondering if a robo adviser account was worthwhile it looks good on paper what your advice\nA great question Jason and you know look if you've got five thousand dollars or less than yes a robo adviser could be a good jumping off point that you said that you're a ... that you're new to investing if you're young\nYou have a long time horizon I'd go one step further and make this even easier for you just open an IRA or a brokerage account by an index fund that tracks the U.S and the five hundred regularly and fast\nAnd then once you get to maybe ten ten thousand dollars or so diversify a bit more by some small cap some international stock but don't make this more complicated than what it needs to be\nSo you know think about your personal situation you've got those IRAs got the brokerage accounts your situation is getting more complex you're looking at a hundred thousand or more saved her invested it's probably going to make some sense for you to get a second pair of eyes on your plan

certified financial planner professional Andy Smith\nA few moments Sandy will get deep into this week's portfolio review first Scott's calling from\nHe is eight eight eight eight three three have six three seven and here's a question about a large stock position in his four one K. Scott thanks for calling fire away with your question\nSo I worked at a company for Twenty years of uh for one still was a it it's through fidelity and it's about four hundred thousand dollars\nAnd a lot of drivers tied up in that your your comedy stock I Would like to bring that for him to do on my current\nUh but somebody mentioned something about the idea of comedy because it's the stock and movie that I don't quite understand that\nScott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off okay pretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump sum up\nBut I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to with four hundred thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock take that four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash\nWithin the roll over IRA you open this on an open platform Schwab and you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds ... all at your disposal but if you move the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see a much more limited selection of funds or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much man have a good weekend you're too\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for one k.'s and I'm guessing that there is a pretty good number of Americans that have for one case that are not being attended\nOh absolutely it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying consolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team\nSo let's go back to Scott's situation and talk about holding a large position in the stock of the company that you worked for within a four one Kay says status through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock\nIt's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but I see this attachment to the stock like they do not see with any of their holding\nThese emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyzed the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and ... and really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement success on the performance an outcome the success or failure of one lone investment there's a just a huge risk here in these situations well and I can\nHear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return but it just like you mentioned there's also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a ... out in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk\nBut now considered to former American blue chip stocks got General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most iconic retail brands in this country if you worked at either of these companies and all you own was concentrated position in that company stock\nThe risk is that you would not have been able to retire because of all you own was G. E. or S H O D you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one\nK. and by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better for you know kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like leeman ah WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen it didn't yeah it just went down to zero\nZero okay and the only defense against this company specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plans if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team\nWell that brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to investing sense dot com now in future shows if he would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsk Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask any at investing sense dot com\nSo Jackie set us her portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the stated interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay this stated rate it held the maturity and or FDIC insured\nSo this is where the conversation started with Jackie but I wanted to dig a little bit deeper so I ask more about the overall situation\nBecause look planning an income stream in retirement is difficult enough to begin with but now you got rates where they are where they could be later on the market in the environment or going to get even more difficult and Bob you have you ever Jackie's reply", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "06"}
