{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "Around here we don't run into that that problem too much with the pollution from would burners but you know you hit Denver\nUm when we go out there and there are certain days when there's a ban on using wood burning a you know furnaces and wood burning fire places no kidding oh yeah adult posted that they blasted on the radio today is not a day it's a a you know as some might be an overcast or whatever day\nAnd they say there's no what burning you can be fined up to five hundred dollars if they see smoke coming out of your chimney and that type of thing so it it gets pretty a pretty touchy out yeah high\nHumidity and ah a warmer temperatures will keep the smoke a down low to the earth but uh the colder you know\nI I started my woodstove yet because of this weather I I it's it's a waste of time for me yeah use of the oil but when it when it gets colder I ... it ... it burns much better you gotta have dry would you know\nAnd then also if he's got two large of a chimney flu I got an eight by twelve and they recommend I put a insert pipe inside it didn't\nHelp to turn down the pipe joke it down\nSo it create more draft but I never did that but I I just I I Know when the burn and when not to burn and uh but uh the APA really put a ...\nOn this [laughter] so I had to get that point\nThat's great I appreciate the call Benny okay very good yeah and\nThey messed up our toilets systems too is not the uh the government is then he said they they had no idea what they were doing when they were making these laws for certain\nYou know what burning you know and furnaces and all this stuff and then they start a mess and then they but they tweak the toilets first and the one and a half gallons or one point one gallon of water and it causes a lot of grief it really does\nBut um yeah it's just it's a sign of the times and get up there in the Denver area they're very particular about how much particularly it\nGoes into the atmosphere because of the thin air in the ... mile high city out there so you got to be really careful you can give us call three three o seven to nine nine nine seven seven and we'll get you on the line got a few minutes left here but I'm just you know just speaking you know if you're looking for people out there and do things around the house\nA lot of them are busy I had a lady called me she had a a week on the roof and um\nShe talked to her this goes back a few years ago she had a a what I Would consider a reputable contractor\nWho happened to ... I think subs out the roof job to somebody to have the you know the legend\nHail damage you know ... she had a roof on there they did not re flash it around the dorm or around the chimney properly and she's been getting leaks and that's why I tell people be careful what you wish for you think you're getting a free roof somebody's taking apart a roof that didn't leak for years\nAnd if a few grand you'll fall off the roof or you've got a couple of ... and the shingles or a couple of this and that and the roof is not the teary rated you don't need a new roof\nOr you're going to cause yourself some grief especially because a lot of the storm chasers to come through your\nUm you know in the main part of the roof when they start to lay the shingles down that's a no brainer that's a quick fast job\nAround the stacks around the chimneys around the door MERS around the bally's that's where it takes the expertise you can't have one of these fly by night groups come through your roof your house and then end up with leaks in the future\nDown the road All right uh Rick who's going to talk about what burner after these messages on five Seventy debate can be an American concrete home care show\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nMost of the plane on corporate money far from over on the phone from one of my family farm phones on\nFrom his use radio five Seventy doubled you Katie in Youngstown\nOhio and find somebody that we keep in biking Jim is out there way out there\nI'm always way out there but this time I'm way out there for a reason I'm going to tell you can't brother twenty rabbis for thirty\nBucks that's a block and a half each I've seen them they're gorgeous steaks also\nWe've got full aged we've got New York strip\nWe got vacuum sealed marinated chicken breasts all great prices if you want to get it on this deal right in the mall or in front of them may see we're kinda next to this years auto center and you can measures we got a big dent in a big truck\nSo if you want to get some good make everybody loves me her come on out there and she is I Can't say to get twenty revised or thirty blocks and they will accept credit and debit card as well you know you got to come get in on this deal brother because once they're gone they're gone\nProtein every body made some protein [laughter]\nI stop out there and see Viking shake his hand shake 'em up and they bought you out there and and maybe you can make some ... ... and yeah then\nIt gets bigger bodies or am I forgot to mention it we can sign you up while when a grill from our friends at Youngstown broke my\nGreat great All right we'll see out there that is All right we're going back to ... morning Rick and you would burn or\nA high I allowed to a U.S brand names on the air yep\nOkay uh I started ... years ago with a Vermont castings wood stove and it had a catalytic converter while in the instructions that says you cannot even use news print or\nYou can withdraw about two million dollars a month yeah that's five hundred grand a week that you could generate an income that's a hundred thousand dollars a day five days a week I don't know how you\nSpend a hundred thousand dollars a day every single day we're not gonna know probably who won the lottery because in South Carolina they let the winters remain anonymous so what could you do with the money well you could probably by the Tampa Bay rays baseball team that's worth about\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees are worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because the total GDP of the British Virgin islands has about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you want not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery ... you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike a bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret police my house no\nAntibiotics positive box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should\nSign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability\nCompany you want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy we're not going to lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million ... taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can put the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live easily do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich people were me and have a security detail around you your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just netted after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give them a million bucks you ... come on you're going to give her\nTen million you just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars\nYou know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety to ... you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you've got\nTo recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have won the lottery of course past performance was known kitchen future results and these are some of the countries of federal fats portions and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one so\nSee aren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on\nTuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only did you get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock market's performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments and what you should do about your investment strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the\nBond market and the real estate market in the market [noise]\nOn the show\nOn line at rice dome and dot\nHost of

director who is actually on his way and he's uh twenty eight year veteran with the FBI so we look at the issue of security throughout the Jewish community where every this morning when I heard the news I I was in my house here in ...\nDid you pay the picture how when you heard that what was going through your head at that moment\nUm you know I I I'm I was in Israel to yesterday and um and and landed back in Pittsburgh late yesterday afternoon\nAnd a and a little jet lagged and and uh when I heard that my my I I just everything just just total or sadness emotion worry and uh and I ran over here as quickly as I could\nI heard that someone who oversaw the synagogue previously that you guys have had discussions in the past about this kind of situation the FBI stomach consulted on this kind of thing is that is that the case\nUm yeah that is correct we've done lots of training a on a on things like active shooters um and we've looked at a hardening facilities as much as possible\nDescribed for me how many people would have been inside a synagogue on a Saturday morning and what types of people would have been in there but they would have been doing\nSo I I I Can't tell you exactly how many were in there it depends if there was some type of a bar mitzvah or other special event which would would bring more people\nI Would guess that tree of life a typical Saturday morning would have at that time in the morning maybe fifty sixty people I I guess you're not going to be able to do what did he passed along the same\nAge he just said both do everything he can the city will do everything it can to help out and I'm I'm from Keith Rothfus this morning who's on his way here as well\nI'm really appreciate all the help from our our local politicians\nDo you have a security guard there during a Saturday morning services how they get security an issue for for you guys\nI'm I'm not a member a tree of life I I I Can't comment on their security practices I like to talk to someone from the congregation\nAnd officers you know we just heard from 'em a Christ talking to read that there are at least one you know he was in custody of the uh the shooters in custody hearing that and then after what's been happening this morning how does that make you feel sir\nI'm now I'm just sad I'm I'm really um I I don't know what to tell you I I just my heart goes out to all these families um the should not be happening\nPeriod it should not be happening in a synagogue it should not be happening in our neighborhood here in ...\nOne of the members of the Jewish Federation of presidents back to the Jewish Federation in Pittsburgh who is on scene\nIn squirrel hill the neighborhood of Pittsburgh where the tree of life synagogue came under fire established services were underway the gun minutes now in custody but not before shooting multiple people including three police officers\nThe exact numbers of dead and wounded have not been made clear but President Trump's tweet said there are multiple the Taliban is I'm Aaron ... you're listening to live coverage from ABC News\nABC News consultant John cones here with us a formula that department of homeland security John I Know you've been in contact\nWith a security officials for religious institutions how will they be reacting to what's going on here in Pittsburgh\n[noise] yeah I've spoken so I've been in contact with security officials from a Christian school ready they the Jewish community at and there are ... and others and there are monitoring the situation closely one of the uh uh more valuable\nUh results of the unfortunate\nNeed to have to enhance security around with faith institutions a or a faith based facilities at the security leaders from all these major religion in the United states has formed a very tight network that come\nThat comes together during moments of crisis such as that so is the the security officials from these different state organizations are in communication with each other or they share information with each other and then the individual security officials at take steps but then there on\nA vacation or their own faith community I to judge had security as necessary\nOr John going a of a formerly department of homeland security and now an ABC News consultant as we wait for additional details from Pittsburgh Police after they took a gunman into custody they're now going through the synagogue bit by bit to try and see if there is any additional thread\nTo see how that may be going on which Franco formerly of the FBI now an ABC News consultants with us up rich how do they do this\nIf they will I'm Sorry I lost you\nFor holidays not searching this building now uh you know just a bit by bit how does that search go a while they don't get that suspect uh you know taken away from the scene\nYeah sorry I'm so so there will be going through it as if there is still an active shooter in there it will be slow it will be methodical um there's actually a term a slow as fast so they will go from room to room and they will make sure that any hiding place with in that facility\nIs check to make sure that there is no a active shooter they will also I'm bringing in a most likely I'm a the a bomb dogs and also um ah ah those investigators who are trained in detecting um by making material\nJust to make sure that there were no other types of devices in there that could be used as a secondary uh attack against the officers um most of the time in fact all the time when these officers will go out on this type of a", "year": "2018",
