I ... my chances if Democrats win the Senate um again if everything from certain today the election were held today or you know I had a probably a twenty five percent\nChance of the Democrats taking the Senate I think it's probably lower to Fifteen or twenty again flushing change between\nNow and election day uh but that that that I'm a given\nRecent polling that has definitely approach the Democrats a behind the eight ball in the Senate side on the house side I think I'm I'm Still the same um it's probably you know a\nTwo thirds of it you know sixty six percent chance that the Democrats take house you've got sixty nine districts Republican districts tossup districts meaning Republican districts I think in play and probably only a handful of democratic districts\nReally in play a and I'm Talking about less than five so if these models\nThat you talked about over in prior years are true and and and stand up and hold off I should say and\nIf this if the Democrat crime if the Democrats turned out in this general as they have in the Democratic\nPrimaries this year um specially in Nineteen sixty nine that I definitely see the Democrats missing it move here and it's going to come down to states like California or Pennsylvania New York New Jersey\nJT Taylor always a pleasure thank you for spending some time here with us on investing sense\nAndy are always good to be a junior team and we'll talk to you and a few weeks\nAgain that was JT Taylor managing director chief political strategist there at hedge I Potomac research or when Jay teen I have a chance to talk we cover a lot of material this was no exception a kind of the after effects of Kavanaugh or what he sees going into mid terms or the greater implications for China\nAnd and what would that be going forward so we only aired a little bit here but there's the full break there and investing sense dot com go listen to that because there is a ton more there for you to kind of digest at investing sense dot\nCom now it's on to some very good news from the financial publications barons so every year barons ranks the country's top independent financial advisors and the parents came out with her most recent ranking a couple of weeks ago\nAnd a familiar name appeared on the list for the first time and I got to and it was a very good ranking for a debut on the\nList financial engines is incredibly proud to be named to barons list of top independent investment advisors\nOr you know this is our first time on the list we debuted at number twelve that was out of forty firms that that barons ranked this year I interestingly enough barons expanded the list from thirty to forty spots this year and a lot of that was due to this just kind of incredible growth that we're seeing in the industry\nThere is another piece to the parents article that that has even more positive and optimistic news and that's because as parents put a private equity firm Helmand and Friedman bought financial engines for three billion dollars and moved to combine it with Edelman financial services\nAnd so that that's great news about where did Edelman financial services show up in the barons list top spot number one Edelman financial number one ranked from on the barons less so the two firms combined financial engines and Edelman financial lab that's pretty much the top dog in the industry now\nSo as you might imagine the deal generated a ton of bugs in the industry a financial planning called this a major deal in the industry or Michael kids has said that it's a brilliant deal these or you know his words it's a brilliant deal at a size and scale that few others have ever attempted\nSo you know while we know that there's going to be a lot of eyes on us right now we are absolutely going to stay focused

on\nFor the client to be able to reach that goal\nAnd so was twenty Seventeen it was a a banner year for the market uh you know your stocks have probably done well here over the summer months\nBut it

eight three three eight six three seven mark thanks for calling how can we help\nThem in years old and he would like to start a rod IRA he works in a family business and getting paid and wanted to get started in Iraq Iran not sure what kind of a fun way to put that in its planet you\nPut money into it for four or five years and they just leave it and let it go they'll just trying to get in fights with bin Laden where for him to quit my or start off\nMark good for you here for helping your son get started like this I I might have you reconsider having your son put money into this Roth IRA instead a thing about opening a brokerage account and that would have everything to do with you having a little bit more flexibility and option analogy with with the money\nSo that tax free benefit of the Roth that you feel better about their ability of the brokerage account the ...\nYeah maybe a and really this demand for flexibility is a function of his son's age okay either way or the portfolio that I've been recommending for young investors like your son is our sixty thirty ten portfolio and ah so these are the allegations to three different athletic\nClasses that your son might consider that going to talk investments because it's just kind of broad ethic classes okay\nSo sixty percent allocated to the ... five hundred a large kept stocks got thirty percent thing about allocating too small kept stocks that last ten percent or maybe think about a core bond fund\nSo that you can kinda round out the portfolio but this is a this is a personal portfolio could get your son started saving for a very long term goal\nUh you know retirement could be a starting point for buying a house getting married could get him squared away for some other life events you know that he would see in the next five to ten years but just think that sixty thirty ten and and go from there so\nComing up on the show Andy is set to get deep end to this week's portfolio reviewing this week he'll be

dot com\nAnd now back to financial engines investing sense with Bob Richards a nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith with just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question for me and calling from Massachusetts hello any\nKind of fell on my question is forty eight yeah so um my husband\nAnd I make seven thousand dollars I only have about eight thousand tonight thousands of dollars on a friday IRA and that would like to watch\nThe football effectively diet maybe one out of any of that is my question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so we kind of on top of that then you said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money or you know socked away or inside the raw ... here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA um and then you know the same could go for your husband as well\nSo with your author raise each of you can contribute\nUp to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifty but maybe before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nMy younger than ... they'll say\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year when I\nWhen we know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however longer working you plan on saving\nFifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty and then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between eight fifty in Seventy now when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy the other thing I Want\nTo do that but at this point choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe ... the less you have to pull from your investments or you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now\nNo tail that\nPerfect alright so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nAh no okay I I I don't want a house I'm going to face Fifteen fucking when it went right now okay\nSo I feel like I used to own a house before my mortgage was so funny that a lot of fucking round it out I I'm okay Shane\nOkay I'm I'm putting money away for something for\nOur perfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play 'em so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks we're sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email I go\nOkay um when you are in a position to send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask Andy\nAt investing
