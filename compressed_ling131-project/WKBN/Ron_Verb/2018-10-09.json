Pompeo is sounding optimistic after another meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong un\nJust days after the president said he fell in love with the north Korean dictator secretary of state Pompeo says his latest meeting was successful\nJohn Boccieri has done absolutely nothing about that\nZero so all of\nMy local officials that could that say the following thing we need to take more of your money because we're not getting our local or rain or we're not getting our local government fun back from the state\nThose officials to tell me that if those Democrats are all supporting\nThe same Democrats who have it done a damn thing about it they haven't done anything about it the zero\n\nNothing so they've done nothing about it do you see the piracy of this so you're putting your party the thing you're complaining most about that you claim is hurting your community and yet you would vote for the same people who've done nothing about it\nAnd expect different results what do they define insanity is isn't that what they define insanity doing the same thing over and expecting different results you're following saying they all say the same thing the Democrats in a all supports the Democrats who've been in office who've done nothing about it number one\nI think that's stupid\nI think that's putting party before your position\n[noise] the number two thing that ... that ah I hear\nIs it's the gasoline tax we pay which is fifty cents on a gallon state and federal tax okay so when you go to here in Ohio when you go out and you see uh\nLike the sign that says two Seventy\nYou're really paying two twenty for the gas because of the two Seventy price it's on the sign out their fifty cents of that is federal and state tax and Ohio wrote tax so yes it's really only costing you to twenty fifty cents of what you're paying on every gallon is going to the government's [noise]\nAnd you hear from county engineers and justifiably so what we know what the gas taxes we divided equally among Ohio's eighty eight counties\n\nIt doesn't have anything to do with how many road ... bar in each county it has nothing to do with how instead of saying that you know ... ... here's\nA the the pool of money we divided by eighty eight everybody gets that shrunk it doesn't matter if you have it has nothing to do with the road miles that you have the gas fun money which is crazy\nSo\nThe gas tax money should be allocated based on how many road miles you have for county engineers you follow what I'm saying it should be so some counties will get more and some counties will get less\nBut some counties are more roads that they have to deal with like we do here in ... county and other counties\nHave substantially less you see what I'm saying\nAnother major problem county engineers will tell you about in counties like moaning county it's a big problem for ... in my home county because we take the gas tax divided by eighty eight he gets the same Porsche money aside as other counties which don't have as many county roads\nMile wise that's crazy none of these state reps have done a damn thing about it so here's two of the most important issues in this community two of the most important\nIssues in this community that have a direct\nEffect on all of us\nTwo of the single most important issues that have a direct effect on all of us\n\nAnd none of these state reps have done anything about this zero nothing in the ten year that they've been there now these are two of the most important issues facing local governments and they've done absolutely nothing about him\nWhy would you support sending them back\nCertainly if you're an elected official I don't care if you're in the same party not why would you say\nI'm going to go with that guy that guy isn't done anything why would you support that why would you support that as a citizen of a community\nDon't you think you deserve better\nRepresentation better results yes no\nI Want you to seriously think about that don't you think you deserve better because all these local communities that are asking for you\nTo take more of your money out of your pocket which has already got enough being taken out of use that as the reasoning for it\n\nAs opposed to saying we stayed wraps and state senators haven't done a damn thing about it yet they support the same guys because they're in the same party\n\nSo that's what I think about when I'm Out and about and I see a John Doe Sherry sign\nI think he hasn't done anything why do you have a sign in your yard saying John Boccieri state Senate he hasn't done anything he certainly isn't done a damn thing about the two biggest problems zero\n\nMichel ... parents have done a damn thing is zero about those two problems nothing so why would you\nPut a sign in your yard and say\nThat's who I'm voting for it doesn't make a damn bit of sense to me I look at that and I think well what because he's a Democrat or or why these are nice guy and I just think the people even understand what's going on\nTo have a clue\nAnd that's why I won't vote for the same people\nI absolutely will not\n\nI'm not going to say well I Would vote for the same people I've said before I vote for Michael really\nI thought he did a good job at a school board I Want to see what he can do\nLet's see what he can do in four years\nAnd if you don't get anything done and I try someone else but let's see what he can do let's see what Dave Simon can do\n\nLet's see what they can do that just makes sense to me why wouldn't\nI Try someone else these people start to think these are there jobs they're entitled to them because you keep electing him time and time again and you keep getting mediocre results\nI sincerely mean the same thing for congressman Tim Ryan he's been a congressman for sixteen years can you think I'm not sure what he's done\n\nOther than disagree with the president on everything\n\nWe have the lowest unemployment since Nineteen sixty nine we have NAFTA renegotiated fair to the United\nStates with Canada and Mexico going after China\nAnother big problem that we directly affects our community NAFTA dumping from China manipulating currency going after them\nAnd ...\n\nGood sides with the party of mob mentality that ... the sides with the party of mob mentality\nLet's disrupt the hearing let's get into faces of elected officials because we don't agree with them going in and out of their office let's bug them when they're sitting down for dinner this is the Democratic party this is the party that there with the causes mayhem\nThe party that says well you have to accept everybody homosexual marriage transgender whatever and you have to accept to everything but we don't accept conservative speakers we don't accept people who don't vote our way and we cause we have a mob mentality that party\nThat's the party a Tim Ryan that's the ... Democratic Party it certainly is a good John F. Kennedy Democratic Party it's a whole new animal out there\n\nSo why would you say boy I'm going to stick with Tim Ryan does he think that this is his job forever never worked in the private sector\n\nHe spent a politician making what a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars a year and gold plated benefits in retirement state rep sixty thousand dollars a year and gold plated benefits and retirement\nStart doing twenty seven forecasts brought to buy ... cigar box and Gerard Lewis tonight's going to be down to sixty five sunny and gorgeous out there right now the morals going to be a great day increasing clouds dry eighty two fried sixty furlough showers or storms eighty percent chance on Thursday sixty nine for high forty seven furlough high friday fifty two\nWith the lake effect showers right now eighty five ... radio five Seventy ... let's take some calls\nA news radio five Seventy ...

I point out you had that a place to did uh the the rehab and Austin Town over there by the sandwich factory\nIt when when they got busted for Medicaid or mishandling\nThe whole place closed down because all the money that was coming in what is your medicate tax dollars so none of these people that private sector insurance you weren't paying four hundred dollars a day for all these people who decided to do drugs now you got to issue to locally that wants to take more your money and pay for that are you out of your mind\nWhat about the coach he said that closed and I got a buddy go to jail with all the money they stole no no we have a president can serve two terms which ... here's why are we have representatives\nCongressmen and senators twenty thirty forty years actually and I keep coming back to him and also to like you got one president at the United states that's what I Want to say\nThank you for saying that\nYou ran for ... but I like the way you have a child\nI appreciate that and it does mean a lot to me it really does the problem in politics today is you are not to focus\nYou are not to focus\nWhether you and I agree I'm going to say the million times we are taking too much of your money if you're a productive taxpaying citizen we're taking too much of your money in all forms of government are wasting in passing away too much of your money they are not run efficiently\nEvery year there's something on the ballot to increase your property taxes every single year I Can't imagine what my property taxes will be five years from now they're already over four thousand dollars a year in a in a regular home I live in a joke Koch construction house\nTo regular house minor four thousand dollars\nI been supporting my schools I've been supporting my fire department I've been supporting my place I you know at what point do I do I say should I let my property taxes go to five thousand six thousand seven 'cause every year it's it's it's always when we need a little more for this little more for that\n\nI'm telling you now the library's got more money and they know what to do with news radio ... and that was something else people voted for news radio five Seventy nobody can be an Enron from Andrew in Salem it's for an older one boardman hello\nHey Ron how're you doing I'm I heard your intro and uh I really agreed with a lot of what you're saying in terms of this criticism of\nWhat's going on with is a so called lame duck Congress man I Know you harp on in Ryan a lot I think he lived in his district um I think that the issue really at hand here is is the gerrymandered district because\nThe more gerrymandered district is then the more safe that district is for which I whoever the incumbent is so so why do they have to do anything different if they're going to get reelected you mean example I live just south of you my congressman bill Johnson different political party he happened to be a Republican\nUm he got he got elected in two thousand ten and the Tea Party wave and ran on in the anti AC a platform\nAnd the lead up to the twenty twelve election he was you know running again and he kept telling this repeal and replace repeal and replace why called his office during that time and ask them well where do you replace man you know you say this I Want to look at specific since he is something I can get any high now the eighth yeah it's not perfect we all know that\nAnd I was always told you know keep your eye out in the next few weeks you'll see something we'll post it you know what's been checking back everything there's still NO PLAN he hasn't done anything he's been in there if he gets elected this fall he'll by the end of his next time it'll\nBe in their decade well let me ... let me play it safe district you know he doesn't have to do it\nWell let me bound to suffer your first of all I think the health care situation well hang on I got applause someone to\nCome back to you you're asking some good

Tiffany boulevard and boredom Enron for news radio find somebody you know when you\n... where was I talking to Andrew was talking to you\nYeah All right go ahead with oh ... okay here's a here's why I support bill Johnson I'm just going to answer your question I'm going to a if it's not my district but I Would vote for Bill Johnson because bill Johnson supports President Trump I voted for Trump\nAs an American I like what he's doing I think the country's going in the right direction\nAnd I would vote for somebody that will support the president I also think when you ask about health care it's up to the I think that's an issue that has to be dealt with a by the presidents and by the leadership to come up with a better idea in a better plan\nAnd I hope that the Trump Administration will get to that because I think it's one of the biggest problems facing as I was talking yesterday to a guy who was talking to me about ... Seventeen hundred dollars a month for his family Seventeen hundred a month\nWith a five thousand dollar deductible about what you think about that Seventeen thousand don't get any help from the government or anything like that\nThis is a major problem is a small business guy but as a matter of fact there was another person to do also paid Seventeen hundred and one that pays twelve hundred this is just in the last handful of days it is it is devastating to individuals and family owned businesses are small businesses\nThe costs are devastating to companies here I worked for the largest broadcast companies in the country I heard media\nWhere I pay where they pay two thirds that I pay a third of the cost so it's substantial what comes out of our check for our health care which is a high deductible plan\nThey don't pay anything 'til you pay three thousand dollars\nOr I don't know how companies can afford it I don't either vigils can afford it I think it's something that Trump needs to deal with and I don't know that there's an easy answer to it either because I don't think it's cheap I think a lot of these tests are very expensive\nYou have to answer obligation we're all night until proven guilty and a lot of Democrats can't wrap their mind around\nA lot of Republicans who have made a statement ah well I Believe her story\nBut and they say well if you believe or that means you believe or that means you accept it how can you do that\nThe problem is is dumping sales into the political correct fascism where would they do they take situations in the label it and now if you want to talk about it you have to make a pre disclaimer statement before you say anything that well I accept the political correct premise of\nAll women should we believe it or whatever the situation is because if you don't make be free disclaimer statement than anything you say after that is wrong\nNo credit and your and ugly and moral horrible person\nThese people are forced into this quick sand to how they if they don't say in pre qualify you know well I Believe her story and everything but you know blah blah blah well that's why they're saying that that's why there's a disconnect because with the political correct you know fascism you can't just do what they should have said was\nOr after that me and said well you know I heard the story I heard both sides and um you know quite frankly I don't believe or I don't make it as weight I don't think it has\n... there's no I write you know the end and it's done but you\nCan't say that you have to say first while you're just like a Seinfeld episode about they thought they were gay and they had fun with it because they had to keep saying not that there's anything wrong with that you know you have to qualify so that's why you know they can't wrap our mind around these people saying I Believe her but just because they have to say they have to say they believe it\n[noise] All right thank you there's nothing believable or the story to me news radio find somebody to give you an ... let's go next to John in Struthers Hi John\nHi Ron listen my real simple um these liberals I just don't understand them um when President Trump or pass the tax cuts not one Democrat Senator voted for the tax cut\nHow stupid how much of an embassy those are the liberals\nThat they're going to vote for somebody to go back in the office that pulled them I Know more about spending your money things you do hobby I have all the liberal policies how do you get past that when they're telling right to your face\nI Want your money 'cause I Know how to spend it better than you do I don't have anybody explain that to me to make sense\n'cause they can't make sense I'll say to you like you said a million times the best place for your money is in your pocket too much of your money is taken from you and wasted by government government has gotten too big trying to take care of too many people and it's giving the point where it's to a costly and taxes are too high and we cannot continue to go down this course\nAnd we don't have a\nGood leadership on any of those funds on all of all fronts federal state and local\nExactly and one other thing and I'll let you go I was talking to young lady liberal and she told me and I'm paraphrasing that baby boomer white men are responsible for all the things that are wrong with this country today\nThat's nonsense I mean that was a blanket statement\nWell I got him playing it right I mean people can make stupid statements nonsense there's plenty of reasons why we are where we are let's start with the basic premise that a lot of people don't take personal responsibility for the decisions that they make in their life and think somebody else should be responsible for paying for those bad decisions\nIf you make a decision to put a needle in your arm it's an illness not a bad decision no it's a bad decision not an illness okay\nExactly exactly I my friend thank you thank\nYou I mean that's what it is I'm not going to sugarcoat any of this stuff that isn't an illness that's a bad decision now you got a problem as a result of making a bad decision\nYou go out and buy a car you can't afford because you can get a loan on it and then they come and say six months later we're going to hook the car and take it away from you that's a bad decision you made\nThat is not an illness that you decided to buy something you couldn't afford\nNews radio find somebody that can be on Mike in pains they'll run in boardman hello\nHey Ron ... man hey listen I I like to explain the anger on a laugh\nOr any like ... man why the Democrat politicians are push well when you know always says you Republicans you white guys you need to reach out to\nMinority engage in this part of why yeah yeah\nWhat the Democrats meanwhile they reach out you have to offer each ... something and that's exactly what the Democrats have been doing they've been saying\nWe're coming to our party will give you this war is that a pound of flesh out of the people for that well we'll put these people in their place for that and so what's going on is they've created their constituents and you can liken it to a Franken's\nFrankenstein made of this group and that net net and it is a mystery because it's the Democrat Party can't deliver all those promises so what they're doing\nIs before that Frankenstein turns on them they're pointing their finger Republicans are saying it's the Republicans that are keeping you from this and that and\nThat's exactly what Nineteen thirty nine Nineteen thirty eight ... party is with the Jews the only difference is\nThe last ... or like it when when Frank stay gets out of control starts burning down villages it's\nGoing to get real ugly for [noise] so what they're doing or politicians are going before that Frank as science turns on them\nTheir directing that anger for all of us early white men you know we're not protected class\nAnd that is why do so\nWell I I ... I I I blame the Republicans I think it's ridiculous\nThe police to help convict the crooks\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a bad like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or why are free set up in minutes and run on to double the batteries last up to two years Bree in technology\nAnd yeah I like Frank Frank the good guy didn't mean to go after you anyway [noise] I don't know what the answer is here to to uh to health care I mean I I don't know that there is an easy answer to you\nIt's multi prong you know the first thing would be getting older people\nOut of the insurance market\nAnd the other thing would be if we ended corporate personally person that way drug companies won't be able to advertise on TV how much of their budget goes for advertising and that drives up the cost of prescription and then they wouldn't be allowed to lobby politicians the insurance industry or the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd they they contribute big of both parties they own\nTheir own people in D.C on in both parties on both sides of the issue they never come out getting hurt\nIt's made in you and everybody off but ends up paying more because of it\nAnd I and I don't know where it's where it's going to have like you said it's ... in the last three days two days three different people twelve hundred a month and two it's Seventeen hundred a month\nBoth with high deductible how are you know how do you do that\n... it's it's hard to imagine paying a monthly and then you got a big deductible on top of it just for the coverage\nOf it but I understand also cat scans and PET scans but can you tell me why why is that if I go to this place to get a a like today I haven't for whatever reason are some problems with my right he appear\nSo I had to go get an X ray so I so I did what I tell you guys to do I said to my doctor I said I I I'm going to be ... because I'm going to pay a lot I got to pay for this summer to pay a lot less if I go to ... by as opposed to if I go anywhere else for this X ray\nYou know I'm cognizant of it because it's my money right if the insurance is paying it maybe people don't think as much but you're going to pay more in the ... it was a little while at\nTimes to get the insurance company tells you where you have to go\nOh yeah they control your doctor's there's no question about that you're absolutely right but I I don't know that Medicare Frank is the answer because when they were talking about Medicare for everybody you'd have to triple a taxes or something it was ridiculous so that\nUh we got to do something on the coverage I I didn't like my wife says to me the people that this is not like the old days these tests are not that they're not inexpensive and they never will be ... I mean so I don't know what the answer is to all this stuff\nWell like I said I think we have to if you're older people out of the church you know and I talked to my brother does she comes up a lot of these great ideas actually and the way explains it made such people that are over ...\nAnd ... and actually that would actually help the economy too because a lot of people over fifty have enough money to retire if they didn't have to buy health insurance that would create jobs for the younger creep\n[noise] well two things on that though Medicare is not in the greatest financial shape as we speak uh to to begin with and\nJust as a side note you pay about ... uh one and a quarter percent taxes income tax on Medicare so\nAnd then my boss has to match\nOn top of it is a very much you pay so if we did raise that tax I Would be okay with that because you're you're getting something very ... very worthwhile from that so I'm not opposed to that but\nYou're going to pay taxes for something you just got to ask yourself what kind of country do I want to be when it's all said\nWell what do I want to pay for\nIt right I I think you ... I don't think you can a as a community you can expect people to pay more\nIn taxes I think you're paying enough in Texas I really think we have to take a look at spending and frugality on where the tax dollars are going because I really think the system on all levels is going to go\nDown the tubes I I don't blame people can afford a lot more property tax or any other taxes at all I just don't think it's a affordable so we'd better take a look at what's what the answer right I\nI pretty much a separate point there myself we're ... we're paying it off for\nCorrect you know because you you can only afford so much a community has to learn that this is what we have and this is what we can afford we can always go back to people and say we want to take more of your money [noise] uh because we're pricing people out of their home is very important\nIn finding all that right now here in our house because they want to do another tax Larry but like I said I think they should wait until the governor's race is over\nBecause Cordray is running aren't sending money back to the community if he wins and he does that I might fix law these problems we don't have to open up our wallets and give money to a school district that just waste money and there's not really mindful spending other people's money\nHe doesn't so I don't get it and\nWe don't have enough people telling them what the tax\nCut is doing for them\nOh well we we need more of that rally\nListened and when you when you talk to a property taxes here so local economic picture and I want you to think about this\nTwo thirds of large town is closed because they got rid of the third shift in a second shift you follow you follow what I'm saying they got rid of that second and third shift so if I say to you you know because people are saying the future of large town is fifty fifty as far as you know the ... they're not making a commitment\nThe GM large town you find that that that I don't care goes so they're not making a commitment about anything but the reality is I\nNoticed well just to just hang on a second two thirds of large town is is gone away people it no longer there the third shift in a second ship north side hospital is gone away how do you go to people and say we need you to ... how do you go to people and say we want you to pay more in property taxes for anything\nBased on what I just said a bunch of people that lost their jobs and the third and second shift that don't have their jobs and the north side hospital close how do you ask those people to pay more I mean what kind of politicians do we have\nSeriously\nWe really need politicians and know how to get money back\nRight and I are more efficient gave money back name in a very thank you my mom more I got to go I'll be back\n... kind of a
