{"month": "10", "state": "OH", "station": "WKBN", "content": "A week I had the chills I was getting pale\nI said guys I don't know I don't feel that great\nCarlos on a chair with will seize flip that share the other end of the room ... he broke a land\nSpeed record and I think his shirt over ... have you had to get out of here I spent the next three days he couldn't lift my head off the pillow in bed just deathly\nI immediately threw you out of here and once I get you out of here I then went over to wear Moses sets of eyes sanitize the whole thing before I took care of any\nI I did I not sanitizing your town or your microphone everything most as I said Moses I Can't risk you getting sick I felt so guilty missing the show too I did I felt so guilty I'm like what if we would've caught whatever you had\nYou we will get better [laughter]\nSo you're a couple of days right yet dropped down your what you were really sick I Will do\nWhatever that was so that that was a classic day wasn't about to just sanitized my CDs ties yours who's did I Do first Moses well I I agree\nI mean I have your time I came back and you guys had hazmat suits and then I got rid of whatever ...\nWe are right so let's take some questions Jeff you're on with the attorneys go ahead\nYeah the question I have a child support case I'm currently the pay or but my child has moved in with me fulltime having the pay no longer come from me\nYou have to file a motion you have to file a motion what the court whichever court issued the support order\nHas jurisdiction to hear any subsequent changes the circumstances which would trigger a change in the order so you were the ... the court considers you the ... but now you that your physical custody my advice would be to file a motion to modify custody because they don't recognize that you have physical custody\nSo they have to grant you physical custody and then they have to modify support so your grounds to filed a motion to modify custody would be that I currently have custody\nAnd and if there's you know the the other parent opposes you you just site how long you've had custody well I've had custody last six months or the last year and now that I filed a motion for for to modify support you're going to say that I don't\nSo that's what I advise I thank you very much good luck\nThank you know news radio five Seventy two and it can be an Georgia Iran with most of the ... the legal show brought to buy ...\nI'm Ron how're you doing today okay George Hi Dolores dawn I'd had George hello I'm not playing around with my voice real\nYou know it sounds it sounds like a guy trying to sound sexy though you know I Am actually\nI think you know in a strange way I said this guy's probably sexy about a lot of callers though and I'm an idiot he's going to\nA question which lawyer there from Pennsylvania\nAttorney Carl Moses middle initial ... am where's your office fat in her message that's harming each yes\nThat's not right outside of Philly\nI'm Sorry ... yes\nIt's in her message or you know her messages right across the state line\nIt's it's a adjacent to share and other than you are you familiar with that area\nYeah what rod is on a size Eighteen yes Rudy team\nAnd okay I have a question I Want to know what's the time out on on contesting it will\nIn Pennsylvania yes\nI don't know the answer to that quite frankly I'd have to have to look that up how long has it been scholar\nOh probably about a year and a half I guess\nWe'll has there been they closed the state that's what I was\nStaying with class but there are some questions about the state [noise]\nWhy don't you ask him at the time the lore and wouldn't even talk to me\nWell you could have filed some sort of an objection well eat\nThe more or less wanted me out of the office\nWhat were you doing it irritated him so much a blessed thing are you talking about your lawyer\nI don't know that the lawyer that they were my father my father I N K uh I've worked for my dad for thirty plus years\nOkay he passed away he promised land prophecy that I Would get the business and and now all along the old whenever my father passed away when you're in good standing with each other sisters and Arab all then hair to the home and everything\nWe're not All right where they named into will the sisters yes\nThey are both named ...\nHe'd have a right to exclude you if you wanted to end his will and other words uh uh I don't think you have any right if he in fact unless you can show there was some sort of a verbally worse use right on a ... there's the thing you\nKnow sure you're okay my name is George chain that met on the show and on the wheel George at my middle initial\nThought you said he was not leaving you anything for a deal late\nMay at that time and the wheel and it meant well\nThough the grounds to contest to will in Pennsylvania I just look this up is that you could alleged that there was a procedural mistake in the making of the will have a fraud\nStill and will or one that is a forgery\nOr that the test state or ... that made the will did so because he was under duress from another beneficiary so those are all good grounds have you say you're the other beneficiaries put put put them under duress to leave you out of the will those may be grounds to contested however the statute of limitations in Pennsylvania's a year years\nI was gonna say five years so you can't let me up to me a year when the date is open\nHang on I think I get what this guy is saying okay just hang on a second argue claiming I'm reading between the lines are you're claiming you think that somebody else tampered with that will to exclude you and it wasn't your father's original\nDie very part because he had your middle name wrong very possible could detect\nA signature I've had my ... years I Know he signed the same everybody OK signature on a couple of pieces of paper will did not look like you said the troops now that I think I got I got a letter in the mail and the other day okay\nThat the business was closed up for like five years prior to his death\nNow and in a letter in the mail I got a check addressed to me for ten thousand dollars and when it says to my son George ... my death that he he shall we saved ten thousand dollars and a checkers right out in my name and that and then a signature on it\nWell now did you did you present any of this evidence what was going\nTo wait a minute I just got to check in the mail but last week from whom don't know\nI don't mind it don't it it said on there I Am trying to think out in the little note said I'm Sorry that I didn't finish you enough time but I Hope you cash in on this you\nBetter you better see a lawyer yeah who deals in states\nActually what you yeah go go see a probate lawyer I hear him right he just got this check after a year later and you have no idea who is who sued the check is from\nNow jets from my father started this this jak already been passed on for how long now he's a little over a year by year free month\nBut he signed it in in er the funds there if you go to cash it\nI Know that this was about a year or two before I'm\nSupposed to check more than anything I don't know I\nKnow there's probably can you ... closed it's and that's the efforts closed account which still\nCan I own the state for this\nYou have to see in the late yeah you'd have to yeah to because it sounds like you would have grounds to this newly discovered evidence it may be evidence of fraud or duress so that the you know the court in Pennsylvania I'm not Pennsylvania lawyer and and Carl doesn't practice that much probate now but\nUh they may expand on the statute of limitations beyond a year in in your particular case you're going to show fraud\nWhich you have to do is I got to prove ... listen to sit down was ... was a tablet and put her and make out of now make up an outline so that when you do see a lawyer it'll be it'll be in in chronological order\nA time was and you tell the lawyer everything and make a copy of the outline give him a copy that'll save a lot of time and ah it'll it'll get you better advice though\nDo you think you hang on to say do you think your sister's answer my question do you think your sister's put the screws to you yes or no\nWell I Believe I sort of do yes\nAll right and not just to answer these questions what do what do you think would be their motivation did you not get along with your sisters\nNo I Love my fist always thought they love me\nSo why would they do something like you know I don't really do you think your father at any point changed his mind you pissed them off or anything yes or no\nI well here's a time when I got cancer I went to business I got very sick okay okay and they sold my told which I didn't recuperate some of the money for my two fold\nSo to state so that might be why he left a business to the sisters do you think because you couldn't do it\nThis is the business they don't say they regard\nYou may I interject ... was it was it a sizable state I mean was it was it a lot of money\nGet fat and that was it made checked my a few ... effect my ear as short\nAnd you've had problems since then is that correct\nI Can't I Can't I open my mouth wide enough eat an apple I have a Mac and lay on my left side I mean when I go to it hurts I got ringing in my ear intermittently\nKeep it at all but my ears are\nMost at all or keep in mind that\nYou're you yourself a cannot or you can testify against your pain and so for us if it came to litigation but you need a medical expert to be able to say what your injuries are so that's why I said to you it's important for you to follow up\nWith the medical people you may have to see a dentist\nUh in addition to a neurologist for the concussion so you've got a follow up or else you will not have proof of what your injuries are\nSo much my issue she loves them on the shore right now I'm between jobs and I don't have the arts and nobody you'll see\nWell that's what ... that's why it's important well All right I understand what you're saying eventually if no one will see you then go to the our\nAh that that your only option probably but I'm a lawyer so you're not getting the right you know he'll get a lawyer and a lawyer may take it on a contingent fee basis where you won't have to pay him anything and he gets to be out of whatever the recovery is\nNot what this the injury lawyer yeah lawyer\nIs there's malpractice this would be a lawyer who does medical malpractice because you're talking about standard of care did the hospital abide by the proper standards of care and providing security\nOkay like for example in most isn't the vacuum come to my studio I have to put a straight jacket on that so worried they are about my mental health\nAlright I Gotcha thank you sir good luck\nMakes it very difficult for me to function here but in a strange kind of way you get used to it\nWill pause and

I'm a I'm a faithful person so I think this is probably where I Need to be and maybe I'm here to try to help some people\nI'm a faithful person and that's why after every broadcast I go God why\n[laughter] All right ... you're on the air with attorney ... go ahead\nHi Ira thanks for taking my call I really appreciate it ah I bought a um [noise] one of those retractable uh on the deck\nDo yeah I Know what she told you so naturally I'm not going to mention the name I Know what you mean ... was it the automatic one or the crank won the automatic All right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go at ten and just eat straight through until two like started brunch breakfast and lunch\nAbsolutely Wilder and it's in Gray's rights that would be fun when you find out by the golf course so you know it's kind of cool All right next call jak marked effect you attorney law\nUnless they're direct hey jak taking my call you know you go ahead\nI'm I have a question of like a criminal case and that's not my case I'm a ... kind of familiar with the [noise] hey how are\nThe people that were ... they got married and the wife\nSaid she married when she didn't prevent him from a testify against her and that was just wondering if the crime was committed before the marriage is that ...\nNot so good that was actually a great question why did why did he marry her if if he knew that well you're you're talking about\nPrivileged communication okay and and you know lawyers and their clients habit doctors and their patients habit\nPriests and the people but they administer to have it but there are exceptions if a priest knows that someone in a confessional booth is going to kill somebody in a committed a crime then I think that the privileged there is no longer that privilege okay\nSo you could make it interesting arguments both ways one that they got married to create this privilege okay the privilege when this myth or information became known there was no privileged they weren't married\nBut you could say now they are married so she can't testify against her husband that's an interesting I think you could argue that both ways and I think it'd be a matter for the court to decide I don't think you can marry\nOr whatever then that was the case or the cause for the marriage\nThen I then I Would say I would argue that that's not privileged communication and that she ... she can be compelled to testify\nOkay\nI mean that's my position it may not be absolutely right I I'd like to research it a little further though much or not ... yeah I mean I might you know some things are just if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck if you're doing something\nTo try to get you out of doing something that you lawfully morally should do then you probably should have to do it any way that should not be your defense to to prevent you for having to test\nSo she married him so that he wouldn't testify against your that's what you're telling me correct yeah really all the guys I Know they marry the girl because well she's pregnant usually but uh so it's never I I've never heard of this\nLike your car after it and run or something like that\nRight well I was opposed a painting it ... right ... what was the crime was it a serious crime I Can't say I\nWill just say the answer is it a serious crime yeah yeah really yeah\nOh is he nervous being married to her now\n... well I Know they're they're both are incarcerated though\n... they're in jail now right oh well\nSo they're not even together then\nRight yeah are they ... they ... defendants and and on a on a case and\nThe the police's trying to get them to turn on each other\nA case here\nOh so they're trying to get one is so much on the other one right I think I saw something like this uh\nIf ... if either you or your spouse is the defendant in a court trial husband and wife privileged prevents the confidential communication from being used as evidence against you or your spouse so the privileged may prevent a wife from testifying against the husband if the husband was accused of dealing drugs or something like that\nUm oh wait a second\n[noise] the privilege maybe invoke than criminal or civil proceedings a marital confidences privileges only applied to communications made during the marriage and cannot be invoke a for communications before the marriage or after the marriage\nBut my guess was but nowhere near an attorney so well I appreciate that and now I think uh that information aren't or wherever ...\n... ... ... so so that's but yeah I mean if you really should ... information between the ...\n... talk between the wife and a husband that makes sense of you your husband and wife have communications it's ... privilege but if it's if it's your husband and wife and you have these communications there's no privilege so last night\nWhen my wife said to me ah get your hands off ... your big loser was that privilege [laughter]\nWasn't ... [laughter] well I mean it wasn't your religious right right right and uh she was denied and your friend was there last night right so that was that was like a privilege conversation that I probably should have told everybody right\nBut if there's a law suits you know for ... few get nominated for just ... yeah I Can't testify that right exactly can you imagine that this guy I mean it's hard for me to imagine folks that this ... the sky cab at all it's shocking to me\nIs I'm shocked he drank beer in\nCollege yeah you know why ... college ... yes you know what I'm so glad that I never drank beer in college so I'm never come back to haunt me [laughter] each race\nHere I mean I understand sometimes even occasionally a dark beer yeah not always ...\nBen Franklin said that's how you know God love dust because he created beer that was Ben Franklin blind and they lay some political clout back in the day I also here during his college time you listen allowed rock music [laughter] and [laughter] and whistle that girls yes\n... Ben Franklin was quite a lady and I am shocked by all those revelations that have come out by that that type of behavior where they find appalling yes it's ah it's ah should be just milk shakes and lollipops and that kinda stuff but you know from from my perspective folks\nDid you enjoy our stay together without ... you don't want ... look over there even though you're sitting in your usual ...

V. A. C. T. O. R. dot com and again go on there you are going to see success stories and the real people just like you that\nYou have questions uncertainty skepticism but you know you took that actions that they followed throwing it around one of the things we've talked about before is Mullins have a lot of people in the media business still you know your former colleague Robert Mann Gino did my program you know I have a morning show host right now on and on one\nOf our local I heart affiliates in Pittsburgh I mean he's down right now over thirty pounds of weight\nAnd one of the things that he says all the time says this is one of the best things that I've ever done before and I remember when he came and I'd be meeting tomorrow with another gentleman his on one of our sports guys I have a bunch of them tomorrow we're going to sit down and we're to talk to them and we're going to last strategy out so I'll tell you this program truly works you know if you're listening right now and you're saying I have that desire\nI just need some help that's where we come into play that game plan on\nIsn't the hardest part for anybody Dr factor if you step by step aside from you know being the guy in charge here and Dr factor isn't always the hardest part taken the first step to say I want to fix something well\nIt is and I think what it is running you know I've talked about this before but I think really what it is is is the first stop there was an embarrassment factor okay hey you know who wants to go to so many talk about weight it's nice nice a little bit uncomfortable but one of the things that we deal with it and that's about a guy gray\nBut one of the things that we do is we're never judgmental in our clinic you are going to meet an amazing team are going to be compassionate people they care about you\nThat are non judgmental I remember I walked in the room went down to leases and you're not going to believe this number she's I Can't even look this I said lady I met people would love to be in the number of your head\nBelieve me I Would love to get down there so we're never judgmental but the first thing you have to do the okay I'm getting excited from Bob in the first thing you have to do was ... I Can't do this on my own okay\nYou have to realize if you don't make a change what's going to happen you know we know right now and run on someone's overweight or some of the type two diabetic right now it caused a tremendous amount of money and it's going to cost them\nA tremendous amount of money later in life and people say all the time I had health insurance there's still there's out of pocket costs associated with it so the first step is it just is coming and\nTaking that time I had to sit down and say hey I'm going to check this out I'm going to see what it's about if somebody feels that it's not a good fit or they don't want to go forward there's never pressure never obligation one promise that I have for your listeners is they're going to leave with more information and they never had before and they're gonna leave with new information that I can tell you they're not hearing from anybody else\nAnd let me tell you why this was important when you mentioned a couple of things first of all we're seeing two things Dr factor we're seeing companies\nThat are insisting you know yearly when you get your health insurance you take a physical which includes like that body mass index\nNumber they insist that you take it because guess what it has a a bearing on your costs when it comes to your portion of your insurance ... your personal life style your weight do you smoke and all these things\nMake a difference on the cost of your health insurance\nAnother thing that I was reading is the cost of insulin Dr factor is going through the roof\nAnd if you got insurance plan like I Do here at the station folks where you've got a three thousand dollar deductible which means Dr factor I pay everything up until I get three thousand I pay for the prescriptions I pay for everything the insurance company doesn't do anything to like get beyond three thousand so folks if you're in a plan like that and more people are\nIn insolence continues to go up and cost and it's getting astronomical one's going on there\nThere's a way to deal with this fight back is by getting off of this stuff if you're a type two diabetic or a hundred\nPercent are writing these high tobacco plants you're ... you're only three thousand I think my family planning sixty five hundred if I'm not mistaken you know what else do I do [laughter] but any case but here's here's the point though and here's the key to okay\nYou're certainly right if you can cut down the costs and I just talked about this on a radio show the other day you know they're saying right now that the United states you know again you can look at these different numbers you know we spent ... again this is going back ten years ago the study says we spent a hundred and Ninety billion dollars on obesity cost okay more recently there saying when diabetics either right now it's ... pounds of dollars a year\nIs going out of pocket so I'm telling you these numbers are really real thinking about this for a second run and so the key point if somebody goes to apply for life insurance okay they look at a lot of indicators of your family history look if you're a smoker\nIf your body mass index is above thirty year consider higher risk you're going to pay more now the reality people said well why is that it's just like the smoker and I and I and I said it's before smoking cigarettes doesn't mean you're going to get lung cancer you agree with that\nIt increases your and yeah it certainly increases your risk my mom but I'm not saying smoking is a good thing just like being clinical obese doesn't mean you're going to die early\nHowever here's what they find out a life insurance companies where they looked at when they look at all this data on computers and I and I called this quite a bit\nIf you're a mean body mass index is about thirty your chance of prematurely dying early increases so guess what they're going to have you pay a higher premium just like we are if you're a smoker so I'm telling you one of the biggest things that anybody could do to cut down on their cost give themselves a better quality of life to feel better about himself\nIs get their body mass index under thirty doesn't mean they have to be pencil thin we just want to get them under control so they can become healthier\nOne thousand dollars now\nTwo hundred two hundred you'll get attacked confirming injury was hard radio in the\nIt's eating the right type of food is good quality lean proteins good quality fat sat there and you do those things in the right time of day in the right proportion I'm telling you what it satisfies your hunger\nRector you're making an excellent point to say sometimes you're eating food that fills you up at the time but whatever the whatever affected it has on you it makes you hungry I know exactly what you mean not that long afterwards you know my I have a bowl of cereal and it'll be hungry later on you know what I mean I have a son not exactly\nA thing as eggs are good for a lot of people don't realize that good quality red meat is good for you and we can go on and if you'll listen arenas and really dog I thought it was bad I thought eggs weren't so good I'm telling you stay away I always say this the box bag or stuff and they can't is not the best choices for you\nKnow you went you know people say give me a tip the home stay away from the box bag or can't stop try to eat more fresh fruits try to eat more lean protein strategy good quality fat\nI eat ... almost every day I bags and then my home and avocado probably every day also why because light that out of the kind of guess what happens it fills me up and I'm not hungry because it is good quality fat\nAnd this is a key point I Want our listeners to get to run right now is that doesn't make effect okay believe it or not it's not a fat and they see is that it's the bill ... inability to burn the stored fat and makes us that and that's an important\nKey I coach factor I should say instead
