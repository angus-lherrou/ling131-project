person or people who spend at least ten explosive devices to critics of President Trump or people he has criticized three of the packages were found this morning addressed a former vice president Biden and actor Robert Deniro one of them made it to CNN yesterday and we're learning more about that\nOf this when they see a military presence waiting for them\nOr at the border that should be interesting to see what happens\nWith that uh\nI Am a uh as I said I'm Amazed that anybody is an American that is a Democrat Republican conservative or liberal but it's an American\nI think we should all be concerned about people it's simply don't want to invade your country or who don't think the loss of the rules apply to them\nAnd without any type of medical check her background check or any or any of that kind of stuff you know\nFor whatever reason there seems to be like some of my fellow Americans to do not believe in borders do not believe in ice or immigration control they don't believe in borders they don't believe in ice they even think illegal should be able to votes I mean so there's many people feel that way about this situation\nAnd that's unfortunate you would think if there's something that should unify all of us as Americans who simply to say there's a legal way to come into the country period there work visas or green cards there's a legal way to come into our country take advantage of all of those\nBut this is not the way to come into our country an invasion or show of force that they have a seven thousand plus people heading here basically to just invade the country in the president's saying that's isn't going to happen\nSo we shall see what the story is there I was reading where supposedly ... uh Megan Kelly what you got to let go from ah NBC because of what she said about a on a show\nAbout black face in Halloween and this kind of stuff\nYou know I think we're reaching a dangerous point in our society where somebody can't even apologize you apologize for it to you know I think uh she apologized and said well I didn't mean to offend anybody but the answer any more is while you're apology isn't good enough now you have to be fired a which I think it's a troubling directions for\nUh people to go these days some more details about that coming up first break on a cell phone run although in the studio Tiffany boulevard and boardman hello there\nRon CERN political political canvasser yet let me check in every now and then on the uh out of the races going here yeah\n... well we got governor okay ah yeah in Newcastle area we got a competitive race or a state houses well Yes sir Kay yet just a quick rundown of numbers for yesterday\nOr two hundred and Seventy houses hundred and four people home forty four Democrats those forty four twenty six are going to be voting straight Republican\n... and let's see twenty six of the forty for some more than half\nYeah [laughter] and Republicans got a thirty eight out of forty two that committed devoting straight Republican while the other group or\nOther party registering pickups it couples said Republicans some said they're disgusting enough they're not going to vote and other things like that but uh [noise]\nThat that was up and in the city of new castle that um but this this area that getting close to the Republican territory\nRight but this is just you going door to door\nYeah I've I've been to almost six thousand houses face to face\nWhen now why are you doing that\nAnd we're working for one of the guys it's running\nAll right so you're actually a knocking on doors and talking to people do a lot of people to die and so there's still a lot of people tell you and your business get lost\nWe get about fifty five percent that actually answered the door I don't keep track of how many sound like their own but don't answer and less less than five percent tell us to get lost\nOkay\n'cause I I think we're at a time when people have a have a tendency to be very a protective of what they're doing and what their views are I think a lot of people like the ... they don't answer pollsters are they lie to them not in your particular case I think you know when you're going door to door you'd probably get a pretty good read on something like that\nOne on one they're more likely to ah talk honestly ... and it's right now they're afraid to put signs out for anybody whether they support\nTheir party candidate or the other party candidate\nIn justly so I mean you know their vote is private confidential\nI mean you know it's ah it's ridiculous I mean a lot of people just don't want to discuss it nor should they have to discuss it or defendants or argue for it\nI I agree with that this is another observation I make today in the area man looking down the street how does it have flags out\nAlmost every single one of them is a Democrat voted in the ... and the general election of two thousand sixteen and that may be the only time they voted in the past four years\nReally so they were voted for Trump is my guess I\nI don't ask but that's that's their voting record over the last four years\nYeah people seem to me a lot of people through their own town you know like I say I I'm not a I D O W settled fair mine I voted for Trump I'm satisfied with what he's doing I think he might go down so far as the best president in my lifetime I'm very pleased with what the president is doing at this point in time I'm extremely\nPleased with it and I don't know that we can reach an agreement it's like you know people say well ... agreement on stuff I think the sides are so different one sided thing is going more in the direction of socialism the other side is trying to ... keep America how it is capitalism and\nA one side is going to ... to a crazy extreme I think a changing America as we know it and not for the better\nDefinitely in agreement with you\nOr I keep me in a little Greg now\nBe careful see there you go door to door that's he kind of that that's the one way that you can learn what's going on out there\n\nYou know I just find it hard to believe anyone would say boy I'm going to vote for people to make it difficult for the president a continuous agenda when things seem to be going so well\nAnd on I don't care what any organized group says well our members are going to vote for the Democrats because a or a union I think a lot of union people say oh no I'm not I'm going for the guy who got rid of NAFTA hated it so much he renamed it uh and the guy that's going to secure our border\nAnd the guy that got our economy humming along\nI said a million times the best social program is a good\nJob in Trump's economy is creating more good jobs not some\nBasic income that we're just going to give people\nOr give their children were\nGoing to give you an opportunity to get a job and if it's not a good one a better one news radio five Seventy two when you can be an end run for\nLet's go next to Steve on a cell phone stuff on its run although hello\nHow are you doing buddy okay [noise] you know I Want to focus a this call on a one word compassion okay I'm sick of misuse of the word or the the the the ideology thought out at all if you were talking about\nThat'd be compassionate for these illegal it actually causes all most most issues to these social issues the Democrats support that they they don't we have to be compassionate towards the the legal that are coming up because of their chart and they don't have trials are looking into problems\nHow come how compassionate can you be as a person when you're willing to ruin a country\nThat literary helps more than almost the rest of the world combined we have to be able to help ourselves to help others\nYou know you want to bring people in the the legal into the country\nAnd holy hurting when we do that we are hurting the most of all people horrible people in this country which are the low skilled American workers because wants to an influx of low skilled illegal immigrants in the U.S just dry dock wages or keep stagnant\nAnd it takes low skilled worker ... American Jobs that's what it does we have them bringing diseases we have\nTens of thousands hundreds of thousands of crimes committed against American every year\nFor people that aren't even supposed to be here\n[noise] you want to talk about compassion for people where's your compassion to the vast majority you want to you you talked to have compassion for an extreme minority whereas the compassion for the majority\n[noise] mhm [noise] well uh I listen I've compassion for legal immigration into the country\nBut I'm not opposed to people that want to come here legally whether it's on work visas or whatever I I understand people want to escape maybe where they\nWhere they are for lack of opportunities are to get a better life I ... I fully understand that that's how most of us got here ancestors were courageous enough to do that\nSo I don't have a problem with people doing it in a legal fashion even knows you would consider the low skilled because I think we need a lot of people I think we got a lot of spoiled brat Americans\nThat won't do a lot of the jobs that require physical labor anymore I don't know why other than we're a bunch of bushes\nAnd I think as a result of that you need a lot of these folks to come to our country on work visas or green cards or whatever and I and I have no problem with them coming here

radio weekends boring time capsule\nSeventy ...\nLet's go to peed on a cell phone I beat\nOn let me get you off [laughter] okay I thought\nOh off in a show of Iran yeah okay\n[noise]\nYoung or what was the last ... ... jobs in shock\nWell I absolutely think it's time to give other people to shop listen to county auditor and moaning county Ralph me chimp who I think is does an excellent job is a guy that says it says exactly what you're saying we as a community are losing population and we're an older population\nAnd ... said whether these political leaders like it or not there's going to be regional as a nation because the tax base\nCannot afford what ah what is a is out there I mean you're you're losing population you know it's in your in half crazy stuff you still have the same number of counsel people in Youngstown even though you don't have anywhere close\nTo the same population\nUh so yeah these political people don't want to give up their paycheck\nAnd or their perception of power\nAh that's why it's so that we I support term limits in Youngstown I support term limits in Canfield [noise] you know people that are opposed to term limits just want to stay in office and don't want anyone else to run and think they own the office I'm a hundred percent for term limits\nA degree and every time I hear on the Internet\nAnd you read about the worst place to live most of our resolve these popping up\nWell I don't necessarily agree with that you know and I'm somewhat offended by it actually is a resident of the community uh so am I I don't think it's a bad place to live at all I think it's a yeah I mean obviously if you want sunshine and an ocean and nice weather well\nWe got we got a lot of cloudy days and so I mean\nIt it depends what you're looking for I mean I happen to like Ohio I got used to the weather but let's be realistic when people get older they have a tendency to leave here and go where they have nicer weather year round a lot of younger people leave because they want an\nNicer weather and or a better job opportunities center that are offered here so yeah we're shrinking area that doesn't mean we're a bad area but sometimes I think when they do that stuff about I Want to know what they're talking about the region\nThere's a big difference between the cities of Youngstown and Warren versus boardman Poland Canfield Austin down in those places is a huge huge difference uh agree\nWith that but still what I'm what I'm looking at is\nIf the jobs were here in the income was here we would attract younger people we have a great university here the problem is when people graduate they leave there is nothing in here to keep them and I I think people you know I I agree with you I Love this theory I don't mind the changing of the season\nWhere I Do mine is like you said the aging population of the people leading to reduce tax revenue and we've just constantly voted for the same people\nWho are well let me put it this way I I mean there's a there's a lot to overcome in and just take a look at it I mean political corruption\nAnd I know what it is a a big problem in Cleveland and it's probably everywhere but we're somewhat known for our political corruption and just one I think\nThat we're out of the woods you have these indictments with both sandwich and a Sam around in Youngstown comes rearing its head back with the old one hand washes the other and the bribes and all this kind of stuff\nIn and just tarnished as the area it just because I don't think business or people want to come to an area where they feel that they just got to pay people a bunch of bribes uh so I think that becomes a debt there's things that still haunt us you know strong union mentality this whole idea of corruption\nA haunts us and to a lot of it's when I talked to people who recruit people like physicians and that to come here believe me when I tell you it's a very difficult thing to to do a lot of when\nYou're trying to recruit specialists are doctors to come here it's a tough sell\nBecause they would rather go where there's more stuff to do in a more prosperous city and that kinda stuff so we have our drawbacks are pluses and minuses ... ah right I mean\nBut I Would say well that's worth it\nBut I use as an example of police loving in Jackson township I wouldn't want a hundred percent vote for that if I Lived in Jackson township because you have a police department that has one full time or in a part timer on duty\nAnd I wouldn't want to keep that I Would absolutely and it's such a small village is one male one and a half million or something like that well I wouldn't want a hundred percent vote for that you know why 'cause it's worth it\nBecause it's obviously efficiently run you have you know very ... you have you you want to you want somebody to be there\nSo that's why I say you know you got to look at what's your middle ages and areas and what you can afford\nSo there are things that I support that I Would say well that's good you know I'm a I'm In Austin Town with the school it has and adding new money I think for over Twenty years I think that's incredible and I would like to see that continue and I give credit to the school board and a super and done it because they know they're not going to pass a levee\nSo I give him credit for that that you know the school system as and ask for any money for a long period of time and that's a good thing\nBecause I don't think there's any more for them to get\n\nYou know I'm a angered at my own trustees because they just dropped the damn ball when the casino was supposed to pay half a million dollars a year forever for the entire time it was open but they so screwed up that agreement\nThat the casino got out of it that's solely\nRice with

three three zero seven to six thirty one hundred today [noise]\nLoyal welcome to Thursday Afternoon it's four thirty five out news radio five Seventy ... and\nSo here is a part of what's going on here today when you asked yourself oh what a is going to happen at the border or what's Trump going to do well the answer is she's gonna sends a eight hundred more troops to the Mexican border\nA federal law prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S unless specifically authorized by Congress tropic tweeted Monday that he alerted border patrol in the military that a caravan was a national emergency\nAh but the Pentagon said they had received any new orders to provide troops for border security but Trump told a rally in Wisconsin Wednesday that moves or under way way do you see what happens over the next couple of days you're going to see a very secure border you just watch in the military is ready they're all set a so a\nTrump earlier in the year or to the deployment of National Guard members to the U.S Mexico border to respond to a spike in illegal border crossings but those numbers remain under the control of the governors of the state where they're positioned in their activities are limited to support roles such as providing surveillance\nSo ah when when you say what is Trump going to do one or two\nAnd the ... to the border what he's going to do is send the eight hundred more troops down there certainly would be a deterrent or to say the least so there is an eight hundred more troops to the border at the direction of the president's sue declared illegal immigration and national emergency\nAnd so that's what's gonna happen they're so strong presence on the border that's that's number one comments about that\nAnd I and they say that some people are falling out of this or a group that was over seven thousand maybe because that news is\nGetting back to them as well when they come to the border that they're going to be met with resistance and they're just not going to come in here so maybe that news is starting to get back to them as far as that is concerned so that's one of the things that we are talking about here today\nObviously we're talking about so many people are just talking about so local money issues says well some good some bad you know and as far as that goes everybody has a right to their opinion and to to their votes are on that are as well here this afternoon\nAnd then we all live with the outcome right we own trying to make the best of news radio five Seventy nobody can be an Jerry on a cell phone you're on ear hello\nHi Don oh I Love it when you do that Hi Gerry how're ya good thank you for calling\nWell thank you for taking my call I just want to let you know I figure out a way to address the eight percent of your sewage increase that are going to be hitting us all here pretty quick\nYeah that so it's forty percent off for five years and people say well if you look at it it's actually going to be close to forty five percent and uh I I meant to get my water a lot I Know the sewage rate on it now is ridiculous but I'm going to just reiterate jury remember\nI Can't remember folks intervening pan and Guerra when he was mayor of Youngstown and he was talking about ... pm mandates and that's why we had to raise all your water and sewage sewage back then was to fix the system\nWell guess what now they're saying well because the EPA mandates we need to raise some forty percent over five years\nTo fix the system and then I look around and say well wait a minute how does fixing the system have anything to do with giving the mayor of new SUV to drive around and they had is fixing the system have anything to do with all this money that we siphon off of it for economic development in Youngstown what\nWe've been doing with all this money over the years why ever even better fixing a system why is it all up and gone to that why is the answer always you've got to pay more substantially more incidentally\nUh Lauren McNally one of the council people was the first to say people ... sewage bill will be in the hundreds and she's right I mean you know this is out of control\nYeah based on your ah we should have a state of the art everything but like you said it's my it's just been you\nKnow wasted away and fuse for other purposes I mean if it's the same amount of money that we all pay into the system and oftentimes as you pointed out we also hear forty percent surcharge on top\nFor your water yet if you're in the suburbs you're already paying forty percent more from for your water on on top of that now everybody's got to have water and you've gotta have sewage\nBut it's it's become the new ... I mean that this should have all been fixed over the going back to the euro for years I mean all cronies eh all cronies are putting the water department 'cause that's where all the money sent justice assignment\nAbsolutely that's how we get cars for the air and everything but right anyway I have actually disconnected water and sewer from my house so I'm going to be ... well\nWell to a certain extent I get what you're saying but on the other hand there I got I got two schools of thought on that um [noise]\nYou know a number number one is I have\nNever ever in my life seen president treated like this guy is being treated basically other than Fox News\nNot really getting a fair shake on any of these networks I mean there's a lot of good things happening in America and again\nAnd I think he uh he's\nThick skinned actually anymore because he puts up with all of that any fights back on Twitter I don't you know I'm troubled by like the Hillary Clinton's that say well we basically we don't have to be civil till we get power back\nI'm troubled by the Maxine Waters that say you know can get nice people face faces I'm troubled by the mob mentality I'm troubled by the extremist and the Democratic party that talk the way they talk\nI don't think that's the answer I think in America you got a right to your political opinion\nAnd I don't think people should be advocating\nViolence like like Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton I don't think there's anything good about that on any side of it on any side whatsoever I just don't I don't go for it I I was and I think Trump's so far has been the best president in my lifetime I Am thoroughly refreshed\nAnd\nNot know what [laughter] and and what\nNot and I think he makes people felt great when you tell them I think I think well\nAlmost think he has to be defensive because he's under constant attack you know think about it if you could see what a whack\nJob is a a a lawyer was that came out with this woman against a Cavanaugh\nI mean and the you know the whole ... every week it's been something to try to stop Trump you know this Russia investigation which has been going on for years and produced absolutely nothing\nUh to remember the ... what we could start with NBC tried to change election by saying hey let's listen to the locker room talk him and Billy Bush engaged and\nThen we can go to the Russian investigation and then we can go to a Stormy Daniels you know it's always something week after week where it's like oh we finally got him now\nAnd a lot of people are just saying enough of this already and Maxine Waters impeach him we don't care what the what it's for\nA look on on on mine and put a lot of\nHumor\nBut let me put it this way I mean he just right\nRight right right but let me put it this way I agree with Dave Dave is with my kind of ... I have on who said\nI Would rather have a guy gets in the face of these world leaders that NATO and says you're not paying your two percent of GDP and we're tired of you stick in us with the bill of this\nSituation and they come out and and they don't like him because he got in their face and said but they're paying their two percent now as opposed to not paying her two percent and they come out and say boy this is a great guy so some of what he's doing people don't like because he's actually doing something\nI mean you say your room or Canada was pissed out of Mexico was pissed Adam well guess what when the dust settled\nHe got rid of NAFTA renamed it and got a fair deal for America he didn't care if they were pissed at I'm just like right now he doesn't care if China's Pakistan him\nHe says are the Chinese are marketplace more than we need them and he's right about that in China's going to be going to be really pissed off a pistol had him for a long period of time but he doesn't care he's going to fix this injustice\nWith a nod respecting are patents dumping the\nWay people didn't get my meaning there\nEither I Love watching his route so [laughter] I don't I\nDon't get that I really don't get that but my eyes have been open the open my eyes I mean I I really can see the the huge liberal media out there that just bash them constantly and uh\nI don't I look at the guy and I just look at a record of accomplishment up take him with his flaws because he's getting stuff done that I think is the right direction they thank you my dear I don't buy news radio five Seventy ...

we don't charge you a dime seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven three three zero seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven Pam go ahead with your question hello there\nHi Hi I'm On my car and have it with a small claims court and a regular person like me take a corporation like my mortgage company and\nYou can provided that what you're seeking doesn't exceed the the three that outer yeah three thousand dollars\nGo hang out a single parent what you want to take your mortgage company to court for\nUm well I I've had more market company for a long time I and they let it they're handling\nYou know another corporation which is like one of the\nArt and they got rid of that because I sure they have had so many fights they were just sick of\n'em they added a two hundred and Seventy eight and on and it's all charges on my mortgage went I never paid it as you say well give me a reason\nFor it and um I've written a letter only of\nEverything and they're always\n... most was you know I'm an anticipated Moses answer directly or are you ready for that yes I ... this is how well I uh I I what I've learned from Carlos says maybe you need to call the attorney general's office\nAnd about a [laughter] wow you know\nJust you don't want to pay them just what I'm starting to set up in a chair here to try to look impressive to Carl Moses which had been striving to do for years you shoot me down like I've\nBeen teaching him [laughter] and then re runs it wasn't didn't\nI didn't call the attorney but there's a website that you can get I take your complaint and there and they get back to you and what they basically said oh well we can't do anything about [laughter]\nWell ... you know you could bring a case by case acclaim and small courts\nSo long as you're not seeking more than three thousand dollars against a corporation however if you are incorporated you cannot represent yourself as a corporation\nAs a plaintiffs showdown in corporate you know that but that might have been here confusion you could sue corporation but if you are a corporation you cannot represent yourself in small court you also can't get any kind of punitive damages and in small court\nOr any damage is related to slander are liable or abusive process or the malicious prosecution but in breach of contract like that so long as they're under three thousand you could go ahead and do they do what are your damages them\nShe just says she says are charger Eighteen hundred and something dollars that she had she hasn't paid a no show that you\nDid with add on to myself I used to it\nSays that this would all charges and they put it came to a hundred and seven eight dollars on there\nWhat is it or when you call him you know five years ago ... years ago I call in\nAnd I got a operator number well for one\n... of these awful ... more and more one yet [laughter]\nAnd he said that oh we foreign voice in\nOn it made the mistake on everybody and we're going to take care of it without a month okay so five years later I'm Still complaining about it and they'll call you about it and I just want to change markets company but and I'll have to have\nPam Pam ahead I Know it doesn't make sense to me\nNo ... you're saying you don't know it they acknowledge at one point you didn't but they're not doing anything\nTo him that company Pam that company has not that company has not sued you has no so you don't have any real damage so so what I was getting you haven't lost\nOut of leave it on every single month they live\nIn okay here's my question for can she'd go to small claims court and sue them for Eighteen hundred and fifty nine dollars that they claim she owes when she claimed she doesn't know\nShe's not out of pocket and so she's not damaged should they didn't take the Eighteen hundred for she'd have to be able to to to put a dollar sign on her annoy meant she'd have to be able to but then again I said small claims you can't sue for punitive damage it's strictly out of pocket cost it's strictly so she can't go to small claims\nSheet not for what she's seeking no one else who literally for I don't know intentional infliction of emotional distress or something like that but once again what are your damages have you been prescribed medicine recently because you can't sleep\nAre you nervous are you seeing a psychiatrist has it affected your life so that you can't enjoy the quality of your life\nIf those things haven't happened to you because of this and you really don't have a cause of action let me ask you this spam do you\nCall and I want to pay off my mortgage you got to pay that amount to go with another then I got that right then you may have been it made me write any reason for putting it on\nAnd and do you continue to call him weekly or monthly on this issue\nI have sent letters every single month and now that it back now it was free markets always on the top of my bill but then they had lung cancer therapy okay now it's back to freedom more gets\nFree market you got rid of lung cancer therapy thing they're blaming them for that and that they added that on for a reason that I Need to find out\nThat I had investigated the time let me ask one of the market on earth everything in Iran slowdown slows out of the uh let me ask mark since I assume this is in Ohio's a correct Pam Ohio or I'm asking\nMark is er an agency a governmental agency that regulates this type of thing because it seems to me that would be well the attorney general you know already you know it seems to me the attorney general's office would have either as a main office or a sub office that would that would take care of this type of thing\nAnd maybe maybe you're on a press maybe you ought to press that issue even if they were used initially maybe you are on the go above that person or whoever and try to get somebody who will focus on this issue\nOr retain an attorney and to have them send a letter to address it and indicate the ear going this is a bad faith claim that this is would be amount to an Justin Richmond if you paid it that you're going to pursue your civil remedies including punitive damages if they're acting intentionally and maliciously and maybe you could get some action out of that\nAre you sure that you're always paid on time these aren't any late fees or anything like that\nNo no no so you can say what upsets me give you an explanation harkens\nFourth date or something like that but they don't know why they put them\nRight mile ask them to put that in writing she's got to continue to be aggressive right exact vigilant\n... yeah you I mean I you you got to be ... you got a call on this every week and talk to every operator you can talk to and say I'm just trying to get an answer to that\nTime in my life for that yeah the squeaky wheel gets the grease\nWhat you need to make the time you need to stop you know ah for it and with all these guys and going out on the town and you need to stay at home and make these calls ma'am\n[laughter] okay [laughter] that's a good luck Pam thing a\nBoy that's a uh see I I understand her frustration due to an end and it gets you really upset because you're dealing with the people that obviously don't take their job seriously they can't answer\nThere some probably just some company that says well we don't know why you owe it and she knew she just needs to go to the next level if the you know she needs to see them if you don't know why oh who who could I talked to that does no\nI agree I keep going up the ladder until you get someone that could affect you

I I check this out I\nI'm not a Social Security lawyer but um to if you're eligible for Social Security benefits you cannot engage in what's known as substantial substantial gainful activity\nA vast G. A. for two thousand Eighteen you could work and collect your disability benefits as long as your earnings don't exceed one thousand one hundred and eighty dollars per month\nOr one thousand nine hundred and Seventy dollars if you're blind okay so um and that was just a quick Google but I wouldn't trust it I Would check it out don't take any advice that you just hear on the radio show\nOr a guy I agree with you hear what you ought to do is sit down with a lawyer who handles and focuses on disability\n... over in uh for that guy that called in all seriousness he should probably call and ask that question to lose ... or ... and Joe shavonnia over there in Austin tough they specialize in Social Security disability\nYeah I mean you and and everything I'm I'm looking for here is says you can do it but you can't work over a certain amount of time and earned over a certain amount of dollars here\nHere's what I'm concerned about is if he's on Social Security disability for whatever the issue is and he's and he's getting benefits as a result so he's been on it for a while he feels he can go back to work that might open the whole investigation into whether he belongs on disability at all and he could really screw him self lonely out of his benefits and everything well that's why I say to the call a lawyer you can\nCall anonymously first even before he sees them more just to get educated and then sit down with a lawyer because ... because there could be more details that he's not getting when he calls so\nYeah but I think I'd start with the work has sued because that's below the ants\nI'm just selling it so he has a better understanding before he sees the lawyer yeah that he'll be able to absorb\nAnd that's coming from car Moses your Social Security card is one right isn't that your number\n[laughter]\nI used to do Social Security disability or a long time ago I haven't done it in quite\nA while you know it's very difficult to get on it now because so many people are on it in a systems it's it's extremely difficult in most cases you're\nDenied and can be denied again fell and then you have to get go to a hearing in it that can take forever to get that\nThat's over everyone knows they deny you the ...\nBut a lot of time so that I at the same if you got to get an actual hearing you had been there so backlog it can be years before you\nGet an avalanche valuable they are back well yeah that's unbelievable I went to one of those hearings back in the day for your ... I I I was going to do some Social Security live figured I'd learned the hard way just go in a way that maybe it was on the other way herring and doing it you know [laughter] I think we did okay that I don't remember correctly\nYeah I've I've been to I've been to plenty of them in the past and there'll be for what's called the administrative law judge yeah yeah who who writes a circuit he goes from place to place and it was in a certain area of the country\nBut he used to say it was very easy to get not it's not so much anymore you know what I find interesting about Social Security disability and how much money you can get and the benefits that you can get from from it\nI've always heard this argument nobody's they're representing the government I mean you have a judge sitting there in years representing the client people make the argument somebody should be they're representing the government because it costs so much money or a ... they say no\nExcept there can be an expert for the government there\nYeah there should be allowed to be an expert for the government [noise] All right here is Chris with a legal question with Carl Moses dedicated to our legal show and he's here whenever we need them and if there's no fundraiser an attorney mark ...\nI'm Still stuck on four thousand dollars was an\nInsult yeah very expensive the manatee five it's got very expensive [noise] see I I that's why I worry about him losing everything but anyway go ahead with your question\nYeah this is a complicated but I'm going to simplify it as much as possible question is is there a case so I just a couple of quick questions you guys like owning or troubled county there yeah OK well does my owning county as a quarter or\nWestern Reserve Port Authority yeah OK\nOkay is there a barrel yes okay I'm going to\nUse them as an example they're not the county but let's just say that one at work or the authority on the west are is our orders starting your part time employee there you work for the director\nOf the Florida okay\nWhose name as Mr T.\nLet's call him Joe ...\nJoe Baca donuts are even\n... Port Authority and I'm the second in command\nYeah okay so then there's another gentleman was just calling us for a sea mister here's the director of the visitors bureau yeah\nYour boss the director of the Port Authority goes over to the director of the visitors bureau which you you should have some dealings with\nDon't show the point is that the director of the Port Authority goes to the director of the visitors girl and says hey listen I Need you to lie\nAbout my employee so I can go to the board of directors and get her fire and that man says oh don't worry about her and she saw this out why would I say that well and that person is\nSo then after a director of the Port Authority leaves the visitors bureau the director of the visitors girl the\nPerson was he must be asked to lie about says hey are you there yeah I talk to you out in the parking lot I'll meet you their jobs and Austin oh ... [laughter] you know why does he watch it gets you fire\nIs there a case their own way shape or form or do you need more information\nWell ... what did you say your boss you you stop for a minute there was some yeah I Do know silence your boss says he's still with the the Port Authority yes\nYes she still the acting director\nAnd and they and the guy that's the head of the visitors bureau went out and told the person that he wanted to fire have they\nWanted me to lie to get you know I guess you could file a grievance\nUsing any union representation\nNone any written contract\nWell how'd you find out they were serving you papers\nThey called me from Texas [laughter] okay\n[noise]\nYeah like they could have sold that dead or something I I don't you know I get to pay the papers and then bring them to someone and talk it over and I'm sure that this matter could be cleared up I'm sure they just want to be made hold and get the money that they used to to make good your check\nIn the meantime what I Would recommend is do you own a sledgehammer to\nGo out and started getting used to smashing big rocks and the little ones 'cause you could\nBe [laughter] if you come up with them [laughter] good alive\nAnd just started and learned the lyrics stole man seems like a nice guy I mean you know you you say you over draw but ... says\nDon't let these things go because they can become a dangerous that often so sometimes it's just easier to pay things off before they get to this level\nOf our he said he was going to pay you went to pay it off and they still don't solve our hands that's the real shame of it I mean if there's an issue I mean every time I've known someone that's over drawn to check that it's brought to their attention immediately\nYou know what really gets me though it's like you take the one woman she's just trying to find out whether our first caller why she owes Eighteen hundred dollars I Know and until somebody explains her voice are generating and she just needs to keep going up the food chain why was this added this is a mistake and she's just got to continue to find somebody that can say yes or no and this guy\nNew video thirty dollars ignored it and went up Fifteen dollars a day now it's up to eight hundred dollars he's not paying if they'd probably sold the debt I bet like you said right and they're gonna they claim they're going to so yep\nAnd you're saying guess what see if we get the papers now at this point right right and then they go ...\nI mean depending on what his headquarters is I mean bankruptcy could be an option on that you know depending on eight hundred bucks no I'm not saying it feels a lot of he was saying he had health problems a lot of money that maybe there's a situation where\nIf he goes to court and represents himself who knows how that can be oh can I say listen I only thirty bucks as out of work you know maybe they'll show sympathy you know probably not probably not the court wouldn't ... I don't think so I don't think so if you ... you owe it if they built it but a group is such a ridiculous amount\nIt grew to a ridiculous amount of agree but it depending on what kind of noticed this guy had what efforts he made to remedy the situation if he just buried he's had the sand and they kept growing and growing he might not get any sympathy\nRight and he does oh it yeah he does it All right I think\nIt's unconscionable to keep pounding on charges on top of it you know that that's\nThat's not fair but if you would have paid into would've never happened true I mean the thirty bucks Barbier on ear with attorney would just marked a vacuum just more after the fact\nThat Barbara yeah go ahead\nYeah I have a question about security right now I mean you got here to talk and in that I've been trying to get I'm a I'm not there for ... stuff I Want to get my um [noise] ah ah you know shoot\nDriver's license oh no I don't want to go to Israel a passport yeah passport and and I I I my my problem and\nAnd I had three first name is okay and I married twice so and my problem they're fed I don't have anything left my first\nMy maiden name on my three first name and the only shares chats and Jay which my name is Jessica Alan ...\nI thought it was only be a new job I was thinking of ways that would have the right [laughter] well that's\nNothing I'm just All right so so you you you you go down to the records department where moaning county I wrote certificate\nUm I I was born in Canada New Jersey\nAll right well you got to go to ... get a check facts and they won't give it to you because\nThey don't know who you are right\nBecause I don't have anything left my last name I my maiden name okay right and I get my punishment and they can make it I Would have my last name on it\nRight now both people given some weird problems and yeah\nI it it's been a ...

I mean you could give it a try I don't know what the if you fill out all the\nThe documents that are required to get a birth certificate provide them everything you need are they saying they want to see some form of id in your may name yeah\nTo prove it was I right\nTo such you don't have any but she's right if she goes to Social Security and say hey how can I get a copy of my original Social Security card for the Fort she's doing that is what she wants to do that yeah that's what I Would do\nWhen I worked at for tax\nMhm well just go down to Social Security office and ask them here in Pennsylvania yeah why not tell them what Jersey where I work\nWell yeah but Social Security's federally so it's all tied together go down and see what they can do to help you start there then call us back\nTheir blood sugar levels are good their hormones or write to science and started to come out and they're hydrated guess what they're able to go forward and that's what our patients tell me on a day to day basis is is the first time that I was able to stick with something and this is really a lifestyle that you're talking about correct eight is absolutely\nRight so so your program is so different from other weight loss programs first of all it's\nIndividualized writes it is everybody's in a different situation around we have people that come and sometimes they just need ten Fifteen twenty pounds of weight all the way up the people that are super obese that or you know well over a hundred and ... are considering Barry ... surgery or considering even lap band surgery so yeah we're able to individualize that for that individual\nRights and I know that you have doctors nurses priests judges all kinds of local celebrities that are done your program Iran with man gene over there in Pittsburgh you got a lot of people that are big\nBelievers we do you know I've been blessed Ron I've been doing this now for almost Eighteen years I've had over twelve thousand individuals that I'd been I'm going to help you know some very prominent people in the community members very black and gold teams in Pittsburgh and a local judges\nPriest but I'll tell you I and as much as I enjoy helping those people are on you know people in the media business I Do a lot of media work radio and TV [noise] you know I Love help and just that individual that stay at home mom that retired individual that housewife that gentleman and says you know what I'm working fifty hours a week and you know I don't have time to do things that I Need to do I get just as much satisfaction\nIt's helping that individual at home and say you know what this is going to work for you and your life is going to be better doctor factor talked about skeptical list are out there that's saying it sounds too good to be true I don't believe a talk to that let's say that I met and you know motivates them you know all the you know run that's my favorite question because I tell everybody is I'm a skeptic by nature okay\nBelieve me when I get involved in weight loss I researched the heck out of this I mean\nYou and I just met today but I mean I fly on airplanes all over the United states I travel with the best doctors in the world am I spent a tremendous amount of time trying to tell people is I've spent more money you know on my post graduate education and Eighteen years and I spent going through school getting my doctorate\nAnd here's what I Know this okay when something size too good to be true a lot of times it is\nBut what we know about weight loss as everything that we've been hot most of the information is wrong I'm telling you this the majority of its wrong that they're so I speak to that skeptic at the first thing and I said I'm as listening I felt over twelve thousand individuals if you come in and you sit down with me and I feel that I can help you I feel that you're going to be compliant\nI think it's a good fit I'm going to put an unconditional guarantee on the program and very few people anywhere in the country Iran do this we bought a twenty pound unconditional guarantee\nOn our program the first six weeks but what I said that person right now is never give up hope you know take the time to look at this if somebody comes into her office right and I really pride myself on is that we don't give anybody pressure our job is to lift him up a level I'm not to make them feel bad about their weight\nTo lift them up but if somebody comes in and says you know what it's not for me I'm not ready to start right now that's okay but what I went to an individual do as a least take a look at this and say you know what if I'm overweight right now\nEvery facet of my life's affected and think about the potential what would it be worth twenty thirty forty fifty pounds of weight to lose it\nAnd be able to keep it off guinea that opportunity because I'll tell you what a skeptic is right now so many that just needs run a little bit more information and one of the benefits when that person starts taking that weight off the last eight ... physical there was a mental and there was emotional and physical benefits decreased risk of heart attacks okay\nTied to the cruises type two diabetes blood pressure going down arthritis getting better mobility issues\nSelf esteem you know I have a young lady we're gonna be doing a Facebook Live within the next couple of days her name is Vicky over a hundred pounds of weight she says and I am a whole new person okay a whole new parts and she says everything has changed her demeanor physically mentally emotionally\nBecause she was able to get that laid off is it harder for the person to lose a hundred pounds of weight or ten or twelve or Fifteen pounds well let me explain okay everybody's individual is different heavier the patient I always say to the good news is way it's going to come off quicker okay\nHowever there are people that only need to lose ten or Fifteen pies are going to take weight off a little bit slower so\nI think it really depends upon the individual\nYou know we're the rabbit again we're able to customize that approach to help that individual that only need to his little or a lot what can the average patient Dr factor expect\nTo lose in the first six weeks the average our average Beijing right now in our office and we've charted this that's why we have a twenty pound unconditional guarantee our average patient is taking twenty pounds all laid off in the first second or six weeks I Want to back up and say that's OK are heavier individually we're talking about\nOne of the morning show hosts over I hurt median Pittsburgh okay\nJust sat down with me Nineteen pounds and Twenty one days this is what he said to me he said when I first ... news thing would work because I met media partners and met other on our talented on your program he said but I had no idea\nThat it would work the way dead now heavier patients Ron certainly can take off more weight and lighter patients take off less you know I just had a lady last week became in\nHer goals to lose twenty pounds of weight and I said are listening we're going to get you down about Fifteen\nAnd the first six weeks to she's a little bit lighter so the heavy you are obviously the fashionable way it's going to come on now your office is located where we're located in ... township seven sealed we're about forty five minutes or onto an hour from where we're at right here to station I'll tell you what I have a tremendous amount of people because of the media work that I Do\nYou know goes in Ohio West Virginia where people right here\nThey've done the program the nice thing is okay\nIs your only come in for the first that you're going to come in we're into everything on that first visit if we feel that we can help you were going to get just started and then the nice thing is we everything remotely okay we do that or do what we are coaching remotely via telephone an email and if we have to

them way theirself a home and keep track of that for us to show that they can't use the excuse\nWell I don't want to go over to cranberry every week or every two weeks in other words you're saying
