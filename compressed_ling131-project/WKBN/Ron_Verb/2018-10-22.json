there is some some one and money's got to be behind this marching these people towards the United states and they don't want anything but to get to the United states\nAnd the timing is interesting the amount of people continues to grow a it's all interesting to me but I Want to tell you these people to see a lot of men I I'm totally and completely opposed to that\nI happen to agree with the presidents who in essence a you know made a pretty strong statement as he says and I agree this is a national emergency you of seven thousand people\nWho are marching for the border of this country who are going to demand to be led into this country and then they will be lost in the country forever you'll never find him\nYour comments seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety

should just let him in or we're a country of immigrants but you know I happen to agree with the terms is isn't it an invasion of my country left\nDiabolical and I wouldn't put it past them do that because they figured Trump would send in the military now the first time on on those\nChildren are one of those women is believing they're going to splash all over CNN and MSNBC and are going to

outlawed if you're not going to honor banner laws than the constitution is irrelevant even though that's where I think\nThe Democrats Iraq [noise] right I mean why bother\nI mean no mistakes that you've got a Democratic Party that doesn't believe in ice doesn't believe in borders thinks illegal should be able to vote you got a wacky Democratic Party the views I think these people as future voters\nAnd you have people ... that sounds so insensitive that say hey guess what this is gonna mean more people go into the hospitals are not paying more people on the relief rolls it's gonna be ... and ...\nThat's a good point there around because what what\nTrump's you do see is like to get on a tweet he should say you know what these ... these people come in the corner like the Democrats want\nAre going to charge their medical they're gonna they're gonna charge to their ah everything\nYour going to be paying for these people and how long you don't want to pay for these\nPeople I mean you know I I go to a certain extent I make it make no mistake I think this is organized somehow in somebody's paying for it and the timing certainly suspicious but I think this kind of stuff to do my fellow Americans believe we should just let these people come into the country and we should just start taking care of everybody and paying for everybody\nAnd forget coming into the country legally\nI

they can they can do that\nBecause you don't know is from Ariel like from a journal ever exactly where if people are going to show up and do that that's why a really an idea how to slow things down and all that they won't be able to get through that are out there\nWell do you honestly I think that you have a segment of our society a segment of liberal minded people who just think oh we should let everybody come into the country but that there should be borders or shouldn't be ice well\nIt's the Democrats or shouldn't be ice or shouldn't be borders illegal should be able to vote hey it's good for our party though ... it all this kind of stuff you have a lot of people with that mentality\nYou and I sound like we're we have the opposite it is an invasion there's a legal way to come here you're just not going to force your way into this country and I and uh I I'm with you whether that's barb wire whether that's whatever you got to do something\nTo stop this from no matter what he does the cameras will be there and there will be people who say they say it's horrific that he's doing this for the families to families we can't believe that it's just let them all in ...\nWell I think ... people pretty much our head and I have a lot leveling out with the Democrats there and it's pretty obvious ... they're\nWhat they're trying to pull him it doesn't matter child has a legal right to protect our borders in fact that it may job than during the attack the country and as long as they want the legal right\nYou can go for it and of course we know there is a concern that there might be violence or they might hacker but I'm Sam my idea was that maybe like that would ward off of\nIt but I Want I Want you to remember because you know the the people in and out and said\nTo all of these feel good people about separating families uh-huh when they said the reason we do that is to make it a deterrent\nTo not encourage people others from coming here thinking if they bring their kids they'll get another country quicker because the answer is they do they hold him twenty days\nThey ... they take pictures they give a court date they go into the United states and get lost and you never see them again\nLet's start with that so so that's why they would separate to families and now now with the feel good everybody saying how horrible it is I guess what has happened is encouraged people to bring their kids and come to the country it has done exactly what people have Warren nice feel good people about how horrible we are\nChaos and I and I support the president is right now yeah go ahead I mean I'm really troubled\nYeah they're very famous guy who said that Americans would have gotten the job done but they generally wait till the very last time and this is the last ...\nMom and like we really haven't met any faster but decades if not those are half a century so now that the people are finding these ... that okay and renting any longer\nWould lead your neck disasters\nI think American people have joined ... and those who think that they can get away with it and that's kind of ...\nSaddam Hussein ... that that these people would have a hard time taking me down and read the can down but then they're ... so I think this is something when American people and make their mind that they take a long time to make that in mind that but when they met their mind that\nThan the things get done and ... that kind of prefer to kind of who we sent for that's what that's\nAbout\nAll I certainly hope you're right but I but I'm afraid of a there is a mindset in America as people who believe in socialism people who don't believe in ice people who don't believe in borders people it does or we'll have a feel good mentality about this invasion\nUh\nLike I've never like I've never seen before I mean this is really\nYou saw what happened at two Mexican Guatemalan border what do you think's gonna happen when they get to this or do they want a showdown well how do how are you going to stop 'em 'cause you can't let them in the country 'cause once they get in you'll never find them again\nIn remember he now these are the same people who said you can't separate families and it only encourage more people to come and more will come if we don't separate them this time so we already had a bunch of the people in our country crying because we separated children from their parents including all these politicians\nAnd the and the power structure tried to say you're only going to encourage more to come and look what's happening\nI think that the math on that when they start to fix them back on ... ... ... feet for that you ever done that in game ... this is only ... or ...\nOn their own separate Andrew Jackson made a run or distraction because I could be that come through a curator routinely used when they if they don't care they won't ... your ... your character going anywhere at that age\nI think something of rape not an issue I think

prove them wrong well I don't know it's going to happen in full agreement that they should not come in yes it is an invasion\nI Believe this is the new form of warfare because in the same thing happened they've final and all the people from Africa\nWell look at the look of the nightmare they got in Germany in Europe in place but I Want\nThe global want chaos because then they can take over that divide and conquer\nThanks for your call news radio five Seventy to eighty ... eighty four Ford any\nHey Ron how're you doing there I don't want to get shots that more months are going to talk about a caravan yeah as I call it Sam South American mom and I want to talk about school levies\nYesterday I just put the TV on and it was probably on Fox and sometimes I just because CNN's right there I just looked at over and see how long I can say it but anyway they were interviewing one of these mobsters headed our way so pretty good English for you know what he said you said\nWe're coming to the United states to get our children in school to get jobs [laughter] so I just want the school boards to realize maybe they're better started getting some levees rich [laughter] they're they're getting some new students but they are going to have to pay your ordinary these ones are really\nLet's be realistic here I mean it would be a massive draw on all of a it'd be massive draw on hospitals doctors schools\nOr social services would be it would cost millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars now uh it's ... it's ridiculous it was I don't care I mean it sounds everyone should be\n[noise]\nFor show on news radio five Seventy W. K. be in it for thirty\n[noise]\nYes that's happening in the valley good afternoon I'm happy to have as President Trump's approval rating is about former President Obama's rating leading up to the first midterm election that's according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll it ... forty seven percent approval among registered voters\nPresident Obama stood at forty five percent about the same time in twenty can\nThat trial or the people charged in the murder of Shannon graves so now be heard next spring and buy a new judge\nToday was supposed to start ... trial you think he's just killing grade it disappeared almost two years ago but was found dismembered and in a freezer at a Campbell home a year ago\nA lottery ticket sales are reaching an all time high after nobody claimed the massive mega millions or power about jackpots over the weekend that Canada mind blowing to point two billion dollars combined the odds of purchasing the winning ticket one in three hundred million\nFor the powers that be like GMC at Calcutta, Ohio newsroom I'm Cathy David\nFrom America's Best selling automobile two worlds toughest trucks there's a reason why customers are driving from Youngstown boardman Austin down her message even Cleveland Pittsburgh so come and find out for yourself that are all new state of the art facility on route forty six see you at Toyota worn\nMake every occasion event or wedding special with chocolates hallmark cards and gifts from Austin Town Goran chocolate cheer box of chocolates gift baskets and candy arrangements as well as everyone's favorite chocolate covered strawberries make gift giving is simple is stopping at Austin Town going chocolate\nTearing the western pleasant as a quarter ... forty six and moaning avenue in Austin Town and remember whether it's a wedding special occasion or business in Austin Jones Lawrence chocolates you can handle it all on line and going to Austin sound dot com\nThe Home Depot we know communities are more than bricks and mortar\nAnd we're part of the community\nWhen it comes to sell boring little rain can be a big problem and\nNot with L.

I I'm more from the school of thought I Am from the ... school of thought somebody is funding is somebody is organizing is very much as political ramifications that they're hoping for their\n... there's no doubt in my mind and the timing of it and they think whoa we'll make Trump look bad because we'll get a ruckus going on down there like they did when he separated kids that'll be good for the Democrats\nI think it'll backfire because I Can't imagine people say just let people walk into it\nYeah but if you had like you know tear their organization backing it you know financially to me that would be it would work\nYou know with the drug lords down there and give them some money get these guys round up you know give them a couple a million bucks than them on their way they don't care they're going to America They're happy and that disrupt our border and allows all sorts of people to come across\nMhm you know I don't know that was my thought but uh\nBut uh I'm visit your time but that was my thought on that subject\nMost some and some I mean you're not for letting them into the country right I mean it wouldn't you wouldn't know I got to think the majority of people in this country would support the president saying they stop at the board and they are not lead into this country\nAnd we're going to send a military down and make sure that that happens because yes all why every morning I mean and I I just I I I got to believe that it's the the majority of people would support that if they don't then I don't understand them\nNo I agree with you a hundred percent I think it's completely insane and ah yeah it's a scary moment for America for sure\nThank you for your call Jane ... Senate boardman news radio by Seventy due to give you know\n... ... good sir\nYou know what a couple of things I'm for starters there's two ways to keep people in or out of your country\nYou know the number one you have to incentivize them from coming here and number two you have to incentivize them for staying where they're at so look at India more kids that the United states and get their engineering degrees return to India and that used to be the other way round they used to all day\nSo more returning because you know places like Mumbai and other countries you don't have their cities are growing and beginning this experience and prosperity\nSo I'm not sure going down with a show of force even though I Would love to do that\nI'm not sure going on with the show of force is going to solve much you know we have to figure out you know our laws have to be said that it is not advantageous to come here legally you're not going to get assistance you're not going to get help you're not going to make money you know\nIt set up the other way around so I think going down to the show of force you know I don't know maybe it does fix it I'm not saying I have an answer but I'm just saying that you know there has to be some changes to get those people to not want to come or to stay home you know once upon a time\nHundreds and thousands of Irish and Italian came they don't not any more why because it's not advantageous for them to come\nYou don't want to hear people talking about that that that was maybe the people who came here I came here legally they didn't invade the country from Italy\n[noise] ... yeah that's a great point to and then when they got here would they do they screen and they went to Ellis Island the screening for diseases blah blah blah you know it's you know they they didn't come here illegally\nBut at the same time it was ... you know get on a boat and go it's not like they stopped you from coming you know so it\n... the ... the floodgates open anyone could come that want it to ... but then there was at the screening process there was this you know ... you know for instance my last name was ... I may\nBut they forgot to write the tail in the end of the day with my great grandfather and his P. A. N. G. I. O. mhm so I'm sitting here you know in my everyday my last name to pronounce\nAs a result of what happened back that screening process it's a memory for me\nSo that it it does it it doesn't go just let everybody in now and I think they need to the laws have to be fit to be incentivized that and the problem is I'm I'm am I correct in saying that you were you know and historical you probably voted more democratic and Republican but of course that flip flopped\nOh dramatically in it as it is so dramatic\n... the Democratic party has changed dramatically over my lifetime I mean when you when you ask me that question I Can't support I ... I'm Sorry I think it is a mob mentality I don't care if they get offended by that I don't agree with what they did with Kavanaugh I don't agree with the disruption that they're doing as far as\nPeople that are out there I don't agree with a losing focus of their core supporters wearing them that\nThey're facing is you said you know the the best a social welfare program is a great job yes\nYou know I mean I you know at this point the game I have absolutely no respect for Democrats for the leftist for the leftist that they are none whatsoever mhm you know I mean I'm you know you get a caller earlier said you know buying ammunition or whatever or\nYou know at some point it's it's probably going to come down to that I mean they want\nThey want to fundamentally change this country\nAre you know there's a and you know to them I mean they want to be able to tell us how to lead our lives I mean Democrats if they I mean if they don't want to ban something they want to mandate it I mean they want to tell you how to live your life on\nA you know and you know I you know my point of view is screw you buddy absolutely screw you you know you know come get me off\nI mean it's a ... you got one thing right it's going to be a difficult situation to deal with\nI I mean ... we go back to the wall that is the most non\nLethal means of dealing with this problem that you had all these moron said no no no we can't do that it's a waste money whatever I Want to if we had we had a thirty foot wall with like that big pipe at the top that that even our seals weren't able to get over I mean\nKnow we wouldn't have this problem mhm ... the way the board of the way the border as there are ports of entry every forty one mouse or where if you have a legitimate you know we're a claim for asylum that you go they're not doing their they want to just get one foot on the ground and because they're from not\nFrom a joining country whether Canada or Mexico we when we got thrown off the law is actually

is a major problem I mean not everything is easy to solve when he gets what the last report seven thousand people it is very much a national emergency is Trump is said and very much is an invasion\nAnd they're very much is troubling but any group or any Americans would want something like this to happen for whatever political reasons or whatever motivation to do something like this to our great country\nI never thought I'd quote Savage but it is the enemy within some times that I think is what we need to be the most fearful for there is a legal way to come into this country in a process to come here and he's seven thousand plus people are not interested in that\nThey're interested in getting here getting into this country and then getting lost in the country and that'll be the end of it and ah\nI'm all for people coming here legally I'm all for people to come here and work when they get here and support themselves seems to me that that's\nThe way the way it is in a way it should be can we go back here now a yet no alright news radio five Seventy to eighty Korea and then run for ... pick it up I think after the new spray cure at five I Know you're on hold just stand by and stay there\nWill be with your momentarily a right after the news well of along segment there when we can take simply more of your calls in a one right after we got the right up until six o'clock this is an issue will continue to focus on\nBecause I think this is one of the most important issues you can talk about I don't know that there's a good solution but I Know that people that are calling they're saying well you know just open fire and that kind of stuff that isn't a possibility nor should it be nor should that to happen there's got to be a way to\nA a non lethal way to deal with this in ... to drive people back you know there are other methods to do that um they have these things have to create sounded force you to go back to that you know you you don't go further because it's so excruciatingly painful on your ears and what have you so\nThat might be a method that they have to use callers you're on hold your position is reserved and we'll take it in order after the [noise] the\nFive o'clock shot their brothers find heart Corey road can be used radio five seven\nWCBS young south\nABC News\nI'm Scott Goldberg president from bass retired one of his political nicknames as he campaigns for a Republican senator\nI don't know what I don't know what to see what's gonna happen I can just tell you I I yeah I Do too I think you have to change first of all your laws that are about it so first of all I think you have to see all of all\nThe suckers that basically said oh you can't separate families you got to see what the experts were telling me is if you don't do that you will encourage more people to come because they'll get into the country\nAnd that's exactly what has happened so I think you do a number of things you you you got to go back to where you have to separate families you got to take a look at who's organizing is whose funding is a and then you're looking at\nThe Catholic Church and then you get and then you better take a serious look you got to stay with the laws are\nAnd then you got to have a I don't know I don't know if it's barb wire what it is to prevent people from actually getting to the border wall to wall yep\nThat's that's the only way China will\nTurn around it all home they don't have no Mexicans are\nYeah I mean it's a it's it's a it's a huge huge a confrontation and I think that's it and I think that's what they want I think they want a huge a violent confrontation\nHappen I don't know it's been happening\nMaybe not this thing but there's always going to be in that thing\nThat keeps growing I mean do do do seven or eight thousand people just think that they can just march right into the country and say to hell with everybody we don't care what year laws are we're here we're staying screw you\n'cause it'd be errors yeah seems to me the mentality fine thank you normally you bend go ahead\nRon I I'm I don't like the fuzzy left I certainly don't like I don't like the far right but I'm a tailor I'd been here for the last two hours is hatred you know it is a hatred fest shooting people\nWell that's just going to happen I Know loading up with old mhm I'm gay center you know I Am the right\nBut there's always going to be paranoid people and that kind of stuff they're not going to shoot anybody but what do you do norm\nBut what you do for so long as it's as far as I'm concerned it lowers the law there's no way around around you much enforce the law here's the way you get into the country if you don't qualify you don't\nGet in simple don't deal with the less says I don't care about anything else here is the\nDamn law generally are down there ... you don't fit the bill out\nI mean I hear your you know what you really need is a bunch of buses to say you get on these buses 'cause we're taking your back that way so far and you're going back to where you came from I mean that's really what you mean\nIt's not a bad idea but the point simply use force law\n... it sounds simple yeah but I mean how many ... I don't get me free loading a liberals go crazy over that\nI don't know how you're right I don't know that they're going to listen to that I mean\nThey they are from everything I've read nor may want to they want to get into the country put foot do put on the ground then they get process and they get released with a court date then you never see him again and they're in the country yeah ... and the job disappear or they go do something but they just disappear into the country you got to prevent that from happening\nOh I agree with you that's why I'm saying is the law enforced will all my mother and dad\nKeep the old ... old country they came from a foreign country to go through citizenship and all that other than ... Ellis Island and know diseases that are actually should only still be right\n'cause aren't you know like I'm I'm concerned about all of these outbreaks that we're seeing and wondering if it is you got something to do with some of this going to be blunt with you because because the conditions in the immunizations don't exist\nIn the ... the difference is Ron what's that\nWas back in our days my meet my parents and all that there was a port of entry right you don't have this year because you have a board there all landlocked mhm I think that's what it is it no I ...

the most of the time I mean you know my question to him obviously would be well you supported Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump if Hillary Clinton would have got elected you would have TPP and none of this stuff would have happened as far as NAFTA's concern because she's a globalized do you acknowledge the fact that the tax cuts and cutting regulation\nI have been dramatically benefit of

exact opposite he has to temper great months August scream excuse me August great man when September great month now in the beginning of October a little iffy and then obviously\nPretty hard downturn here on the NASDAQ and the down the S. and P. this last past week but it was to be expected if this market will continue to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow without releasing a little bit of era to bloom you create a huge bubble and then it would blow up like an eighty seven market crash\nSo what happened is that what has to happen for the swing sharp click come into effect does this thing has to pull back and then create what's called a boy scout uphold so pulled back pulled back goes back to ... to ... and then it when it launches it goes even further than what it was back in August ... which were my eyes\nSo that's what I Believe the data doesn't support anything catastrophic\nLike people are thinking that's going to happen it's all media related I have the same exact conversation with folks and on the show and so February and I call it like a like a way to start you know this is what's going to happen is what I Believe\nAnd and sure enough it did and then I'm not saying again that I'm guaranteeing it's got to be right but it sure looks identical to what we had in February\nSo ... so [noise] so\nI get it through my head why is the market going down and so it's it\nIs everything in a market based on greed and fear every single thing is based on greed and fear\nAnd and when you ... so what happened is the media got a hold of interest rate increases Trump kind of I don't know stepped on his own for a little bit by blaming the fed for going crazy which in which even added more gasoline to the fire\nAnd then kind of obviously somebody in their their their stance and and something an hour she went to Don and just basically media media flashing the risk lights media flashing the gauges oh ... ... when it becomes such so its own self fulfilling prophecy\nAnd then it goes down and everybody and then somebody across the street just oh man it's going down and the other guy slowly going down and better so off and you have an over inflated sell off for no reason well nothing fundamentally behind\nAnd and that's what happened here so basically uh to sum up for your on your question is a good one this because you want a heart heart fact of what's causing it the answer is there's no hard facts there's there's there's just just only fear driving that market down which I think it's temporary\nAnd like when I was down six hundred points the the you know looking back what last week\nAnd I'm just looking at eighty nine actually like eighty three\nThe end of the day on the go\nInto your investors calling you or are they concerned and yeah yeah I'm Sorry I cut you off guard now I see a lot of 'em don't because they figure you got it under control so what are you what is your strategy are you buying into the market more I mean what are you doing right now\nWell new investors money we are I'm waiting a little bit I think we have about a week week and a half\nTo maybe even ten you know ten trading days before the stabilizes so we're waiting on new money majority of my money's been invested\nNow ... I don't remember his last time we had our cash positions that the one or two percent I'm so honestly we're not really injecting more money 'cause we've already been fully invested let me tell you what I'm not doing I'm not jumping ship 'em for only a hundred percent engaged in the market a hundred percent believe that we have more to go\nAnd I pulled back for health healthy and I told her about kind of you know if you're looking for me the day trading staying or get out because CNBC or Bloomberg uh you know put it in a bunch of BS data to to run of the fear gauge it said I'm not I'm not your guy\nYou need to fire me because I'm never going to do that and and I said well William I'm ... I'm not going to work for a Jerry Jones and\nMay so you know I said what does that mean is it 'cause I haven't country before all the um I'm right in the you might on the Philippine but I'm learning a place\nAnd the planes are going to run I Believe we're going to win Super Bowls so on and so far one so I I told him if if the score was if there was a football score\nJohn Arnold verse media hype John on the would be upsetting as you are right now because every time the Steven media hype goes goes into effect and oh Armageddon in here and the the wall falling apart and Chicken Little stuff\nAnd I go and say people calm down\nA this is a temporary slide back in the market easy easy easy\nAnd sure enough I'm not going to have later and says if we never even had the conversation on right so again if you're looking objectively John Arnold versus media hype market a downturn it's John on the football and ask kicking media hype getting it so\nThat's that and um and and and and and I had that frustrated uh from from conversation with our clients because I care\nRight but but you don't see any thing that alarm she was far as a corporate earnings I mean you don't see any\nHelp is it right I I I mean I ... I I Want to make sure it's driven by media see her as you say it has nothing to do with interest rates creeping up nothing to do with terrorists\nNothing to do with consumer demand or or any of this kind of stuff correct\nNon zero zilch and I and I use I mean listen\nAll kidding aside you and your wife go out you go to the uh the fireplace rushed rhyme you go to your the various things if you're you're you're a business owner has anything in your life been affected or by the tariffs at all no one wants that no\nNone right know incorrect clients same deal John on the same Vietnam listen I live in two economies I I I live in Jupiter, Florida half the year to live in a camp at Ohio you have to you're so it's not like I'm blinded because we live in a recessionary area\nI'm here to tell you nothing has changed in my life at either location nothing zero don't my clients same thing now I'm not saying a future that won't happen but the market doesn't work on so at the end of the day fundamentally speaking when you're talking about earnings per share or profit margins\nOr balance sheets or income statements or cash flows anything fundamentally if you want to look at the true fundamentals\nIt it really says we're in a bull market for the rest of our lives I mean that's how good our mouths are now listen that's that's never going to happen because well markets come to a screeching halt but right now and that is a fundamentally they're great uh as far as other economic data are away from stocks\nGDP unemployment home building a orders\nNon non non farm payrolls ... ...

I'm more likely it will All right go ahead or\nI Want to read this to you and get your reaction natural gas prices jumped on a new eleven to Fifteen day forecast that shows below average temperatures across the U.S the cold weather comes at a time when natural gas shortage a storage levels\nAre at a decade low natural gas demand has been strong this month as consumers are running air conditioning and now turned on heaters with no in between whether\nNot a good scenario for the winter months\nNot well not a good Sanford and or if that's for sure um I I got to tell you that\nThat that does scare me it really does because you're going to see and obviously MCS go way up a lot of people getting hurt by that and if you're an investor that's good because the commodity industry is going to be\nYou know they're going to be pumping and they're going to be ready for the margins so um but overall economic Lee that could that could put a little Denton 'cause the equation but I I again I think that's all built into the market and I think you're going to be just fine 'cause you got to remember I'm going to say what half of the United states\nAnd it really doesn't turn on their heat in the minor you know what I mean so\nIf you're below the Mason Dixon Line in or if you're a coach the Wyoming area down to California it might get a little cold but it wasn't going to be like well we're at where it's minus twenty\nWith the wind chill so uh it it bounced itself out I think you're I think more than ... you're you're onto something there with a catastrophic or weather events which it does happen\nIt's gonna be it's ... there's no way to protect with how that's going to turn out I think that will turn out to be a plus for the economy and that obviously for the people who are receiving the bad but um it's hard to tell and I also think you're really on to something with these midterms but\nA lot of people including yours truly talking very scared of the terms of those turn those little turn out\nThe way they ... the way we want him to as far as pro business\nIt's gotta be some hurt and going on a promise that all\nRight let's take some calls for John Arnold's news radio five Seventy ... dancer boardman you're on which on Arnold\nI had a question um I was wondering what the oil price going up and the political uncertainty going on with Saudi Arabia where do you see like electric car industry like we have a lot and what type of impact are they going to have\nWith the other car companies that are locked into your ...\nThank you for your call go go ahead John\n... is that it was not the only ... only on the electric cars that will change in the first one Tesla away in touch with Iran burns money like a lot of money it's just it's too too volatile you don't know how it's going to react\nYou know you don't know how the CEOs ... if you'd only smoking dope on and on Twitter again ... ... it's just\nIt's too volatile stock so regardless of\nWhat ever happened to the Saudis and penalties we've put on sanctions or if we don't Tesla's definitely swimming I don't I don't think about all over all to the overall to the industry as well as a whole if you think this through that actually might help works out\nIt might give people buying more cars versus trucks and smaller she reads and and I ended up like actually a good thing or people want to buy the answers that so um I Hope I kind of journal answer that question\nAll right let's go next to David in Poland you're on what John Arnold news radio five Seventy do what he can be on holidays\nI I'm One who is your opinion on Canadian cannabis stocks as our Laura and cannot be a ... this this puts me in a pinch even if I even if I were allowed to give you an opinion on an individual stock on the radio\nI Would not on this particular stocks because I don't know enough about the marijuana industry and I don't know enough about ... than with them so I I Know I mean to put this way\nI Know a lot of people who have made a lot of money on their own Canadian marijuana stocks and a lot of people that have lost a lot of money on Canadian marijuana stocks\nI don't personally and got some things I don't know or don't understand grab a hundred percent bay a hundred percent objective data on the best way to the best way to summarize this is right now\nYou have a bunch of ... you're watching a NASCAR race and all the NASCAR like the exactly the same it comes down to some luck and it comes down to the driver on you know they all look the same ... just about the same horse power everybody's pit crews top march but they're starting with what I say a hundred cars all the same\nAnd trying to guess the winner of those is almost impossible because anything can happen so that's how I view the marijuana industry especially Canadian marijuana industry\nI don't have an opinion on that one 'cause I'm not legally allowed to get one regulatory wise but to even if I could I Can't help you out on this and I I sincerely from the bottom of the heart I'm Sorry I cannot do that\nNo problem thank you thank you\nThank you for your call news radio five Seventy two ... and we're talking with John Arnold you've
