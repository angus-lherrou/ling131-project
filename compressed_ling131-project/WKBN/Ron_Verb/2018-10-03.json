trade\nNAFTA and saw him and I are kindred spirits and the fact that it would upset both of us because it just seemed like our country was being sold out with no regard for American manufacturers with no regard for what it was doing to American labor almost\nIn the global is mentality so I Want to go back to [laughter] to those days ... Johnson\nIs on the in my line obvious suicide bill tile obviously ah Columbia county Republican Party chairman when we talk about trade NAFTA it didn't matter to you whether it was a Republican or Democrat\nIt didn't matter you were you were upset with how the country was going on is and how we were being represented correct\nYou Ron I'm back in that day when we were fighting NAFTA a Jim

industry in America\nMust ... domestic market\nTalk a little bit about how when these trade deals started Dave where your company was how many employees you had and what happened over this period of time that you that it was ignored by Democrats and Republicans\nWell I can tell you pre NAFTA\nWhen some of those tiles was at its peak and having been started in Nineteen twelve by my grandfather by by the Nineteen nineties Nineteen eighties some ago had a three time factories\nWe had this Eighteen distribution centers across the country we had to clay mines and cement plant cement making them orders in ... that that feed into ... installing tile seven hundred and fifty employees company wide\nUm post the NAFTA and post WTO and post all the host of trade agreements that that were enacted in by Republicans and Democrats they all signed onto them\nNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton mhm and but I blamed both parties but after that to this point in time\nI have about a hundred and forty employees and one child factory and I am fighting to save those jobs and it\nIt is a ... ... if you think you can compete with decent wages I I'd like to pay my employees double what I'm paying but it but the reality of it is the industry that we're in the pay healthcare to pay pension plans to pay five weeks paid vacation\nJury pay funeral pay perfect attendance pay\nDisability insurance if someone gets sick and and not related even to work and has to have time off we have coverage for him if you think my competitors in Mexico have that or in China I have visited there factories and then visited those companies and and they don't\nAnd that's why they've devoured and again I can only speak I'm very knowledgeable about the ceramic tile industry but\nIt's the same and all kinds of other

Democrats narrative\nRights so and so yes\nSo Trump gets in any still filling these promises incidentally when some people are saying Mr President the economy's going really well by cutting taxes and cutting regulations maybe you shouldn't do anything with these trade agreements or with terrorists because\nYou might screw it up and Trump said no he said I'm going to still do this because it's about fixing America and he's a lousy trade deals and he took his guy Peter Navarro\nAnd they they been renegotiating NAFTA deal and a with a lot of criticism people ad against Mexico and Canada in highly screwing things up\nBut lo and behold he reaches an agreement with Canada and Mexico that's their that's fair for everybody days right\nAnd they they blame him for not getting along with our

front of our factory ... number one about half of the people with today's young people can't pass a drug test so that that's a problem but nevertheless record unemployment or that we're seeing\nA on a ... a record employment you mean we're seeing but don't you also think that could open the door to allow more people to come into our country illegally I mean it was one of the arguments that he says we're going to build a wall but there's going to be a door in it because we are going to need some people that come in here\nAbsolutely I think will always be welcome to to having immigration but it's

a hundred and fifty of them at all those people that that they talk there were I think like ten or twelve or Fifteen that they were undocumented\nRight the rest of them had a right to be here and said

office says William Clyde Allen the third is now in custody\nEveryone that I Know that goes to south which everyone there isn't an exception to that goes there\nWere no matter what the procedure comes out and brags about the place so it's been successful in the standard that you've maintained over the years\nYeah I'm I'm proud of it I'm proud of that side of it I'm proud of the uh what we've delivered to our physicians and uh I Love that we're employing now over a thousand people locally\nBut a lot of the facilities that we open like the imaging center a lot of those images were leaving to go to Cleveland and Pittsburgh and we have a new spine center coming up a lot of those things are happening right now in Pittsburgh and Cleveland so I look at it that um\nThe financial side of it normally comes I mean if you if you do your diligence but you just do things the right way to make sure people need um\nA need the ah the service that's being provided than it normally works out okay\nAnd and and I also want to talk to you about your relationship with the doctors because there's a special ... as they talked about a special relationship bed Moran ski with the patients there's a special relationship with the doctors and how they liked this facility and how they how refreshing they are to be doctors again my family doctor is Dr Josie now\nAnd a great guy who's who's with your organization but he has a chance now\nTo be a doctor and not have to worry about an office right I mean south what started and and still is is a partially owned physician own hospital it's\nA full acute care hospital and I think the difference\nHas been that uh I never have taken for granted the and take took taken a look at physicians as a commodity um the physicians and everyone who works at all of our facilities have gone to school a long time and take great pride in what they do and with south towards um\nAnd them being my partner's I've always looked at them as partners so when you take a look at like a joke you know Joe got to a point where it got very difficult doing all that he was doing and running a practice he comes into south words we've ... basically allow him to continue to do the great doctor Josie no work\nAnd guess what if there's an employee issue or somebody's off or if there's a leak or if the if the computer's not working or all the stuff that we all deal with every day we have people to take care of that and guess what Joe senior ... can be a doctor again and have to be an IT specialist and everything and to me it's all work\nWhich is what which is what any of these guys initially wanted to be they didn't want to be small business guys they wanted to be physician\n... there was a time in medicine that there was so much money a excess money that you didn't really have to be a good\nBusiness person you always have changed that they have changed so you could have your spouse\nRunning your practice you could have two people stealing off you and you still have probably the nicest car on the block those times are now gone ... between the way the insurance companies dealing with medicine and just how tough it is there's just not enough hours in the day to to make it worthwhile to run that kind of business anymore\nAs mad as a matter of fact ... doctors today are basically not making any more money they have to see more patients than ever to make the same amount of money there's a lot wrong in medicine today\nYeah you're trying to solve a lot of those battles and the sad thing is I'm everybody looked at doctors and\nSay you know they're ... you know the made us poor and the you know the limo drivers poor\nAnd all of that and their families but they're they're the one entity in health care that are not allowed to come together and lobby for more money so if if two doctors conspire to change your price or to do something you know the the the government's going to be all over him so\nTo me over the last Twenty years as the insurance company's profits have risen and they're able to lobby and do everything in Washington or in a hurry endorsements have shrunk right the reimbursements to the physicians have shrunk has shrunk what you and I are pained to the insurance companies\nBut from a reimbursement standpoint did a strong and a from\nTheir standpoint then at some point probably about six seven years ago a and they don't teach this in medical school that they had to become business people and and it's tough for some of them and it took away from as you said them being physicians\nBut as the south woods obviously as outpatient things you know for colonoscopy things like that that you get done on an outpatient basis but ... in the beginning did you I I don't think in the beginning you ed rooms for people to stay overnight or procedures like that when did that change\nWell we we continue to evolve I think we've had probably nine or ten expansions over the twenty two plus years\nAnd uh it was one of those things it's like people are asking me not we don't have an emergency room now it's like when are you going to open an emergency room when are you going to give us a medical bad that if we have our gall bladder on the weekend and we go into emergency we want to have done the south was way\nSo over those twenty two years we've continued to add on and change and when I saw a lot changing so when President Obama took over\nA there was a a whole hospital exception where physicians were able to own a piece of a hospital another surgery center but an acute care hospital if they own a piece of the whole thing so\nAh right when President Obama came into office September of that year two thousand eight we went under construction and added and converted into an acute care hospital so we were license for thirty six beds we now have Thirteen hours\nWe have a five or six in ... the sweets at the time and uh open them\nWith a joint commission crediting us uh I think it was an April Fool's day of two thousand nine so since two thousand nine we'll have our tenth anniversary is a full acute care hospital\nYou now could have your knee done at that facility like I had you could have a ... section and stay seven or eight days are the only thing is they're all a cases Ron that are still\nUm decided by you and your doctor when you're coming there not by fate so you know if if you have a bad gall bladder and you're feeling that then you go have a blood\nTest and we could schedule ... you're having a down to south towards what people are complaining about right now is what happens like I said if it's on the weekend and we can't control what we need to south was emergency room so that's\nThat's ... just as a sign out what's it like when a vision becomes a reality because this was your vision in the beginning and it's now become a reality that's growing and and as achieved almost a standard unto itself\nIs a very very proud but I I hate to say that I grew up under some great mentorship one of them being ... so my my people\nGive you for that [laughter] I mean you know let me take a shower now now we're getting along so well\nIf he uh he threw us off the field Wisconsin week when we were ranked number one in the country my senior year\nAnd I thought it was talk of totally about football but it was much greater than that\nAnd and he said you you never stay the same if you guys think you've arrived as an individual or a team and you could go throw your helmet on the field than pat yourself on the back because Wisconsin's working harder than you are right now and they're going to knock you off and\nAfter the fact and he and I were great friends still is death I told him I said that and I and I had something to do with football but there's so much to do in life so\nI we celebrate our successes but my head sad to say is probably already ten years ahead of where we should be just to make sure we continue to stay relevant and continued to deliver the healthcare that our community needs so that we could stop the out migration of\nContinued to have to go to Pittsburgh and Cleveland out by the way that that allows more nurses and Sierra ... to graduate from why issue and the whole thing works\nYou set a spine Institute is coming\nYeah ah it's ah in the final stages right now under construction it's the final piece of the old cheating to Research Center that we purchased a\nAbout two years ago now that totally renovated and it's a fifty thousand square foot spine and pain Centre of excellence so right now we have\nPeople in medication management for their back pain people that have procedures for back paying people to go see their doctors for back pain people having to go see their spine surgeon for back pain ultimately all going to different facilities so\nI'm ultimately then they would leave Youngstown and go have spine surgery at ... pm see in Pittsburgh so that facility that will open some time in the middle of the winter early spring\nUm is gonna house all of those services under one roof most of the doctors and extenders are already hired a they're in six officers right now so we're very excited as are the\nPrimary care docs and everybody that used them that instead of having to go to five or six places will be under one roof\nIs it tough to get doctors to come to Youngstown\nUm it's tough for some of the specialties a recruiting a a heart surgeon or a gastro doctor versus a family doctor live here and wants to come back might be a little bit more difficult but

been\nListening to Iranian from working now being in your favorite\nBack at ... from a really the founder and division of south what you call it the south which standard but you know the strange thing is I call it the ... because I mean it's it's it's what people ... it's it is changing health\nCare and it's what people are now starting to expect when they go\nTo health care I don't know ... or actually even tell you this you know I've had people that when the when they were in your facility they would say well come and buy in if you're hungry even though you're a visitor look at even though you're a visitor do you know this I should probably even say this in front of him he probably doesn't know they'll feed you did you know that\nI Know I came up with him on duty when I when I was hesitant to even say anything damn I didn't want to get the kitchen staff in trouble but there but there's people\nThat go up and visit people in the rooms and they will make them a meal\nYeah hundred percent but think about it that helps and the whole healing process we send people home with meals so so that's my side of it not being a clinician I look at it and say if you have friends up there are coming to visit a lot of them are there during dinner hour for taking time out of their day if they're hungry get 'em or\nYou know and we give him the whole menu and uh the human race is pretty damn good because the amount of laser lobsters that we ended up selling uh are are not that much so from that standpoint but person in the room takes advantage of it they appreciate it\nAnd I feel that it's the non clinical side of\nOf trying to you know allowing people to to feel the south which loving to maybe help the healing process just a little\nBit seem concerned because whenever I visit anyone at south woods and I ask him about that to the first time visiting says oh no they stopped that years ago you better go home\n[laughter] you know I I mean they just don't want me to stay I mean I'm getting a little\nBit concerned about all that can you talk a little bit I Want to talk about your ratings here because I was looking southward five star rating it's the only local hospital or see five star rating the highest possible score from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services that's impressive\nSo Medicare takes a look at it wrong two ways there's two five star standards ... one is more customer service based and one is more quality based\nOn how many ... missions you have how many infections you have that side of things and I am proud to say that South will just want to Seventeen facilities around the country\nI think the only one in Ohio that received a five star rating on both sides of that so not that that means much we we don't even publicize it that much because what are marketing people tell us and the people kind of expect that anyway\nBut I mean while when I get together with our dogs in our employees I mean what a thing to applaud in boardman Ohio and the moaning valley to the CEO of you know with a little bit of leadership and a little bit of love that you could achieve those kind of high school because it's it's\nIf we become a society contrary to what those marketing people say I think we've become a society where everyone reads her views on line you know when you buy a product in that kind of stuff where it ... it kinda matters more I mean we're we're changing culture don't you think where you say well wait a minute that's five star from a patient care and services\nThat can be a decision factor I Can't do it can do most people will or insurance allow them to go to south woods are you ah ah I mean how does that process we're\nWe're we're on what just about all of the insurances there there are some\nUm like with some local or other health care facility employees that maybe they don't want them to go to south once for whatever reason but for the most part just about every body a that is on a plan either Medicare plan or a a a normal health plans could or could get into south was\nAll right so you know you can certainly ... if you have a procedure scheduled they go through all that you don't have to do anything right correct\nYeah they do all the pre approvals both on and all of our weather's sleeper imaging or breast care a or a surgery or an Oscar be paying our people\nIn the days and I and I want to go back over here the days of this these black and white images I mean talk about the advances that we have made you know we see 'em on cell phones we see it on our home TV from a physician's standpoint the advances that are made to be able to see problems with technology are a lot better are they not today\nAbsolutely compare that to the days in a black and white TV in a high definition HDTV now that you have\nThere is no comparison that we have the latest technology at the energy in fact we have three Tesla magnet to on them\nAnd it's before can now be down in the area in one hand on we have to how we have the latest technology and ... we had does you know in reading and a gene which we believe ... standard of care that\nI got to tell you this has nothing to do with south words but this was a this is just when you talk standard of care years ago many many years ago when I broke my leg and to the doctor that I knew that was taken care of it and I was waiting in his\nYou know this is after I was cast and everything and he had the nurse spring in every piece of equipment that looked like it would be used at torture somebody\nThat had nothing to do with me I mean I saw some big needles and everything in his pants that came in before he came in and I'm sitting there and I'm looking at that kind of stuff he thought it was hilarious [laughter] I Will never forget that and I just thought you know that that was a pretty good job cuts they\nDidn't have it at south woods but I'm guessing ... stuff that you can use over there once in a while when the bosses and look at it that kind of stopped paying ready for you [laughter] you're saying [laughter] there you go in and say I say out the door\nSo it so you don't need it appointments you can make an appointment she can get
