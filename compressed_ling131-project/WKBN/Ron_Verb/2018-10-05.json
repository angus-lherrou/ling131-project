I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what he's saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really might impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought her level of the seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you had the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant ah with with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the\nFinest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a come Halloween legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nUh was free counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence in fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was very little probably the most impressive I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold year now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion\nAnd Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon

evening she knew that because of that just says she would've needed or of right\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they weren't the one\nWho drove her home or where in the car with her that night and professor Ford also indicated that even though he left that small gathering of six to ... people up rapidly and without saying goodbye and to try none of them\nCall during the next

fewer five four decision and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court\nIs restart Mr President I Will vote chicken for judge cabinet\nAnd with that Susan Collins announcing I think one of the well I'm going to be honest I thought it was the most powerful speech\nIn recent memory on the Senate floor that I've ever seen it was Thoreau it was sober it was smart it was bought bullet was comprehensive\nShe went through everything from judicial temperament and philosophy to her own belief system how she came to her decisions are constitutional view on the Supreme Court\nOn the role of advice and consent on the madness and the circus that has broken out in this country\nAnd um I I have I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important

happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people without any corroborating evidence weighed judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhat really realize today is I don't know her well\nShe doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this is the seriousness the intellect\nThe the systematic she walked every American through hard decision making process and frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and she had it ... it was\nObvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of\nThis process did all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative and and now I guess the left is about as unhinged the ban I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point Senator Lindsey Graham\nOf South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him\nAnd he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what do you know about Susan Collins and you'd you basically

[noise]\n\nHi Michelle mocking here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit gods now nobody woman goes into a clinic comes out there and there's no police report I helped expose crimes the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not suspect abortion the gods now movie opens October twelfth\nThat's done so much in so little time two years no administration is coming from\nAnd when we went through a lot of that success earlier in the program and a lot of it bears repeating by the way I mean these are ... for a million jobs created since the election more Americans now employed\nThan ever recorded in our history unemployment the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nFour hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs those are the jobs Obama's that never coming back by the way things are only going to get better with the explosion in the energy sector once they can get up and online and in an Warren and continue coal mining the president's saving the coal mining industry in West Virginia singlehandedly\nAnd once we continue to extract more natural gas in the world would ever need in in three hundred years\nWe have all of those ... resources and I have fourteen states record low unemployment ... record low unemployment for Hispanic Americans African Americans Asian Americans youth unemployment fifty five year low median household income\nIts highest record ever recorded\nYou know we have the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for Americans without even a high school diploma and veterans' unemployment has now reached its slowest rate in Twenty years\nAnd four million people off of food stamps and I can just keep on going and promises about the types of judges he put on the court and gutting endless\nBureaucratic regulation that that literally hamstrings all businesses in America promoting buying and hiring America actively promoting and asking people to come and build their factories in manufacturing centers here and creating the economic conditions\nAnd the regulatory conditions where it's possible I mean that's why all these manufacturing jobs are coming back\nOr reducing illegal immigration courts defeating ISIS you know of course pulling out of that idiotic Iranian deal and little rocket man not firing a missile over Japan every other day\nI say that's pretty good but with thirty two days out of the electorate a lot can happen between now and then John McLaughlin is pollster founder McLaughlin associates Doug Jones is with us also a pollster author political analyst for Fox News\nOr thank you both for being with us or we can see I don't know if you want to call the cabin on balance or the\nCabinet awakening there's every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly in the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble and Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down in eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately uh where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's ... percent of the Trump voters a short you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited millions of new voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nMaybe I got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats could look ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that's a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit\nThe Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it and they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was a poll that we did for a super back she's down ... points down uh\nSeeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... is coming back in and\nGalileo well ... ... that Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nAll shot I mean I don't quite know how to fly but I'll give you a ...\nAnd you can just say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is that I'm going to leave the house which I did it lead to pick up the house and I think\nFrom what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job and then you\nAre talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from\nThe Democrats are from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately a benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it starts right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs going to have it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\n[noise] let let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man for support you're\nSitting ... disgusting and everybody who like touring experimenting Arlen than things\nThat you know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences with\nA judge Kavanaugh I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct that the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archer just Sherry destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug don't make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the dark has put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape of that women are people people weren't right during the ... it was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nRight as we wrap up with our pollsters we'll be checking in with them often now thirty two days out of election day and I think the most important midterms are a lifetime of John McLaughlin Doug shown with us All right Doug ... productions what's gonna happen\nI think covered or is going to be confirmed you will have the Republicans holding the Senate or narrowly and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty plus thirty bucks\nWow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could discount thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they're electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest hope John McLaughlin\n[noise] I think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks up over four weeks ago election happened but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is is to real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer she needs to take them on they're going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nUp for next year so we've got to do is it supposed to lift actual survey ahead of fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on in the house and and\nPrior to cabinet looked like we were going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy for her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take on every day about\nThem wrong wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swap runs the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate seats\nAlright thank
