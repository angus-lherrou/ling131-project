Democrats\nThe Democrats at me so disgusted it's it's unbelievable I mean I have are just so disgusted\n[noise] she didn't act on that letter she she sat on it trying to run the clock out\nAnd so that's the way in a leaks it somehow to the media\n\nSo this is all political to me as far as the timing they don't care about this woman they'll use or for whatever agenda they have\n\nTheir they got a double standard on how they treat members of their own party versus how they treat any Republican\nConservative Republican so now we're going back\nWhat thirty five thirty six years back to high school\n\nShe's saying this happened as you guys know and none of these people can cooperate you know are are saying yeah that's that's what happens\nBut every once oh I Believe are I Believe are\nNow he's got to prove that ah that he didn't do it you know there's this shadow of a doubt\nYou know what if she's lying what if it wasn't him what if he's telling the truth all these people that say oh I find it very believable I Believe ... so what you're not guilty until proven innocent have we come to that if we've\nCome to that I feel sorry for all men\nYou know and as far as women are concerned I don't think all women are buying into this 'cause you know white women have husbands women have sons just as I talk about or you know men have daughters just like talking about all that well women have sons and they look at this and I don't think they all are I don't think every woman is saying boy I Believe her\n\nThere's just no\nNo one else there to substantiate her version her story whatever\n\nSo you start right there and of course he just denies that is you know\n\nBut you know oh you got so angry that I saw side of him I didn't like really who wouldn't be pissed if the if this was coming after you time and time again did you watch any of this if you see how distraught his wife looked sitting here how upset she was how his mother and father upset hop said he was with the whole thing\n\nAnd he denies every bit of it\n\nYou know we've come to a point I Want you to think about this we've come to a point this is ridiculous were elected officials because they're white old guys\nGod they can't ask this woman any questions we got to bring in a woman we got to see you know give your you give your time over to this woman because of what the uh the uh the appearance of it this is crazy\nBecause your water white old guy you can't ask this woman any questions or any heart she saying some pretty nasty things about this guy\nWithout really proof of it so you can't sit there\nAs an elected official even though you're an old white guy I don't know what that's got to do with anything and asked your own questions\nWhy because it looks bad looks like it might be picking on her\n\nSo we're more concerned about the image of that\nThan we are getting to the bottom of it\nWere more concerned about that than we are getting to the bottom and think about that\nSo we go get this prosecutor she's a woman will let her ask questions because we don't want to look like old guys picking on this woman it'll look bad whoever made that decision has it come down to now well you know what are you you know if you're a guy you can't ask anyone any woman questions about this even tougher and hard questions because it looked like you're picking on her\nNose should look like you're trying to get to the truth\nThat's number one that upsets me\nHow the Republicans on that committee cave by not staying I'm not doing that I'm going to ask my own questions\n\nHow they came and brought this woman in a deal with it\nRight off the bat worried about the image it would make of old white guys asking tough questions\nAs they come down to that seriously think about that has come down to that now that's where we are today\nOh you can do your job you're a white guy you can't ask her questions and look bad\n\nThat's the first thing that annoys me\nThat the Republicans gave into that at all\n\nYou know it would have been the best scouting asset one of the questions if you're going to appoint someone Trey Gowdy because he's just a damn good lawyer and asking questions to try to get to the facts and the troops he would have been the best\nIf you know who that is he would have been outstanding\nBut it's a damn shame\nThat if you're a man you can't even ask this woman making accusations against somebody you're going to be voting on your own questions out of your own mouth and your own brain and your own follow up because of the image it gives what a load of crap\n\nAnd then all these people they just believer we believe are we believe are I Believe ... I Believe her we don't believe him or he looked like he was angry like he was pissed why because of what everybody saying about him who wouldn't be\nWe don't believe his dinner and we don't believe that we don't believe that we believe her\n\nLike they're psychotic I thought you were innocent until proven guilty oh it's a job interview no this is that this is a pretty serious accusation are making against the guy\nAnd I and I think somebody's deserves the benefit of the doubt on something along these lines so now let's get the FBI out even though all of these witnesses signed statements\nThat if they lied on him are subject to perjury all of them\nUnbelievable so let's just delay it more I don't know it's politics at its ugliest\nIs absolute the Democratic party how they sat on this or they want to run the clock out how they're using this woman the Republicans on that committee who didn't have the man who had to ask the questions themselves were more concerned about image and truthfulness\n\nThis whole thing stinks to high heaven to me\n\nAnd then as you know you got all these women that are his classmates even back in the days since you know this was kind of a small town of this stuff was going on we all know\nAnd then I started thinking jeez you know when I went to school every one one do 'cause everyone talks\n\nSo it is I feel sorry for him\nI really I really feel sorry for that guy\nBut he's got to go on give an interview talk about too when he lost his virginity and what he did and\nDidn't do\nAny ... any is there to become a Supreme Court judge what an invasion of his own or his own privacy on many facets of it\n\nAnd then is a woman with the whole gang rape thing which is just a nut job she's just a nut job\n\nSo you know what I Believe him I guess I guess what he's innocent my eyes till proven guilty and she certainly didn't proven guilty what's her story 'cause nobody there cooperates or her story\n\nSo now the FBI they got a week to look into it and watch this is the FBI comes back and says well we you know it is we pretty well hurt it to be that won't be enough for the Democrats never cats won't say well and that's the case will give them the benefit of the doubt will vote for him now I ...

not have this ever come out and not enough of wrath of it\nRight I mean the ... the timing of this letter or the ... ... how long they sat on the Democratic party use this woman\nAbsolutely I agree completely\nThey totally used in exploited her as far as I'm concerned an inch and a and they don't care if they destroy this guy they just don't want him on the court it doesn't matter\nTo them and his family as well and it's it's really just it's got to hear them talk about it but that's the way\nRight it is you know I'm going to tell you something uh honestly I've had several people who've come up to me personally honest to God who said I Will never vote for another Democrat ever again as a result of this that's how people were that came up to me\nYeah I you know I've I've lost so much respect for the senatorial profits watching what he knew you listen to these hearings quipped it and you can almost going to come out of their mouth before they even\nOpen their mouth and it's it's it's just mind boggling how you know people watched I think it's genuine and they think that you know the Senate or don't have a political agenda and that there there's no way that they\nHave something going on behind the seem to think that they they cared\nAbout Ford no they don't care about for what they care about is married have an aunt and getting their way and putting off a nomination to the court that's slapped on here and there is no more to\nIt right there they're hoping first of all I thought Hillary Clinton would be making these appointments outlets realistic right off the bat so they were hoping for that then they're hoping to do to run the clock out hoping that the Democrats take control so that they can stall it\nEven more that's the game plan but I'm telling you the whole scope of things\nI Am disgusted by the Democratic party and of course Sherrod Brown and Tim Ryan are right there with the party believing this woman and and taking her side they don't even have the guts to say there is a reasonable doubt here I mean there are ... ... ... ... you couldn't get a conviction anywhere\nI mean that the woman that broke my heart right in a\nHouse where I Am a political house or I've gone to court for the whole the whole thing this was manipulated from start to finish from Diane Feinstein she knew what she was doing mhm\nShe knew and the only reason for this was they're afraid because he is quite right okay and he's a good jurists they're afraid that he's not going to back their site on all these things including abortion\nCan you imagine oh can you pause imagine that we've got to a point where elected officials because they're white men can't ask questions they got to say well we better have on with we've gotten to that point in our life\nWhat we we have okay and they should have had a little more testicular Larry yes yes they should have and you know ... and they would have asked\nBetter question she was so easy because she felt bad or whatever where she didn't know what questions I don't care how experience she was she was not good enough she didn't get to anything\nRight she really didn't watch the tape again I saved it just to watch she was ...\nOkay so and and the thing is have they not have the Republicans not alert okay man we meet men\nRight okay well we don't need maps and there are a few that are met\nWell I

tour um they called her a national hero a yeah I Will remember\nYou as a true patriot they're not worried about getting to the truth none of one of them actually asked her a question but I actually like to touch based on what the whole thing is about\nAnd that's that Donald Trump um\nHow about today I don't know if you've really talked about it much but I'm NAFTA you're remember that yes\nI I mean people see what people are and understand that it's all a renegotiation to actually get back at China and and\nPeople don't understand that the ... are starting to fall NAFTA's done airs the new deal between us Canada and Mexico\nWhich is a ... with the details are yet to come but but from what I'm lead to understand how much fairer deal to the United states\nA NAFTA was a horrible deal we know that this is a big deal I agree with you hey by the way it will Tim Ryan insured brown come out today and say this is really a game change we're really proud of the president\nUm I'm going to guess I'm now on on that why why\nWhy not they've been bichon about NAFTA for years and now are and how bad it is so now you actually have somebody who did something about it who legitimately did something about it and renegotiated it and uh and so a much better deal why wouldn't they say good job because he's Trump I forgot because\nTerrorists terrorists are bad for the American worker you know there's every talking point you can imagine but uh you're always comes back down to China that we have now that now we have a handshake Europe all of a sudden all of us are going to get together and we can all tell China now and say hey you to play fair we'll play with you\nThe ... it's us right now but now we're starting to get deals with other countries have dominoes is starting to fall\nAnd you know all these callers that called that that you call and actually oppose any Tara that we're putting on\nI just I shake my head because if anybody else's driving on the road you know why we don't see any Volkswagen pickup trucks out there\nBecause there is a twenty five percent tariff on them because in Nineteen Seventy they wouldn't let us sell chicken in Europe\nAnd you know what happens it's not like the American worker is paying an extra twenty five percent for a Volkswagen truck what happens is we just alter are buying habits and we don't buy him so Volkswagen doesn't even bother saw live near we buy Ford F. one fifty isn't Chevy she'll Silverado and that that's what's gonna happen with all the cheap stuff that comes over from China\nSo be it I don't know what people are doing\nOr what it might even about oh this is a agree with you this is a big deal that will get you ... wait and see let's see how much attention it gets not saying I'm not saying it because this is this is a huge thing which will\nGreatly you don't want this guy has a lot of\nYou use the term that I Want to use that I Can't say Trump has a lot of you know what did he actually did

about any of this but then I always think to myself you know there's going to be\nA time two years from now and there's another election and Donald Trump is going to be dating somebody and actually John Arnold went out a good point last week there might not be anybody wants to run against them because now your high school yearbooks gonna come out now somebody can falsely accused you of sexually\nDoing whatever they think you you forty years ago and it gets investigated I find it hard to believe somebody you can actually want to run against Trump but the thing is they're going to have to put Trump on CNN next to somebody else and every other network and everybody's going to watch that because that will be bigger than the super bowl again\nAnd guess what I'm going to step back it up maybe as big as asset is is dirty laundry is all out in the open there's nothing\nMore years but you know I've asked them how about this for biggest assets\nResults how 'bout ... how 'bout how 'bout for as long as I can remember for the first thing you got rid of TPP cut corporate taxes he cut regulation he's got NAFTA done he's just moving right along restoring manufacturing to the United

you explain that to me why that that's now that thirty five years ago\nAnd there's evidence right I mean they're not it's not it's not only just now there's actual physical evidence that he has done this\nBut can you explain that to me you know when when you only when you look at a double standard of how these same people treated Bill Clinton was doing this at the time how these same people treated this Ellison at the time how they treat their democratic colleagues versus how they're treating this guy\nOn some on an allegation thirty five years ago and how they keep changing the goal

looking at the price of everything that's going up as a matter of fact yes it is I every competitor I have ... so we used to ... we use interactive brokers we see the marriage rate for custodians\nUm fidelity like the people I can believe it or not I compete with my own custodian so fidelity and Charles Schwab in a a teenager they have their own financial advisors and and I'm using their platform to trade in in the management clientele and what do you mean\nYou use their platform but you run the show\nExactly so let's say you want to deal with a guy like me and you just want to know somebody at fatality for hotel let's\nSay for example I don't want to deal with a guy like you I Want to get a financial guy that doesn't pay attention to my account\nAnd a could care less about ... looking at what the market's doing and trading and buying and selling even worse I Want something like that let's say even worse than I Do not even then I don't want to I Want a guy with a beard that I can go to and say I'm thinking about retiring and that's going to say\nWell let me take a look here you know it's even worse than that Ron these people that are those commercials\nThey slap 'em investment licenses on these folks at fidelity and see the marriage rate cetera and they give them a script to say\nThey have no idea what the hell they're doing they're just dumb their their experience there exactly where I was at Ninety nine in this business they weren't there they're they're they're trying to act the part when they really don't know that part of the\n... the carrying of the big badge with them the fidelity badge and believe it or not some people are Huntington that nonsense I Would much rather loser clients who are a fellow financial advisor around here and has his own shop or her own shop that's an jerk off it\nBut I got to be marriage rights sitting in a setting in a cubicle somewhere that as like Fifteen thousand clients that has no idea what the heck he's doing it drives me nuts but people do that if\nI still say this folks listen ... listen to me I bet the majority you know not talking John our clients I bet the majority of true or false majority you\nThat ah have investments with an investment advisor\nNever hear from them and uh never hear from any ... any doesn't really do anything you put you in stuff and forget about you so seriously the majority you listing if our if you're a financial advisor or financial investor\nYou know like I'm not talking about your four O. one K. you know I ... I Do I Do my four oh one K. here and I get my returns and I look at it and all that kind of stuff but you're in charge of that really you you are in charge here four one K. a John can help you out with that if you want some advice on it but outside of that I'm just since most financial guys true or false fellow stars\nThey don't pay attention they they they shake your hands glad to get your money how much you got Fifteen thousand okay let's invest it we're going to put it in this okay thanks for comment and then that's it\nThe the the asset gather isn't there were what I was my first five six years to where\nIt was a political game kissing babies shaking hands gathering assets taking people to last they can be even a golf with him in an investment I mean I get high and write a new one and have a nice day and then you know and then when it goes down and say well just you know got to stay with it or to come back I I can hear it\nWell I have not only that it's just like for instance I I Will say that I Would be the first one to say I don't communicate a lot with our clients as far as like how is your day going and we need them for what I communicate through when they see their trades where they see the portfolio oh John did this in the counter John did that are\nRough this much percentage and a quarter century he must be doing something I Am\nSo we might do what the point I was trying to illustrate as far as competing with my own advice or custodians was that we haven't raise our prices and every single custodian and our a shop around us has raised her prices for one quarter all the way to ... percent\nAnd I think that's crazy so um\nI don't know how people get ... you know ... and the thing and then that's that's kosher but thinking about this is someone charges one according to two percent plus the treaty fees\nHow much money to someone have to make just to break even\nSecondly I'm I I ... you know there'll be a day where I probably have to raise raise the quarter tenth to keep in line with a profit margin but I didn't feel that um that we've done enough internally to cut costs that to to make that justifiable so\nWill justify you know what we do is we we went to strictly email 'em\nOr copier costs are way down in the ... you know your email your clients right the doctor bills yeah so we did a lot of things internally and I felt like we should we should attack ourselves first\nAnd budget versus raise the fees on the clients and basically whoever washes out washes out and ruined Keith Keith with us I don't think that's fair\nSo we just have a different mentality and model ... just a very clients so you've kept your fee right where it's at ... and and why that's so significant as everybody else razors All right and it is and I'm as far as I Know well your expenses\nGo up to yeah I'll go out there but but you keep your ... your fee there which explain to our listeners how\nWhat John Arnold he's an active money manager and how does ... John traits of stock for you if if he says okay we're going to sell lists and get out of it or any can do that without calling you you don't pay for the trade in buying it or selling it you don't pay he sat right you pay for it\nYeah so we eat we eat all the fees that huge too I it is these are see my training the costs of the end of the month I wouldn't want to see it already five hundred bucks right and you but you don't pass that on a client now we'd say\nAny does that cause it [laughter] I Love it he drove me crazy 'cause he would say it's not right if you're losing money and I saw your stock I make money than if you buy another stock that I make more money that's out right so he eats every trading cause he pays for it you don't pay for it you pay him a\nQuarter to quarter percent no one wall to one percent per month or one percent of your [laughter] so we don't let out of the line and tell them one there's another ... commercial from you so a lot of financial advisors they either charge one percent of front or quarterly a quarter percent per quarter or at the end of the year one percent\nAnd I don't think that's fair because ... illustrate two thousand sixteen which was Donald Trump's first year you\nKnow the market was average to to pour it in two thousand sixteen we we sucked right with it\nAnd how fair would have been to me I've got my hundred percent of my feet up front and then the clients count was average or even went down and then November when Trump gets in she's treated like a bottle rocket\nYou know the client and make that money during that time I didn't know what or even worse if I got paid at the end of the cycle\nAt the end of the year I took my feet off the highest amount for the year that's still not right so I thought client listen I'm going to ride the market up and down monthly with you is we're going to end in any other thing I knew charging once in a while to one percent is that means the majority of your money's inside you're kind of work and free\nHigh church one percent of front or one percent of the end of the year that means that money's not working for either so and and and combine that with our open book a policy meaning that there's no handcuffs on us there is no loads of those renders new one out of Journal of management you pick up the phone call you know great call\nSo do you look over done and the story and the relationship the clients have a hundred percent of the art or from I'm calling for nothing my results in my performance and they want to stay you refer me to do and I and I and that's without sounding arrogant because my thing is if you can back up what you're saying that's not arrogance confidence so on and I can't so\n[laughter] and that's it and that's what really keeps who'd gone so that's how you pay one one twelve of one percent a gr ... on a on a monthly basis and if you lose money then you don't make as much money\nThey exactly and that's how it should be you should hurt in when with the client period I don't know why that is such a hard grasp for for the folks that don't want to do that or can't afford it that's not\nBecause I'm ... I'm going to tell you why that his job 'cause it's all about them it's not about the client it's a different paradigm I blame the clients do let me tell you got for falling for that I totally do that for enabling them\n... you know there's only so many times where you call the cops come to your house and you stay with your husband's beating you every once in a while you're the enabler mhm so if you decide to stay with Joe ... because he takes you golfing or does magic tricks or does a movie night or whatever Crazy Stupid things that these people do that are entertainers in our financial advisors\n\nIn the valley good afternoon I'm ... jury selection begins today for thirty two year old parents admin peace talks with attempted murder actively taking Saccone Thurston\nIn July she was shot in the hat and found slumped over the driver's seat of a car on ... avenue she survived the gunshot wound he rejected a plea deal this morning Las Vegas is remembering the fifty eight people who were killed one year ago today when a gunman opened fire to country music festival\nAt exactly Canada won this evening Las Vegas strip will go dark\nThe White House is authorizing the FBI to expand its investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nThe expansion comes to one condition that review must be finished by the end of this week and it is the wedding temper on record for young found the national weather service has seven point nine one inches of rain fell they September the ... monthly rainfall record with seven point oh eight inches back in twenty eleven\nHas the power Chevrolet Buick GNC of Calcutta, Ohio news around I'm happy David\nHard radio goes one on one with leaders of Al Bell\nTo discuss the first time they hurt themselves on the radio\nWe were in\nRochester New York at our time we heard very personal but don't live here um because after midnight last night he has like [laughter] that often and ... that are in a ...\nThe lowest you felt that later in life that lately I have crying like I say in the fall and problem with that whole\nHousing [laughter]\nBe listening I heard radio for\nAnd all your favorite artist\nIs not necessarily represent abusive I heartbeat securities\nAn advisory services offered through investor Corp member F.

advisor or tax adviser before making any investment decisions\n[noise] this is Jay Arnold wealth management show on\nRadio five Seventy two and a curious six thirty three segments to John are all ... it's a journal wealth management show news radio five Seventy nobody gave me in\nA in a John is are talking about some of the moves that he made in to a a of a away from military end up biotech a arena that's just one of the recent most when we last talked you said a lot of times you're sticking with\nUh the areas that you were in because they're doing so well but you don't need to move a lot of stuff from that's a good thing though right\nIt is ... it's it's frustrating for me is mystery for the clients because not as long as they're making money yeah but you know what you're looking at this from the client's perspective here they are paid me a one percent fee to manage money\nHold on a second this is what drives me crazy when you do this is that they come in and bring your money and you figure out and you guys agree on the wrist scenario then you put them in in an area that meets their scenario so they're doing well in that scenario\nSo you're not going to just make moves so it looks like you're doing something you're going to stay in that scenario so the client they're not calling and complaining as long as they're making money in your own head you're thinking boy should do move it around no it was the right pick in the first place is what I'm trying to say to you\nKnow I hear you loud and clear but again look at this from a client's perspective\nIf I Am touting myself as a money manager investment advisor\nAnd they're holding say Seventy percent of the same holding so they did a year and a half ago regardless of how much they're out they're getting a little itch in their heads saying oh I have this guy for no they were tired of looking at you with now here's the truth\nI haven't had one client say that but I'm looking at this for the ... the only way they can be half your client is and thinking that way\nI don't know if I was a climate that normally held for four years we've had I had surgery now for three years\nUm the the the the building sector long time\nHealth care sector long time I mean some of the stuff as long as it's used but it's still kicking ass so so why would you change it they were the ones I Want to live gentler moneys and\nUm and you are in the end if I Do find the right now so I'm going to stay running the same planes get in touch downs what it is in the back of my mind is I always look at things will be a ...\nLike ... what what I think of this fall it matters is are they making money are you concerned over the price of oil going up just the opposite you are a\n... you know you and I we're never going to do their favorite [laughter] I don't think he does is to drive me crazy folks know\nDrive me crazy why would you mind if if people can make more wages on oil and buy more product to buy more monitors is that's a good thing versus paying another fifty cents for gas\nCosts you more money to fill up your car and it takes money out of your pocket to go do something else for for that energy if you will as long as gas prices stay around two fifty to sixty two Seventy whatever under three bucks but ... why why Israel going up\nYou [laughter] reason yeah let's go okay I Do um I Want to hear it the supply and demand is in favor now of the oil producers because of a strong economy well the Saudis re in oil down to defeat our natural gas fracking yeah yeah yeah I put it on her I mean you look at\nHow much energy we had his in Columbia county alone mhm there may be scared on the death and they purposely you know burned while literally burned it and was held it and ah\nOver supplied the market in some ways in the mid ... late in the Senate oil under twenty to twenty five dollar a barrel mark\nAnd now all that kind of that that talk of wars over I think that once I got what they want or the other side got what they want it and we're probably going to get equilibrium of Seventy five to eighty dollars a barrel which was we're probably will need to be\nUm and that's where my will lie on oil wells that's when that's where we need to be to make seven or eight percent returns on our on our oil royalty so uh it's a good thing for John or not it's a good thing for my folks that work in the oil industry\nIt's about they've run rubber as a lawn care business so I I get I I Do feel your pain and I agree with you to extend but among the where lose the war to win the battle uh-huh excuse me a while I gotta I gotta bring first when I lose the battle out when the war yeah\nThere you go but uh but oil as oil is coming up what the effect I'm rainy where they're talking about raising interest rates again commonplace going to happen\nAnd having the money is too cheap right now ... says the author you though that it is sometimes it seems to me like do they want to shoot a good thing in in\nThe foot when they're doing this or what what what was your ... talking about the reason why\nThey ... they lowered interest rates to zero right mhm back in ... was the reason 'cause it sucked the life out of a sudden Ann Arbor right we're ... to remember that yeah the uh\nIt was a is Anita thing we needed to give corporations the the you know the the doing entice them to lend money to borrow money\nTo hire more people to to to build more product because they're getting hurt on some of the other side's well now what happens if you have if you have too much if the money is too easy to get with the economy roaring you're in a super inflation so the way they're doing it is correct\nI that's one thing I probably disagree with Trump on his uh the knee he's he's not for the need to raise a quarter to have ... I Am I thinking of I think because of the month should have been raised ... play catch up\nUm but it it there there's that would be fair to say that we probably need another quarter\nOh really so in this day they say that affects inflation and ride it\nKinda yeah ... ... is the free money supply so the money supply\nIs is greatly affected by the interest rate if if you're a billion dollar corporation and you can borrow money basically for free and make your product and make your product employer folks making that brought it with that borrowed money and then those people get to buy buy goods and services at home than it trickles down\nA debt creates inflationary effect\nAnd so if you make the money a little bit more expensive harder to get exposed to back that down a little bit\nDo you worry about the tariffs John Arnold tear gas while you're not and\nI'm In touch with folks and just got to believe me on this I Can't say I'm In touch with folks there in a very upper echelons of of of where that would the tariff would\nHurt the majority of them say no we're trying to say listen it's all propaganda in my heart as a couple of bucks we're going to pass it on to the maybe the consumer uh ten cents uh-huh\nIf you are you and I agree I Know on this is nothing significant yeah no I Would rather pay just I'll tell you the examples at a grocery store today and I told the lady this\nI Would rather pay more to keep you employed and go through the the automated check out I Would rather pay ten cents more secret keep a guy like my dad pulling the lever or put it in a windshield a gym or driving a car GM test driving it", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "01"}
