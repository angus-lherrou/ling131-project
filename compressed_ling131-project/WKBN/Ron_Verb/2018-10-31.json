dot com [noise] this is news radio\nFive Seventy WKBD or young\nScholar Goldberg a federal grand jury has returned an indictment against the accused Pittsburgh and synagogues shooter Hubbard\nBowers was charged in a forty four count indictment for the shooting deaths of eleven people the tree of life synagogue where court record said he ordered his desire to kill Jews the indictment charges eleven counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and other hate crimes that make powers eligible for the death penalty federal prosecutors have already said they would pursue it\nBy the time we do all of that let's say you have a thousand dollars that you earned you'll take home seven hundred\nBut maybe you won't even take home seven hundred because things have changed there is no company pension anymore that the company pays for if you make enough you have to\nAnd most people will do let's say a five percent contribution to a four O. one K.\nSo now out of that seven hundred maybe you say well five percent of that's going to go to my retirement remembers Social Security is only a supplement plan for your retirement so you stake five percent out of that seven hundred and ... you donate that to your four O. one K.\nAnd there's usually in a private sector costs for healthcare coverage you know you're a contribution that you have to make monthly just for the health care coverage\nAll right like if I told you guys a million times in my case it's about six hundred a month here\nSo that's taken out too so you know once they get beyond the taxes of the thousand dollars you made from the fruits of your labor down to seven hundred and the other things that come out that aren't taxes but\nIf you want to plan for your retirement you gotta have a four one K. and if you want to have health care and you've got to co pay on that just for the coverage that they're so you understand it drifted I'm a ... than I'm laying on you so let's say if you make a thousand dollars maybe a take home six fifty\nAfter all that stuff is paid over the fruits of your labor\nIn of the money you take all my point this out to you guys but I Want you to think about this for money that you take home and I want you to give us some serious thought of that money you take home you have to save so much of that money\nThat's already been tax to pay your property taxes\nSo all that money to the the the portion let's say the two thirds you take 'em out of that two thirds now you've got to set aside a portion of that for your property tax out of that two thirds that you take home you have to set aside fifty cents on every gallon of gas state and federal tax\nOutta that two thirds you take home you have to set aside seven and a quarter percent sales tax in Mahoney county on everything you buy with the exception of food\nWe've extended we've expanded sales tax not just in the percentage up to seven a quarter but also when it's on\nYou know years ago not that many years ago and certainly a few years ago was expanded to services so sales tax is now on more things that it didn't used to be onto so you're paying more sales tax because we're sales taxing more things\n\nThat seven and a quarter percent so what did I say gas tax sales tax property tax either that two thirds that you take home\nThen take a look if you get cable t._v. there's what's called their franchise fee that goes to your township whether that's Austin Town or boardman or wherever you live there is a tax on your cable bill\nLook at it that goes directly to your local governments they get that which is substantial start adding add up and everybody's cable bill look at the end of your cable bill look at the end of your cell phone bill\nTake a look at your cell phone bill and look at all the taxes that are on the end of your cell phone for giving people Obama phones in this kind of stuff take a serious look at that\nYou see these other taxes that you often forget about it on your cable TV bill on your cell phone bill the gas tax a fifty cent sales tax property taxes on that\nTwo thirds remember you're only taken over two thirds of what you made\nIn all those other taxes are coming out of that two thirds\nAnd it's never enough\nSo you see all types of levees on the ballot some worth it some not all types of\nLevees on the ballot people asking for more money more of your money\nOf this limited pool of money that you're taking home saying we need a little bit more we being government you know issue to have mental health man you need to give us more it's\nAn increase we need more of your money give us more we want we want you to say yes so we can take more of your money out of that two thirds it's already getting all these other taxes out of it we want to take more\n\nThat's why I say no to shoot to fry quite frankly that's no way I'm going to vote for that\nAnd\nSo what I'm trying to point out to people is they're under attack\nThere just under attack absolutely under attack you know you got to wrestle with certain things\nAnd it's like a pointed out to you both for Austin ... township have some of the highest middle age in the county which means a lot your property taxes are already pretty significant so if you live in those areas\n\nBut there's property tax levy on there for the police departments which gets about seven hundred and ... thousand dollars out of the general funds\nLet's just say seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar but the new levy would raise just under two million dollars so it's not all\nAbout just taken we don't want to we we want to keep the money in a general funded not spend it on a police not only will they keep that money in a general fund they'll have more ... substantially more money coming in so it's not just about covering the general fund that's nonsense\nThat would be covered you know seven\nHundred something thousand when you're looking at one point seven or one point eight million\nSubstantial you know you have like a million extra dollars coming in I don't know how they come up with that number on that levee to begin with if you're worried about the money coming out of the general funds\nOr is that you're saying let's see what we can get from people in our mind people like in Austin Town township remembered the trustees blew it because the casino was supposed to be paying half a million dollars a year every year but they wrote such a piss poor agreements that the casino got out of it it's nobody's fault but the trustees\n\nNobody's fault but but the trustees that should have wrote an agreement that paid half a million dollars a year for ever as long as the casinos in business but they blew it they dropped the ball they fumble but incompetence was supposed to be coming from that total incompetence now they want it to come from you\nSee I remember these things\nYou don't hear them saying hey we're really blew it with a casino man we wrote a deal that they got out of and we screwed up and that cost us half a million dollars a year now we want you to pay it\nYou don't hear 'em when they say oh you do it while they get seven the police get seven hundred and something thousand out of the general fund but we're asking for more than double latte\nI don't understand that and just to if you will make you know is that just well let's see what we can get\nIt's never enough\nOut of the fruits of your labor so I'm here to represent you as a taxpayer [noise] I get it so now I'm reading in the paper today get a load of this this is why and remember wanted to point out when I said it's never enough remember this\nSo now we have the traffic cameras\nAnother way where we can get more money out of your pockets so it does it still points on your driver's license it's a simple thing it's just about getting money and you know at nine oh two how can we get more take more of your money government take more of your money from you there's nobody greedier then melt the down there and Gerard\nHow can we get more money well we'll get it that way will take these traffic cameras will go out on a freeway and ... and we'll just ah you know see how many ... how much money we can make\nAnd it's spreading like wildfire another way to take more of your money\n\nI'm telling you if you will never be enough it will never be enough every year it's we need more how much more can you afford to give every year [noise]\nYou know it's like it's like I said I support like the Jackson township police levy because they're levy is for the exact amount that they've lost a hundred and something thousand dollars a year it's relatively small levy but that's how much they need just to keep the police department going\nThey weren't asking for any additional money at all that's an honest debate to me that I respect [noise]\nSo then I looked at in the paper today and I see well you know Youngstown Scott big budget problems that shouldn't surprise anybody right\nSo you know they ... they got big thing to say the firefighters unit proposed fees this is in Youngstown attacks as it could generate money for the city's\nFire and police department's Christopher Weaver the unions secretary gave the presentation while he provided monetary figures Weaver said he was open any suggestions so what is Christopher Weaver say Christian ... says we need to get more of your money\n[noise] why don't we do this at Christopher Weaver says a fee for Youngstown State university students per semester how about Seventy five dollars per semester that would be a hundred and fifty a debt dollars a year\nPer student has nothing to\nDo with your college and the cost of education he's proposal is what's tax let's get more money from people go into

W came and listeners the it it's the I think that the people from the outside of your listening audience that don't see it and don't care\nWell if you pay it you care in in in my concern is where do you think this is going to be in five years where do you think this is going to be in ten years\nI mean in in all seriousness this is so this is so government has gotten so big so expensive in trying to do so much we simply can't afford it we simply\nUnder governor vetoes\nNo if they screwed up the agreement we got money from the government a governor we got a million dollars\n... from the governor of that million dollars for almost seven hundred thousand of it went to the new radio system\nYou know I've been around long enough I passed a levee for a new police cars in the township I pass a law heavy\nYou know are voted for it a ... we got the million dollars from the casino for the radio system in this kind of stuff right so you know all of these ladies that have been passed they haven't gone away they're still coming in\nJust so I just see understand there are still coming in now do all communities have a problem with uh the local government fund absolutely they have a problem with with the local government fun but the answer can't be let's tax people more\nThe answer has to be\nWhat how are we spending the money that we currently have let's take a look at benefit packages are they in line with the private sector at all what are the what are the ... what's the cost sharing what are the duck doubles\nWhat's the cost of healthcare let's take a look at staffing exactly how much do we need not want but need let's take a look at over time and departments you know are you are you a a manager why are you getting overtime if that's the case\nLet's take a serious look at some of these are some of these issues before we start saying you need to pay more because I think people are financially strapped I remind you wash the town of boredom and have some of the highest village\nIn the county right now but go ahead with your thoughts I set it off I Want to hear what you have to say than I'll move along go ahead sir\nWell one thing I Want to bring up is if your son where Ross dump police department would you still being or this levee\nI'm not in support of the levee and that doesn't have it doesn't it doesn't have it doesn't have anything to do let me

daughter think\nThey kind of their own independent thinkers and they vote the way that they want to vote I'm only telling you what I think and what I conclude as a matter of fact some of some of my own family members you disagree with your fearless leader but they're entitled to their opinion and I'm okay with that\nAnd there's people in town shipped to disagree with me but the reality is\nWe have to take a serious look at what at how much more burden do you want to put on property owners can you answer that question for me how much do you pay property taxes\nI pay roughly two thousand a year and my property tax will go an extra four dollars a month or that I can\nWell let me tell you something I pay I pay I pay for a thousand dollars a year\nOh here's will go up another eight dollars a month\nThat no no no no no no let's let's review this if if you want to talk about eight dollars a month it depends what your home is evaluated at if I pay all already over four thousand dollars do you think three hundred and thirty five dollars a month is enough\nHow much do you think I should pay and property taxes it's higher than my gas bill it's higher than my of a electric bill it's higher than my grocery bill\nHow much we're should my ... at what point do I say enough you're you're paying half\nOf what I'm paying now when you get\nTo four thousand and I'll be at six thousand then maybe

[noise]\nTime six o'clock shop America's source for finding hardware buried brothers saw mill can view this as news radio five\nSeven WCBS young [noise]\nI'm dairy all our President Trump talking immigration just days before the midterm elections as he makes his way to Florida campaign rally the president says he could send even more American troops to the southern border as a migrant caravan makes its way through Mexico\nRights and and and doctors are part of your organization rights or a\nBig part I mean they're not only many of them are invested we are partially physician down a facility\nBut ah we have over two hundred and fifty credential physicians we have medical executive committees that encourage their ... our participation we keep our doors open each and every day I have a great a medical team\nTom cameras are medical director or an angel occurrences or chief nursing officer that work each and every day\nTo make sure that we're hearing what the needs of our physicians and those patients really are\nAnd how much credit to give all those folks for hiring the right people in the very beginning in ... who you hire that makes a huge difference too right\nYeah I think that there are people are absolutely our greatest assets and I think that add being working with him for twenty five years that day he places a lot of value on that and it's easy to become a leader in our organization knowing that you're supported by a guy that would spend more than a dollar because it's the right thing not because he has to\nWrite and you know it when I as a side note Steve when I think about ... the one thing that I also see I Am in touch with your organization I Am the nose the sky that you're going to find out of the you know what he does he go above and beyond a call and things he does for his staff his entire staff\nI mean outside of the work environment I mean it's really amazing just a ... or there's almost like a family environment there would you not\nFully agree I mean culture is so important to any organization and I really think that he hits a it comes very second nature to him because he knows that we can do what we do without having people truly invested in our company\nAnd he wants them to stay and he and he treats them it's just how he treats them so you got it in my assessment as you probably got the easiest job that's they're\nOh it's ... I really do think the easiest\nWay you're the chief operating officer of the other of diamond facility in a community that everybody loves I read about that before the show so young and don't look at me and a wizard and the and the tired I look at look at this guy over here he's running this facility\nAnd and he looks great he looks stress free and I understand why because things are going just\nExactly as you guys probably planned it from the very beginning\nEvery day is a little bit unique in its own right not everything goes the way we wanted to but we have a great team of people here are harder\nTo do these days I mean it ... insurance and all this kind of stuff I mean healthcare side easier in reimbursements aren't easy\nEither I mean are we say I don't think any businesses easy but I think that health care you're answerable to the government because they are part of the payment system you're answerable to the insurance companies because they're paying you\nYour answerable to your physicians and your patients and your vendors that supply you products I mean it's really different than the mechanics of any other business is just a lot more regulation that goes into\nWrites in a lot of the reimbursements just haven't changed haven't been up over the years either I mean I got to do a lot more with less well you know and you also brought with you Cheryl gummy know did I say that right Steve then I hit a rights\nIs ah actually ... going good how you named going on you know it looks like it should\nBe given me now to me but er doom at All right All right I'm going to call you Sheryl you're director of radiology services anything about you your name and your title are difficult for me to say here tonight what exactly do you do now\nBut south would show I'm the director of imaging that includes our imaging center\nThat's the new center that I see like when I'm right there by the debartolo building and look across the street right\nYes that's correct but we also have outlining areas that we cover imaging as well we have a heart center which we do stress tests and echo cardio grams\nSee now I didn't know about that now is that in the building by\nIt's in the delta behind us and the two fifty depart little place building\nOr talk talk a little bit about that because I wasn't aware of that\nOkay we uh we offer full cardiology practice there and we offer imogene services so you can have your echo Carter Graham test there and also your stress tests in addition to other cardiac cardiology services there they do pacemaker shacks and you can visit with cardiologist they're\nAll right so that's something that I didn't know that's behind the imaging center that's correct All right and what else oh do you have there are\nAlso in the hospital we had imaging to we have a full CAT scan machine an x-ray machine an ultrasound there so\nYou have the traditional south towards building right\nExactly at the hospital yeah\nMhm and then tell me about the separate facility that I always at a press a facility that I see what I'm sitting up at like thinking about running it\nWere ... and a gene radiology service we had a PET scans we\nHad cat scans we have ultrasound X ray mammography\nUm we offer general X ray world than I'm six days a week we offer extended hours on Monday and Tuesday for convenience if patients come in just seven pm at night mhm or open on Saturdays he could schedule appointments on Saturday as well you don't have to take off work\nOr people or people becoming particularly with through you know this last day of breast cancer awareness and they are ah sometimes I think that it has um I think I don't want to see women have a fear of it but some of them I think it's going to be uncomfortable or discomfort to can you talk a little bit about that\nYes I'm a lot of women do think that it's uncomfortable and it's not pleasant as we make it as pleasant as possible but having a mammogram as you can imagine not being too graphic you know could be\nPerceived actually ran into the lobby of one of your employees at work here that was recently a patient Mars itself was far and mammogram and she went on and on and explain how the process work\nI'm self the float perfectly she's scheduled she didn't have to wait she was on a calming environment and that's where we start the experience at the time when you enter the building it's very calming and she said I Can't believe it didn't hurt\nAnd I said I think it's a combination and the environment and our technique our staff and our equipment that makes that experience right at\nBut it's becoming a you know like we call ask me so he said they used to say well you didn't need to start the till you're fifty now they're starting to see forty our mammograms or we drop any age on that in your opinion that we should start them a little bit earlier to catch things earlier\nIt's recommended that women have it between the age of forty and forty four but at the age of forty five you should have it every year at the age of forty five\n... and ... and every year as what you say so if you get\nYou know if you get a clean reading one year you can say well Kevin wait three years from now to see what happens 'cause you just don't know where we're recommending every year in what's your background and all this are you surprised the advances that we made over the years that if you catch something early\nI mean it really is it really is about living basically I mean if you if you go to these tests are the older I got the more I'm convinced you know or whatever the test is uh bring it up because if you catch stuff early this is about living and dying in a lot of cases in your odds of living are much better\nYou know if you have this done not a ... if you get stuff sooner is what I'm trying to say\nAbsolutely October the busy month for us it's a busy months are going to hear that actually\nDid I'm close to a thousand milligrams this month\nAnd it's nice to know that we touched a thousand women and got them closer to either a clear report or an early detection so we were very proud of that\nUh we pride ourselves on providing services within the building everything's there within one building so we can give you a quick or diagnosis and get you on a path um to recover\nYou know what I find I Wish I could remember her name I met her on this broadcast on all of his last week a week before\nBut there's a there's a like a nurse coordinator yeah actually now this was a cool concept I've never heard of this you know what I mean I've never heard of this talk a little bit I was so impressed with that woman and what what her job is is basically\nTo you know when you go to a facility a lot of times it's just kind of you're ... you're sitting there and you know you're thinking about what the what it's all about to take place but she's kind of like your\nNurse navigator as you well yeah but kind of like your her a companion if you will but obviously through the system talk a little bit about that I was really impressed by her and what she does\nThat's on our end her name is Daryl more she's our nurse navigator\nAnd she handles all of our press patient and she basically like you said in layman's terms she walks you through the process so there's no question about what is next what's my next step she communicates with the patient from the time sometimes from the time of screening if you don't have a prescription or if you\nNeed assistance you have questions they'll walk you through that\nTo an ultrasound to the next step if you need a biopsy they go over the resolved with you and she works in close affiliation with the physicians as well so the physician will say this is what you're you know you can speak to my patient and tell them these resolved so she had good relationships with the physicians as well as the patient so they get collaborate for your\nRight but I mean should be there to say well everyone came back and everything's fine and you can be on your way or if there is something in question in and you're thinking about that that weighs on your mind she's there to say well this is what that means and this is what we do next and this is what it could be and what it couldn't be just basically got a Point New window where where you're going to go to next\nYes you have so much anxiety and things I'm\nGone promoter of anxiety I Want you to know that show\nAnd these women do have a lot of anxiety of worrying about what his next we try to alleviate that anxiety by giving you the nurse navigator tool to assist you through the process so I think ... is detrimental to your um care so we we try to take out a way\nOne in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime that means one out of every eight females we know could be at risk but I mean so and I do notice that I mean the sooner we catch that the better it is to survive ability rate\nA writes Nell let's talk

data\nBack with with\nTime I do these ah south woods or broadcast every single time\nAnd I do these every other ones say I get I get done and I think about and I'm Serious I don't just says because you think of how impressed I Am with everyone I've met from that facility and here and some of the stuff that I never even have heard about in your in hospitals or other facilities that they just don't do\nAnd then and then when when I when I hear all that like you know the nurse a guide you through this process\nSo this or just the general attitude or how it's all patient driven and that kind of stuff\nAnd I'm thinking to myself hospitals still don't do that to this day I mean you know and and and this facility which are quite frankly what you're not agree that we're lucky to have it in our community absolutely I mean I really think that we are genuinely lucky that it's here\nAnd and I and when people probably talk to their relatives and that kinda stuff do we attract people Steve from yeah from Cleveland Akron and other communities would say well I've heard about this and they come here\nWe do we've been around for about twenty two years now and we appreciate the opportunity just to come and talk about what we do and that the dedication of our staff or I think it helps educate the community and as we see patients are becoming more informed about their health care choices and we want to be a part of that so\nUm we are there are two large academic centers one in Pittsburgh and one in um Cleveland that with patients that are undergoing very complex medical treatment or in those two cities that they're actually referring their patients to us for our diagnostic imaging studies we had\nPatients that have come in for you know pet studies which goes along with the treatment of cancer we've had patients that have come in for a advanced them arise to to check on neurological conditions I mean\nWhen you look at it it's quite a a responsibility we have\nA major accomplishment for you since you've been there to see when you could have a a a facility that had would have beds that people could stay at instead of having to go to the hospital\nIt was great I always said that we kind of understood our business at that point in time being an outpatient surgery center but our doctors kept on coming back and said hey if you can do what you're doing on the outpatient side and do it on the inpatient side that would be one of the best things for us personally and will be one of the best things for our patients since we do it differently we do a better\nHow many ... have in the facility\nWe have a twenty four I impatient bets I'm so we can see a you know anybody from a total knee or total hip replacement through a a lumbar spine fusion cervical spine fusion to a mastectomy is calling receptions there's just about anything you can do\nAre there are times when you kinda wish maybe or for expansion of more than twenty four beds because or is that all the scheduling\nSo we get asked that question all the time and I think that as our history has shown that um you know we want to continue to evolve and serve the needs of the community and I think that uh I don't know what the future is going to bring I never would have thought a twenty two years ago we would have an acute care hospital\nI might visionary though Steve I I'm going to tell you I think I'm I'm visionary I can see this facility growing as far as inpatient bets are concerned and expanding as to what you can be done in patient therefore absolutely think I I'm a limited\nEdition or because I see your rate on it because when you look at a convenient access\nIs very important so when you look at our current set up we don't have an emergency room you know we do scheduled surgical procedures that the main campus you know as a\nUm as most of our business so we are looking at things that can both the increase access for ... through an emergency room or looking at uh the possibility of medical beds\nYou never know what today or tomorrow it's going to bring in the ... mind so we tried to keep up\nWith it and I think some of that is quite frankly by popular demand for lack of something else don't you think you're I don't you get a lot of feedback gas well do you do this or you're going to do this or something like that just from patients who've been there to have other stuff done\nYeah our patients really kind of died is you know I think that we look at things what ... what is not going to make us the next dollar it's what is going to help us improve service to our community and I think that that's how we went from out patient inpatient surgery that's how we got involved with diagnostic imaging\nAnd sleep testing so it is very much you know how do we serve that community\nYou know one of the things that ... ... my ... I don't I don't think it's a small thing I think it's kind of a cool thing like if you're if you're there visiting somebody and you're hungry they'll feed you did you know that Steve\nI didn't know that you know and that well I mean\nWhen you think about how cool it is did you ever see that ever happened in a hospital\nI don't think that that's ever happened I think that uh the take home meals you know that was something that ed at the very beginning of the impatience I'd said hey I don't want our patients that have to worry about where their first meal is going to come from so I Want to make it simple so when they leave feed them feed their you know\nBut I Am here if you're the you know a husband or wife they're worried about the personal ended up that they you know the more than the patient is what I'm saying\nAbsolutely it's a little bit late\nStrangers every night around seven o'clock because I'm hungry\nWe'd noted that we noticed that you like the state in the same thing on the other thing but we're glad to serve you there or if you're right I mean I think healthcare recover from a procedure as a family uh activity and we try to take care of everybody in that equation de ...\nDe ... the year in charge but do you realize how innovative that is I mean I I how good of an idea that is that's never been done\nAgain Ron it seems like it comes back to the human element you know that's what we're focused on I think that as we've always said it's just not about the treatment but how you're treated that really are worn out of okay what are the needs of our patients can we anticipate that and we have", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "31"}
