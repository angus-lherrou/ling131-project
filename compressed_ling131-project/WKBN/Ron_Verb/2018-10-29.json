into and for whatever reason you know right away it always goes back to the Trump I mean everything if you if you watch these networks everything is about Trump and how he's\nHow we ... you know behind all this kind of stuff and I just as quite frankly folks I just had enough of it I just absolutely had enough and I'm thinking to myself really\nGuy just uh went off the deep end for whatever reason you know he's in the same moral human eye area and a and we don't go out and do this kind of stuff can't we just accept that there are people that are just a little bit crazy a little bit nuts mentally unstable and they do some stuff that normal people hopefully like all of us wouldn't do\nThat not everything on God's green earth that happens is the fault of President Trump\nYou know but you have all of these people well let's how Trump talks about you know it's because Trump talks about the illegals in because Trump or says you know that's basically because Trump is saying we're going to stop the illegals and there's one way to come into this country the legal way I guess\nThat makes you just an awful person today I guess I I guess you're a terrible human being because you say stuff like that gee I think if you want to come to the United states of America you should come here legally and through our process you shouldn't come here illegally where we don't know enough about you and who's coming in and all this kind of jazz\nSo this this this somehow is just an awful thing to be saying which for the life of me I can understand why and because this guy just flipped out on apparently you know the on illegals and um\nAnd some connection with the Jews are it's just not it's absolutely nutty but you know you listen to these people and it's everything is Trump's fault this assault Trump's fault\nUh this is all his fault just like with a pipe bombs that you know you have another guy that's obviously got a screw loose you know you just can't accept the fact that you have people that are have some mental problems\nAnd she got another guy that send these pipe bombs on that's all Trump's fault you know it's all his fault you know his rhetoric his speech\nAnd I'm just telling you it's just so ridiculous I mean everything of course on the majority and networks if it wasn't for Fox it'd be on all the networks everything that happens is Trump's fault everything that happens negative or somebody does is now Trump's fault\nBecause of uh how we speak so his attitude on stuff\nAnd I and I'm just so\nUm [noise]\nIt's so that this stretch for me is just ridiculous\nIt's just ridiculous when I hear well let's let's let's get a bit iffy blonde and they want to do things for political purposes or whatever purposes and make everything Trump's fault instead of saying hey this guy's nuts and what he did was a ... thing and you know who's to blame for it he is to blame for it no one else he did its\nHe'll stand trial for its and he'll be sentenced accordingly just like the guy that set out the pythons are we supposed to cater are dialogue in this country to the to the people that might have a mental illness or might flip out are we supposed to all walk on eggshells\nAre because of that apparently that's what some people think\nBut I sure don't agree with that and I'll never agree with that\nSo so is this was going on yet this is the first time I've ever I just said enough I just totally shut the TV off I had enough of it all I had enough of the political commercials I had enough of the the people making this right off of the pipe bomb thing and you know ... the same thing it's always Trump's fault\nI just shut it off I just couldn't literally I didn't even want to hear it anymore didn't want to take it didn't want to hear it\nAnd I thought this is a sad damn day in America\nThat we don't have a media that's that that understands at an individual is held accountable for their behavior and their actions not\nWhat Obama not what Clinton that what Bush not what Trump says that particular individual there is no one else I mean they make that decision arrest and it's like what are these people expect we're just supposed to just touch cater our language to them most\nThe unstable people and the ... the the other thing that I hear when they're talking about this dialogue is you know why can't we all just get along it's another thing that I find annoying and I'm going to tell you we can all just get along because the philosophies are so damn difference because you have a one party that believes in more socialism more taxes more governments\nI'm a whole different direction than the other party that believes in lower taxes and capitalism I mean the differences are so huge\nBetween these parties now we just can all get along because I certainly don't agree with any of those philosophies even a philosophy the whereas an American I should say well can't we all say when it comes to the border you should come here legally\nInto this country not illegally not in a caravan storming the border and it's kind of stuff I mean what you think as Americans we can agree\nOn that but we cannot\nSo it was just enough I just reached a point where where where it's enough and I'm probably going to be at that point for quite some time you know at at just had quite some time uh\nThan some of the political commercials just have had enough of them justice absolutely have had enough of them just sick of it um comments seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven\nSeven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven will get you through it I mean I mean I literally I and I can't imagine\nYou know returning to any of that kinda stuff whether that's a the today show whether that's the CBS morning show a or any of them I just I just said a but for what it's worth I said I don't want to hear it\nAnd ah I'm sick and damned tired of it\nI'm sick and tired of everything being Trump's fault I'm sick and tired of thinking everybody thinks we should just get along and everything which I think is nonsense we're not going to get along I mean for for crying out loud there isn't much with the Democratic party I agree with that all\nIn our ... how do you expect you know and they and their we can't get an agreement on simple issues like coming out of the country illegally I mean you've got a party of things people should be able to just come on in here in a legal should be able to vote\nHow do you ever going to rectify that I mean you have a party that just says we should just start given money away you know two people basic income just bright people checks for five hundred bucks put money away for kids as they grow up ... common sense on where the money comes from we're just going to turn into social so start giving everybody money\nHow do you ever expect\nPeople to come to a conclusion or ... or an agreement on this kind of stuff it's just not going to happen sure as hell isn't gonna happen with me\nAnd like I said you got you got bite and talk and we need more civility in politics he was never seeing that though when you had the Democrats you know Hillary Clinton saying you can't be civil to these people he was ever saying that when you had the ... guy see you know the former attorney general you know when the when they go low you kick him\nOr getting their face in the restaurants and all this other language you know are biting send boy I'd like to be Trump up for all this other languages never set it then\nSince I saw I Am so tired of the double standard I'm so tired of the everything's Trump's fault I'm so tired of the nonsense of civility because it's the differences are so far apart there is nothing about the Democratic party I can supports\nSeven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven a gene hello there\nYeah Ron I'm I'm a longtime listener there's many things I disagreed with you on but I've got one question for you today and I'm hoping for the rest of the afternoon and this man guilty absolutely and my question is why can't we put him to death\nAnd a couple of years ago my son was watching a movie where they were actually putting it ... it was a futuristic movie where what is guiding yet and letting it down in the city in the country and watch\nIf we would put one for him to death and let people watching it would cut down on the crime\nNo you know and let me let me give you two things on that first of all most people who commit a crime don't think they're going to get caught I mean you know they know if they get caught they are going to go to jail for life or potentially be put to death they think they're going to get away with it so I don't know all\nRight I just hang on a second so I don't know if it's a big deterrent I'm not opposed to him being put a\nPut to death I mean they got um red handed\nWhat troubles me more than what you're saying is I don't want to spend millions of dollars with psychiatrist on the guy in in in in in all of this kind of money to convict a guy that's been caught red handed I think it shouldn't be a swift trial and if he faces the death penalty than it should be swift as well I realize on a death penalty case you get an automatic appeal\nBut you you wait and see the millions of dollars we taxpayers are going to spend\nOn a guy that clearly was caught red handed and we shouldn't have to do that I think it's under stupidity I think the trial should be quick in Manhattan to death for them to death\nAnd let's get and let's get on with it I don't need it to be on television just put 'em to death and let's get nothing but\nIn any of that ilk he was caught red handed he's got twenty people and saw him right out and if you kill somebody like that and go oh shit I go on\nThe line or don't swear don't you know use the word you can't talk like that here\nNow your ears the reality you what do I I ... listen I agree it should happen very quickly I don't know if ten days listen I'm all for the process here's your trial that she moved very quickly here's your appeal that should be moved very quickly\nReminding a murderer is now on the ... are radiolab

mentally disturbed because I'm not about to do something like that because so we can actually say what is on her thoughts on on our minds we have too many consult driven politicians now that speak so eloquently and saying nothing\nThat are given these buzz words from consultants and they really do nothing they say nothing and might make you feel better but nothing but there is no results as a as a result of it\nI Am not going to do that I'm going to hold individuals accountable for their behavior docket it all starts right there that's why shut it off all morning long everything's Trump's fault and I'm just sick of it\nAnd I think the only solution is have ... because the nut cases\nAnd they're now that you don't even know a lot of time in ... the only thing you can do is look action you cannot make this call me you can not your weight yet I don't do what you have got to have affection\nYou know you can only have so much of that and what you can afford as well not going to find a way

a certain amount of uh of of of\nScout there but there's a yeah I guess you're missing my point I'm not talking about necessarily somebody mentally disturbed with the with the hatred like a ... it's just bizarre to even understand\nBut I mean it's it's the fact that it's like you said I guess I got the memo everything is Trump's fault and I just think that's nonsense but that's all I was hearing is oh it alls Trump's fault everything's Trump's altogether bombs is Trump's fault disguise Trump's fault everything's Trump's fall\nWithin their head and ... let's see if they can get some traction

I resent these type of comments even when you were saying well that's what they want to imply I don't care what they want to imply the reality is a lot of people voted for Trump I'm happy with the job he's doing and I think these people that are making any of these things I just shut it off\nAnd they go to some kind of big trial they're going to drive a lot of those poor people in their case the fire trials thing ...\nAreas Ryan it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it's absolutely a gigantic ... up to them right it's a waste of money in a waste of time I'm In total agreement with you\nYeah I'm In complete agreement but thank you for your call on word news radio find Seventy nobody ... says well shy of for news radio find somebody that can be on guard with your comments\nI I guess it's worth what you're saying is that they follow it through if any case like this it's a horrendous situation a what we really ought to do is not impaneled a jury or or anything of that nature we get a couple\nA radio talk show hosts and get them to say look we can wave a trial and this will just invalidate the constitution and not worry about due process and interest execute\nWell that is not what I'm saying and let me clarify for you exactly what I Am saying since you didn't understand what I'm saying what I'm saying well as you're not you know I just I Know I just want to I Want to clarify because obviously you're not understanding and\nObviously the guy did it we caught I'm right handed yes you can and panel or you're going to go through the process of a jury trial he was caught red handed it should move quite quickly and move very quickly because obviously he did it and then if you want to seek the death penalty is you know as an attorney it's an automatic appeal\nDepending if they see that and then he gets his automatic appeal and he goes through that process again and I think you should be able to do that since you caught I'm right handed certainly within six months to remove the system along so justice can prevail that's what I'm saying to you I'm not saying that we just put them in the gallows and execute him I'm saying we follow this process but the process\nTakes too long they shouldn't take ten well why don't you take your millions of dollars and\nSubmitted a two to Mr Simon to take down to Columbus for you because under the law now you just can't do things that quickly unfair\n... the problem why can't you do it that well why don't you have is out now let me ask you why or why don't you don't have as a child and and all I wanted a new hasn't bugging me ask you a question stop why can't you\nHave a speedy trial we caught the guy red handed and why can't you get to get it done work but I mean he's read hand how much do you want to spend and how long do you think it should take\nOut well take a loan on what the average is on a murder case\nWell what is is that I Want to witnesses\nThat doesn't mean you don't have a right to due process it takes time for preparation you know it it it just\nTotally walk into court and like try ration we caught him red handed to you that you are okay but the system caught him red handed we know he did it he's guilty but okay\nSo I mean how much we don't know what we don't know what the ... who cares what the facts are well never mind on the order of ... right\nHe's a murderer Herbert you murdered a bunch of people was actually right do you think he should get life in prison or face the death penalty you wanted it to get away with that yes the facts are wrong you don't want to concern yourself or that the one I wanted my inaccurate to say to you that he killed a bunch of people is that was actually accurate yes I'd\nSay it appears to be the truth yeah\nOK so based on that do you think he should be do life in prison and or be put to death absolutely All right do you think that we should be able to in a society get that done and a half a year that I don't\nI don't know about that you know I really do allow look you know you have a simplistic efforts to with everything well this is pretty simple\nAre saying that if we send somebody down to Columbus ah who's a Republican they can do more\nThan a Democrat and yes because the legislature\nIs run by all Republicans\nI'm saying to you that I think not only is added benefit I'm thinking his basic um style will accomplish more basic on al\n... and maybe a cage in the in the back room actors\nFor gas right she hasn't done anything so let's get rid of her and try someone else and if he doesn't do anything then we'll get rid of him\nI ...

issue\nI I Can't support that at all I can just a force saying what's let's undo the ... the regulations and he caught or let's do the tax cuts when those are the sole responsibility as to why the economy's doing so well but this is the same group of people that made fun of\nA Trump when he got to a four point two percent of GDP and they said that will never happen that will never happen really\nIt's just a group of people who are too far entrenched and ingrained in their in their thought process and their decision making that they hate Trump Trump is Republican there for a much disagree with everyone\nDon't you think you're right you're parties\nIsn't that what's wrong isn't this about Americans as opposed to you're saying because they hate Trump I mean realistically how smart you have to be to say gee is the economy better yes she is a country bends pretty safe and I was ISIS pretty well\n... ... well on the run yeah I really think they are gee is there a big problem with people who don't believe in borders yeah there really are in a caravan come and thinking they'll get into this country yeah there is\nYou know I I don't know what more you once you aren't you glad deals got negotiated in our best interest instead of screwing us\nNow let's get some president that says nothing with political consultants and great talk about accomplishes nothing yeah that's what I'm going to vote for really the ... the saddest vote that I'm going to have to deal with is the vote for governor of Ohio because really I don't care for either one of the choices\nTo be blunt with you I I you know in all seriousness I'd rather just uh I I don't like either one of my choices for governor\nRomney asked the question what do you think's going to happen when uh all these four thousand migrants show up on the order ratings Trump's going to do\nI have no clue I mean I think uh I think that he's going to have a military presence and I have no no clue\nWhat's going to happen um whatsoever and I and I think that it's some I think it's an organized efforts obviously somebody organized it I don't think seven thousand or plus people decided one day to walk to America it was an organized effort suits has funded by someone I think in his political motivations\nAnd I would certainly also majority of people in America would support the president that says there's one way to come to this country and that's legally\nNot this nonsense that's going on it's being organized for whatever purpose it is I really do think that we are people that are out ... to ... I don't know if it's destroy America because they don't\nThey believe in socialism not capitalism I'm very troubled by some of the people that are seeking power with basic income with let's give kids a sixty thousand dollars some of the stuff I'm hearing I find so so bizarre and troubling I could never support that party never could never will won't do it\nMaybe it's just a product of our own success in our country that all these people are just living in such isolated bottles they just think that um the rest of the world is just like their bubble and the real world\nIsn't out there and see my message doesn't play very well with people when I look at an able bodied person and you know it is a touchy feely when I look at an able bodied person and say in many cases people need a good kicking the S. C. that isn't that that doesn't make you feel good when I look at you and say let's take a look at the decisions you may did you graduate high school\nDid you ... can you pass a drug test did you decide to learn a skill or trade and vocational school when you were in high school or when you got out of school did you go to college to get a degree in something that matters\nYou know I mean because all I'm doing is putting it back on them do you have a work ethic will you show up every day I mean see I'm just putting it right back on them it's not a touchy feel good message but it's the same message that I use in raising my own children\nThat I Would recommend you use and raising your children that there is personal responsibility there's the value of a dollar there's a work ethic and responsibility for your actions\nAnd that's what I Believe in I don't believe in a touchy feel thing we should take care of everybody who makes a stupid decision I Believe that's what family is for I Believe that's what's charity is for I Believe that's what church is for I don't believe in bigger government and higher taxes I Believe in better smaller government lower taxes more efficient governments\nAnd we are going in the opposite direction I Believe you are having too much of your money taken away from you period and they play on your ignorance\nWell you know hard work and are working for a job is exactly what Mexico offered all these migrants that ... yeah\nBut they don't want it because they were obviously paid and they have a goal in mind I just can't wait to see how that all laid out I Know a farmer or locally who is higher um some legal I'm a southern workers and flat out ask them\nWhy what makes your work ethic that much better than people who live here now like you guys are genetically different and they just flat out say where we're from you don't work you don't eat that's why they work hard\nIt's telling that in that's used to be how this country was but we've made it so with all of the safety nets we made its you know we haven't made their consequences to it\nAnd you know now we have of course Tim Ryan saying there should be free college we have these people talking about basic income will give away eight kids ... you know is Cory Booker and whatever thing here you get at fifty or sixty thousand dollars by the time you're Eighteen\nI'm listening to this and I'm and I'm looking at these people thinking hey they're buying votes and B you're destroying the country they're the enemy within the quote Michael Savage they genuinely are\nAnd I ... and ... and we're never going to get along on this type of thing the civility Joe Biden says I Can't support that and I never will\nIt surely is an enemy within I Can't say a better term to describe it um it's slowly slowly eating away at it like when you're sick with a virus\nYou know it each yet in Egypt so much but at the end if they if the virus when you die so does the virus everything goes and unfortunately I see that our country going that way that eventually you learn how to take over and the people who are supporting them can't keep up we've been pushing they're buggy

I think you'll enjoy what we have going on here that stadium GM All right so unfortunately I was informed that the guy that and I would like them to call back was going to tell me everything Obama did as far as jobs were here\nHe was initially started to talk about the bailouts of General Motors which as I was trying to say to him before he a party company and I apologize 'cause we have our long breaks here are scheduled commercial breaks we have to take on time\nAnd to the point I was going to make it to him was that the treasury secretary seamless pulse and he was under George W Bush if you want to go back on his GM thing it was under George Bush who called candidate Obama and I thought it was John McCain that he was running against but it was Obama\n[noise] to the White House and George Bush did and said called both of them running for president to the White House and basically said to them\nYou know things are melting down what happened was you know basically credit was frozen and forward that need a credit line it already got it in a private market and what have you but General Motors was hanging out there but anyway uh needless to say he called both of them\nTo the White House and said uh about the bailout which he did starts\nA good or bad you know some people think it was bad\nA heated start that with the bailout of General Motors\nAnd ah of course he was nearing the end of his presidency and it was continued on under Obama some people think that's a good thing some people think that's a bad thing so uh you know credit or blame can go to both the Bush and Obama\nOne way or the other course bushels leaving office at that particular time of the argument that they made you might remember his it's too big to let it fail it affects the the supply lines if you know if we let it fail and the supply lines that also supply for it and also some like rice or will be a greatly affected as well as a large number\nOf people in in the area\nYou know if you'd asked me do I think that would happen again today I Would say the odds of that or fifty fifty because many people are don't view that as a something that should never happen again\nKeeping in mind incidentally is that guy was talking about uh about Obama new jobs it was none other than a guy named Corker and I forget the other guy that said General Motors is going to have to change we're not going to give\nGive them money and they continue the same model is if you will when you're talking about saving General Motors if you remember Pontiac is now gone many things that General Motors had no longer exist because they said it needed to be more like a Toyota model as far as the company itself going in that direction and I very much was a Republican\nOr if you will mandate on all this from particularly a guy named Corker who I Believe is leaving a his position a I think he's a center if I'm not mistaken our congressman\nBut anyway that would be my um\nThoughts about you and Obama and all these jobs and that kinda stuff so I you know when you when you want to talk about that I think quite frankly if you want to talk about large sun I really think that Trump is doing the most for\nAny of the car manufacturers and I think deep down most of these guys will vote for Trump or or or support from because they realize he's the first guy to do anything about the deal it was a crushing blow to their industry first of all is the first guy that called all these executives to the White House face to face\nYeah I agree with you on everything I agree completely on everything you say\nAnd every you know the last couple of weeks I've been listening to you and I can hear your frustration and Everytime I hear you it takes me back twelve Thirteen fourteen years ago when Obama was running for office originally and when I heard him speak and I bought the transformation of America it was concerned and you and I had many debates\nAll ... debates I remember I remember him very well you know I Do\nYou know and I was really worried when I heard the guy he can and all this stuff and and I hate to say it but you know I think that was correct on just about every issue\nOh I think you weren't too I I make no bones in saying that I think I think you were absolutely absolutely correct and I and I I Am concerned and I would ask you this question because you had that vision I'm even more concerned with where the Democratic party is heading now with the Bernie Sanders it seems it's even going further to the left and further to socialism\nExactly and you know these these things transform over time they don't happen so when you look at an election when you look at an election you have to look forward in St okay if this person who's elected where we're going to be for eight ten twelve years down the road so back then I was worried I thought to myself you know this guy\nIt concerns me if if he gets a Congress that just rubber stamps\nA lot of his ideology\nPolicies now I'm scared I went from being concerned just scared if these Democrats getting off\nI don't know ... ... ... ... our children right explain why you are because I'm a I'm with you when I was watching Limbaugh get interviewed by Sean Hannity I agree with Limbaugh's comments\nYou know this is to vastly different directions for a country one is the one that made the country great which is capitalism and to individual spirit the other one is\nA bigger government more taxes more socialism and I think those are the two visions that are out there right now\nAh and puts it with the Democratic party being the socialism\nYeah and they keep going further left which is shocking because they're distancing themselves from people like you know when I was just it just shocks me\nWell don't ask you this I mean when you say that\nI I'm with you on that I mean I Can't imagine a party that has members who think if you're here illegally you should be able to vote or you are there shouldn't be borders are there shouldn't be ice or we should give a basic income five hundred thousand dollars to everybody or we should give we should give you your Cory Booker all these kids should get fifty or sixty thousand dollars when they're Eighteen years old\nWhen I'm here in this kind of stuff gets insanity to me it\nIs and I agree with you I don't know how anyone can vote Democrat and the people that are hard last I hate to say it because I Know some people are very well\nI just tell you guys are filled with hate over Trump and you can't get past it in your hatred grows by the days I mean your last caller was one of your previous callers mentioned that the rhetoric from what's out there and I agree with you I Wish he would tone it down however you know the campaign was one thing\nWhen he got elected they might not meddling waters Clinton shoulder what we can go on and on the things that these people say he responds to\nI wouldn't I wouldn't just let it go\nBut I'm not going to hold a guy down for fighting back and that's what they're doing is Democrats I mean why the Democrats don't call out Maxine Waters why don't they call out Eric Holder CNN if they they put all this junk out there about Trump but they don't you know they don't\nHold the Democrats accountable and I think about Hillary Clinton's interview I saw on CNN where she said that there can be no civil rest\nOf the real living rooms or I don't know civility until they're out of office what does that mean you weren't that promote you\nRight now I'm In total agreement and then you know Joe Biden saying we need more civility in politics but he never said that about a new statements that Eric Holder made or Hillary Clinton made or\nOr anything along those lines but let me ask you a question how do you have why can't we all just get along mentality when divisions are so dramatically different I mean I I I there's no way I can agree with any of those\nUm directions the Democrats want to go in I don't agree with any of that stuff any of it\nI I agree and I'm with you I don't either but they made it that they're facing that no matter what Republicans try to work with them on they won't even come to the table because it's gotta be\nWriting far down here where there's no more compromise or we meet in the middle\nAnd got older and I ... and there's there can't be so dramatically different I I don't want compromise on a lot of these issues but I Would I Would say this to you\nA like a just stated I I really think that when it comes to health care I don't think there is a solution I don't think I I basically am getting more and more convinced as time goes on Obamacare is here to stay and that's just the way it's going to be and uh I don't know what the cost of healthcare is going to be five years from now it's ... or ... I agree\nWith you that it's here to stay and that's one of the big reasons I was so against him\nUh you know just think if we can go back how many years has it been ten twelve years to the way insurance used to be wouldn't that be great\n[noise] some people would say yes as some people would say yes and some people say no they have a pre existing condition so it's hard to say thank you good

you know my call and has never got a chance to tell you about all the jobs are that ... ... if if I'm remembering right now maybe I'm wrong the jobs that were being created back then okay what part time jobs right\nBut like I I must admit that people will call me said hey you know with Obamacare that you get healthcare after thirty hours suggest what the employers are just dropping down to twenty nine as opposed to when it was forty and he worked in thirty eight they were absolutely correct so yeah you're you're correct\nYou know and so then you have somebody who possibly had to get two part time jobs so they can afford\nNow if they can be normal and snap ... for some reason just like you see a time and time again within an employer fire somebody and they come back and kill a boss or killer fellow employees\nThey just snap or somebody gets divorced and they stamping they do something like that so I'm not saying that normal people don't get something that can snap\nBut you know you got people that are mentally unstable and it's like these people are trying to say well Trump should cater his his uh rhetoric to the mentally unstable you know in a in ... when he talks about how you have been some of these people coming to the refugees are bad people and\nUh but it's splitting in the ground and the criminals and we can't let 'em in the country illegally and what have you ah as a ... you know which is simple is Trump's basic argument is smart there is one way to come to this country and that's legally and you can't come as a mob and think you're going to get into the country that's basically what he's saying so\nWithout being ... with that being said that you know they're just going on again of course everything is Trump's fault when I when when I watch television but it's but it was just like all of this so it's him he used to blame and I'm just white and I just said I've had enough of that\nThat just literally just shut it off I thought this is ridiculous hold the person who did it accountable for their actions are in ... in\nWithout with the exception of Fox News everything is Trump's fault and the rest of the media and it's unbelievable to me\nIt's just unbelievable so we should all take some calls on that seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven that's kind of what we're talking about that and other issues

sixty nine Ninety five year old man either on you try to keep it\nSimple that's the problem I mean we're not simple things you want to keep it simple\nSometimes is black and white sometimes there's great\nLet me ask you a question oh go ahead seriously don't you think it's relatively simple the guy that did the shooting in Pittsburgh we caught him right handed so we know he did it\nThat's pretty simple and I when when I said now as we should be able to have the ... process that exist now and get it done in six months if we sentence him to death there's an automatic appeal we should be able to get through this\nIn six months and convict him whether that's life in prison where sentence him to death we know he did it it shouldn't cost the taxpayers millions of dollars now he wants to follow me because that's simple\nWell if there was a cartoon character Carrick sure he said would have been a person going you know\nI mean they just keep it simple ... cats I mean it's just it's so easy and white and just white is right and wrong is wrong well right I don't think\nForgiveness is the best thing that risk for getting this is a great thing there is an oil\nWell you you know one day and I and I'm all for that in\nCertain situations not in a situation where somebody opens up and just guns people down I have no forgiveness for that I Believe in justice in\n... and all that I have no no\nI'm not talking about the guy that shot\nYeah I mean we're really not into my body that out and got a call ... know that the law is not what he speaks up you know what I say\nHere's here's where I agree with you when you're talking about forgiveness\nI think we've gone beyond that 'cause you know let's say like I say Kathy Griffin met with a separate Trump had\nBad jokes she apologized she got fired Roseanne Barr bad joke she got fired she apologized and she got fired\nNow we have Megan Kelly statements that are that ah she sincerely apologize for and she got fired\nThere is no forgiveness on these minor things that people are doing that are just words they're not opening fire or anything like that and they're getting fired as a result of it I find that very troubling particularly when he's people apologize I think\nIf if you learn and you apologize that we should accept it and move on and people grow as a result of that but not in a lot of this anymore up you're automatically fired I don't agree with that that's where I live in for I don't either\nDoesn't make any sense making Kelly God\nGuy in a raw deal he went over there and get the I'll never forget the Trump first came out in that debate would fix the Republicans and the first thing she did she went and writes for the juggler\nLike a rat or outlying go for the juggler and he gets lap and you know they ... only Rosie O'Donnell and I said oh my God somebody knows how to\nElect the Arabs I don't know what is it about this president but Ron I'm telling you right now God God is power on this man I'm telling you I I'm

for yourself at our own new set of the art facility on route forty six see you at Toyota worn\nSo nothing and and and with Obama you would have had the TPP the Trans Pacific partnership in addition and nothing being done with NAFTA\nYou're you're absolutely correct you've actually you've asked a great question what was better under Obama the answer is nothing versus what the what what what's going on now I think things are much better now I don't understand for the last ... any\nSome of these people need to make it or not old enough or something\nWho did live on Jimmy Carter when we had the eight percent mortgage rate and you were Eighteen percent unemployment All right and then you understand you know how valuable and how good a good economy is\nRight well see and I'm Glad that you mentioned that this I Hope this guy's making a great point\nBecause because the Democrats are saying forget the economy and and I I'm with this guy a hundred percent with the point he's making you know I I Lived through the Jimmy Carter's time you know when people act like you forget the economy really let's talk about that are you better if you were laid off from your job\nOr you know archer kids better off down with a good economy so when they graduate high school or college they can find a job\nOr in a decent paying job and if they're not happy with that they can find another job aren't you pleased with the fact that we are right now we have a shortage of labor\nThat ... that that is that you can find a job your kids can find a job if you've got a lousy job you can leave it and get another job we have more jobs and we have people that are unemployed so aren't you pleased that were in that position and they want you to ignore that\nThe people on minimum wage have gotten raises and people got bonuses and the economy is soaring\nA and you're supposed to forget that I\nI could only take it Hillary Clinton won one she was going to shut down coal industry and ban fracking I Can't imagine what your electric bill your natural cast dealing in your gasoline for your choir would cost\nExactly and you wouldn't ... job so you would have to walk anywhere\nYou're exactly right you are one hundred percent rights\nYou know I I that's why I Am but I'm the I'm right in tune with this guy 'cause I'm thinking of people act like oh it's not just the economy and I'm thinking really\nWhat if you're laid off what if your what what if you lose your job what if your kids can't find a job and going to school you think that's another important thing\nThis is the same party that laughed at the guy who's got the growth at this level who did something about that I was just talking to a buddy of mine who says Trump has two hundred and fifty seven million or billion dollars worth of things and it probably million that he's willing to throw towards China\nAh as far as terrorists are concerned it's either a million or billion that he's got sitting there you know prior to the negotiations you know think about that you know as well as I Do he'll throw him down if China doesn't reach an agreement is more favorable to the United states China is a communist country they do dumping here\nI mean it's it's just unbelievable hypocrisy and then Hillary Clinton saying we can't be civil with the Republicans until we get power and then is blaming violence on Republicans I mean it's it's unreal I get it\nWell I happen to agree with your entire statements and I happen to agree with your conclusion as well and would you not agree that it's a party that seems to be going into a very socialistic direction on things you know basically saying that legal should be able to vote let's get rid of ice let's get rid of borders let's have basic income\nYes or no yeah yeah I mean would you agree I'm I don't know why I don't know what I'm hearing music but I'm hearing some music okay or who knows okay now I'm not hearing it would you agree with my comments or\nOh absolutely I mean it's becoming authoritarian anything you know that was a great thing about America's founding no we revolted against a authoritarian um dictatorships\nYou know the the royalty was authoritarian and that's what they want and you have all these politicians that have been in office for twenty plus years it's saying\nI don't think anybody should be in DC that long they're they're just automatically out of touch with the people if they've been in DC that law\nWell look at Tim Ryan I Would agree with that totally\nAny of the Republican Democrat doesn't matter twenty plus years you need to go I don't know if when you go from limits are these guys just need to say you know I've tried to do it I could I Need to go\nYeah I Would agree with that totally don't seek re election but it becomes their livelihood and no longer\nThere there are there more they become entrenched thank you for your call I got a pause will come back after this live in cities human versus where you'll find\nNow

now here say to a gym in Salem sorrows Tuesday should be an ideal they fifty it's going to be the high fifty will be below eighty percent chance of\nRain on Wednesday sixty four high forty eight furlough Seventy percent chance arraigned on Thursday fifty eight for thirty eight furloughs so rain is definitely\nIn our forecast and has been boy that's been I think we have the wettest September on record and uh now we're in October and it's been a wet October\n... at least is rain and it's not snow in but we're we're the same as somewhat like almost ten degrees below normal for October\nAnd so we'll see on November go so I always say it every year around this time if we can get through all of November before we have any significance though you know if you can get into through November and even into a large chunk of December you know if you can get through November and\nUh even down close to Christmas without any significance though then it makes for a much shorter\nA winner and everybody benefits you know from not having to spread a bunch of salt and ah\nThe expense and all that kind of stuff I was kind of hope for that as we get closer and closer to the particular months says you know a ... you know some people obviously well I don't I'd rather have clean roads and a easy driving them have to worry about a bunch of stone that kinda stuff\nSo hopefully that will remain the case I mean we've got John Arnold he's going to be coming up after the break it's Monday nights six to seven we have general with the financial show a news radio find somebody to what he can be an Sean Hannity at seven we're live at stadium Jim right here in the showroom be out here tonight till seven o'clock I remind you of\nThe great opportunity here to the gym\nAnd which is looking at a Buick concourse sitting right next to me you can purchase at twenty five percent off the purchase price for the spirit Concord or if you want to lease it zero down delivers here stadium GM you know Jim is Elise loyalty miss spirit Concord with zero down as one Seventy nine months\nYou know I remember the guy I don't know if you remember the ... back in the broadcast a while then I Want to bounce set off this off of you he once said to take a look at utilities if utilities are\nGoing up the rest of the market goes down because people are moving to utilities and vice versa if they're moving out of utilities have the rest of the market is going up have you looked at utilities is far from that perspective I say that 'cause they thought didn't Eighteenth you have a six percent evidence\nThey do and actually staying in the thirties are they still do it that's that's always my favorite stock to start someone out with as far as I'm like a new trader or new investment person a are near the market if they have no experience at all or if they're scared of risk but they want more than a CD\nAnd tell them listen here's a little like kind of an in between so it gives you a taste of the market\nWill get you again off the David and ah you know Internet and cell phones aren't going anywhere anywhere soon Eighteenth he happens to be the largest obviously carrier\nOf a sailor found so no it'd probably be getting that they went out of business but the can so I started out with the weather utility like ATM tea or even a horizon and catch a nice to have it in but Eighteen the right now it's a hell of a\nHell of a a David and six percent and if you're a dollar cost averaging ... or if you're somebody doesn't have a lot of money but once I get into that market that's a good one to start out with a if you're willing to take a little bit of risk\n... but I mean you know it's got a great dip it in in a in general are utilities doing well I I was I I haven't paid attention to it because remember what that guy said when it's going to utilities it's bad for the rest of the market and\nWell I I've actually ironically said that a couple of times or the Palestinians and that's why if you if you're a pull up our client accounts as a lump sum and um most of them have a need the effort called ... which is the utility each yeah\nAnd ... ironically for the past two years my my clients are asked me you know maybe we have too much maybe we should take over money out of utilities and put the rest of the stuff like Amazon Google\nAnd some other stuff and they said absolutely not because this was that we balanced the equation now everybody's loving the fact that we got to see them and you know because the other ones are taken a beating it's just you just never\nYou're never you're never for sure on anything in the stock market ever and uh that's and that's that [laughter] and like you pointed out utilities kind of help balance that equation now and then I agree with that but sometimes if you know I've seen it all sectors are down including utilities\nAnd no matter what you do like that that minus eight hundred and fifty point down the down two weeks ago\nEverything was down everything every sector every every every index so uh it's not it's not to save all to everything but it is a way to to a game against balance your portfolio with ... uh obviously ... or less beta stocks in Hunan next that\nCaptured evidence yeah the thing is with us make sense is everything I've seen shows that the earnings are doing quite well you know in a I mean is this just jitters as a result of interest rates going up or terrorists or China or what\nNone of that and and that and I'm Glad you brought that up because again it's it's a teaching moment for our clients of the show definitely the ... the listeners ship this is all ... this was all a power play by big\nBig money computer trading billionaires we're going to have probably the best commerce the best earnings season\nThe best Christmas slash holiday season we've ever had in in Christmas of two thousand Eighteen and my mom and my opinion this is an opinion we're setting up for what's called a bullish chemical\nAbbas ... is the same as like a slingshot treats for the project either before or the best it has to go back farther so the farther you were pulled back a a slingshot\nThe fat them the more forward it's going to that project caused them to go so in my opinion what's happening right now is the setting of her oldest cat so the best way to get him and make a lot of money on Amazon is to pull it back right the best way to make money on an equal is to pull a pack so when it springs forward you bought it at all well\nSo back to my zero sum game\nIf you can get investors to release the volume on Amazon and decrease in decrease that share price by what it has which has never in the mouth and you get to buy that ant by an before the Santa Claus rally comes in and before or news comes on Amazon and and these other things that I Would tell we've tied to it or just the market in general\nYou're going to make one hell of a game where they're counting on as if subconsciously and consciously\nOr getting your your focus to shift to a obviously selling and and getting irate and making rational mills and they're not laughing all the way to the bank that's what I think that's truly what's happening here the problem with what with that data is ...\nIt's all subjective that's what that's what I think that's not what it is I Will say\nIf you like um if if you listen to past shows over the years but you can't on a park as I said the same thing in the prior down falls and sure enough I turned out to be right nothing change fundamentally stocks nothing changed ... ... where the economy if anything the quarterly reports got even better insure enough three months later\nPeople had more money than when they started with ... or more money before the height of the downfall so\nAnd and I think that's the same situation and I and I think another thing with killing this market is a lot of people are scared to death with Mitt terms\nI think that they think that uh if the if the the ... or take a shot the house the Senate and the Congress that they're going to wipe away a lot of uh what what Trump's gotten in the positive side as far as business goes\nAnd ah all hell is going to break loose so there's a lot of scare there um and and and you can't go on that because you never you never know what's going to be anymore and voting\nAnd at the end of the day it doesn't matter to companies and they're gonna they're gonna power forward and unless we have a black swan event I think part of your report is going to be upstate\n... alright let me read some emails and get your reaction to it I ever three different emails to read to you tonight the stock market is not liking Trump's terrorists down sixteen out of Twenty one sessions this month the let's see the snake he picked up is going to bite us all terrorists are taxes on us all\nBuckle up going down more he will blame Obama and the Democrats get ready to pay more for this stuff you need comment\nI absolutely disagree with that I I I feel bad for the person that wrote that email there are so you know steady kind of worked first of all if you look at the if you look at like what the terrorists and and what not none of it's really taking a factor in the end and the retail stores\nThen you go to the store you haven't paid more than once you've paid for a ... a year ago you the same cost I'm\n... and and and the terrorists were going to hurt the market is going to take a hell of a lot more than just a year year and a half past the parents actually hasn't even been\nI mean the tears just came in I Want to say last year it's going to take a lot of years for that to take a negative effect in the event and it does I think just the opposite I think it just comes down to the circus for you know anything Trump related if you're not a Trump supporter you know everything from salt and honestly I think that's a a bizarre comment\nOr even the I don't know what else to say too bizarre\nThan wrong All right so you don't think that they are the the the ... is a ... to follow up on that just is you you don't sense there's an uneasiness\nWith the with what's ahead with China see I think Trump is brilliant on China because he's saying I don't know I think it's like there's two hundred and fifty seven million or billion and he's got to sit and he's talking about slapping two hundred and fifty seven million or billion in tariffs additional tariffs on China\nThis is prior to his negotiations with China so it but he's made the statement China needs our marketplace the you know we're in the driver's seat they need our marketplace he's got those additional tariffs that he wants to slap on\nAnd you don't think that that's a strategy to bring him to the table to reach an agreement more favorable to the United states 'cause I think that's what that's all about when he goes into negotiations like that hungry\nHadn't hit um Hi I'm Hi she'd get what you want\nMe years ago the finance the but here's the thing the Chinese are are classic negotiators they know that game as much as anybody the problem is is what you said on the and they're just not what I said on the show many times the Chinese need us we don't need them we have the money to buy their crappy products we have the ... the people working\nWith our people are living in most of them are living in poverty to to to last them poverty or situations hot sun and combing rice fields that that's what they do over there and they have so many people that uh you know it's one of those things 'cause we're\nOnly a small part of the population early makes the kind of wages at the western civilization he you're absolutely correct and and what you're saying that\nChinese us we don't need them\nAnd you know what all went out and and my opinion nothing's changed and I'll I'll pull you out on the carpet have when you go to your shovel wherever you shop have you noticed any price difference and buying their products and services\nOr ... or I certainly are\nA couple of things certainly I haven't noticed that\nAs of yet but I Do agree with you I think jump with the ... the Trump with a two hundred and fifty seven billion additional tariffs\nIs ... is putting that out there to go into these negotiations with China I mean he said they need our marketplace more than we need them\nAnd he's going to go in and he's going to threaten the throw those down and they're going to come to the table because he's trying to deal with them stealing our pat and she's trying to dealing with them dumping their product in our marketplace he's trying to deal with the slave wages nation a nation as it is\nNinety nine Seventy seven three three zero seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven\nAppreciate those email me with the questions prior to

I went but it's a very popular sport at all the same characteristics of the marijuana stocks\nSo if you have the time or the energy you could subscribe to a various Web sites that do the do research on marijuana stocks\nI I'm compliance wise and and for honestly I'm just commonsense wise I\nI don't know enough about it a ... to to really recommend anything and and as Pacific through our clients our listeners but I Will say this was a lot of potential there and if you did enough research I'm sure you could make a ton of money doing\nWell\nAll right thank you Kevin I thank you Kevin alright British it back with John Arnold here and to what I'm reading here as part of the reason they say that the market went down was the drop in tech shares for the decline what does that mean John\n... thanks stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix I'm that's what that means that you know all those technicals technical stocks and what that means is you know fundamentally their technology related um those took a beating it took a beating like like we never see in common\nAnd and it was inevitably going to happen we didn't think I was going to happen this fast but it was definitely going to happen\nBut I'll also say this happened before and then they'll all those things stocks bottomed out stabilizing and pulled ahead really really quickly and it's as if they never went down but um that's what that means of technology which is making under the NASDAQ drug the NASDAQ down and\nTook the market with it and\nAnd now we're gonna have to wait for them to come back up\nHere's why ... you know here's why I think sometimes you have some\nSome issues out there there's a million different opinions are in the Federal Reserve is from Jim Kramer the Federal Reserve could cause a smaller version of the two thousand a financial crisis if it doesn't change its interest rate agenda is what the Kramer said uh any comment about that\nThat's pretty harsh if their gender is the raised in a ... a quarter per quarter\nHe's absolutely right I have a hard time believing that\nThey're going to want to do that unless it really is a politically motivated um that that would be senseless do I think that there's some minor increases common probably do I think that it's going to be a quarter to quarter no no and if it is that very well could happen because the money supply will tighten up\nAnd uh when money supply tightens up people will get laid off people get laid off the quit buying like a client may quit buying products with churches and then you're right we're back to where we words where people's homes are going to be foreclosed on Harman\nAnd it's going to be I'm going to be a lot of pain get lightning that's going to happen probably not I think that\nIf we're talking about an ear Youngstown, Ohio imagine what they're talking about an ... uh Washington Washington DC so I always look at the broader picture if we know about it right here in Youngstown, Ohio then I'd be a betting man to say that they got there on the ball you know in New York\nWashington DC you know where the power players are and and uh uh you know right now I think a lot of billionaires and millionaires or Lincoln was going on their companies are never made more money in and funds have never done better\nAnd now they didn't get to the way that freight train I think will one way or another be stopped without saying how it's going to be stopped\nAll right John ... is our guest news radio five Seventy nobody can be in\nTheir only been four times in gym Kramer's career when the stock grew ruined former hedge fund managers sold out of the sold out of his entire portfolio and scary as it sounds a market action in the past few weeks or a mind some of those moments as much as it pains me to say this the current situation can bind to some of the worst characteristics of those for past breakdowns\nKramer said as much as the stock market slid into correction to a territory\nOr so that that's why that's why you get these reactions because the you know you got guys with a ... billion different opinions based on history and this is with Trump or charting new territories here I mean I don't think historically we can look back much ... much\n'cause the things with China could come out really good I mean things could sore in a blink of an I\nI think I think the money and and and when I say big money I mean billionaires multimillionaire pension plans et cetera I think they're playing the biggest ... game over on the on on the trading the traders on people like us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "29"}
