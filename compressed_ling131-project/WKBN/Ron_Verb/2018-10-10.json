young\nI'm Scott Goldberg hurricane Michael's now hammering Florida's Gulf Coast after making landfall a couple of hours ago with one hundred fifty five mile per hour winds ABC's David beers in Panama City and says conditions are deadly\nElectric and to a natural gas the the heat bill of for the house and I but I was talking to him and I just give me an average you know of electric a natural gas\nYou know over the over the year just give me roughly about an average if it's low or whatever it might be what you would pay for your electric bill for example my last electric\nBill at for a banner was a hundred and thirty nine dollars just shy of spades I can tell exactly what it was a hundred and thirty nine dollars um [noise] so\nThen you know you you wouldn't use much natural gas obviously during the\nSummertime uh other than your hot water tank or feel like if she ever gets dry or something like that so you you would use of bulk of your natural gas watched uh mainly in the wintertime so if you if you did an average on that\nYou know what what would you say that that would be maybe a you know let's even go with eight eighty bucks does that sound reasonable to you guys\nSo you know in in on electric let's let's do a hundred bucks\nAll right so let's go one eighty a month for electric and natural gas\nNow this is just in this one guy one ... one guy's a scenario this is what I was talking about twelve fifty for his health care with five thousand dollar deductible he pays two hundred dollars for cable TV the Internet and all that kind of stuff two hundred and fifty dollars a month for property taxes let's say one eighty for his electric and natural gas\nUh per month now you have car insurance uh and you have a license plates license plates that you have to have that\nAll right so so you have to have that kind of stuff oh cell phone that he carries for his family that was another thing he said cell phone and that was a couple of hundred a month or just put that up here two hundred for cell phone for cell phones for himself and his family so it's two hundred a month before that\nSo anyway they had this up in his case for insurance let's just say let's just add this up real quick just in his case this is what what uh so\nInsurance twelve fifty a month every month the U.S to pay that the cell phones to hundred\nThe cable bill for Internet and all that stuff and it's just basic package two hundred property taxes to fifty I'm Still end up here uh electric and natural gas one eighty a month you know about a year round average\nI don't know what and you could help me out I don't know what license plates go for a car a for a year you know I didn't look that up a for a license plates but he says like car insurance you know you have to you you have to factor that in car insurance\nAnd the license plate so let's figure you know ... what do you want to you and I figure on car insurance which just figure fifty dollars a month in car insurance\nAll right let's just to add fifty for car insurance just for the hell of it it's\nAll right so for his family on something like that and license plates let's say there what Seventy five bucks or something like that will I'll leave that out for now [noise]\nSo in this one in this case case just this one guy who's also sixty years old incidentally in a friend of mine he he pays two thousand one hundred and thirty dollars a month and he has some bought any food he hasn't gone to a restaurant he hasn't seen a movie he hasn't done anything\nAbsolutely anything like I said to him now if you go to the doctor now you've incurred another bill because your health insurance doesn't cover it\nSee I'm just trying to explain to you how things are ... and many of you know this work in the private sector this is another small business guy that I Know All right so he's basically a self employed guy in a hustler and so he's paying two thousand one hundred and thirty dollars before he buys any food\nGoes sees him movie goes out to a restaurant buys any clothes buys you know gas for his car fixes his car does any of that stuff\nAny of that stuff\nTwo thousand one hundred and thirty dollars just in and he hasn't done anything\n\nAbout a month so what would that be twenty four thousand dollars a year\nJust for that just for that and he hasn't done anything\nHe's the one that gave me the inspiration for today's broadcast my buddy he says 'cause he's the one who says I Can't eat said to me I was talking to a Twenty one year our twenty two year old kid but no concept then I sat there thinking what is this going to be when you're forty\n\nWhen I looked at it you know his concern is not just what he's paying now but what is what's gonna happen when that kid is forty years old I Can't even imagine what these numbers are going to be\nHow anyone will be able to do it\n\nSo in ... and I I was talking to one another a woman over the weekend and for her health insurance\nFor her family is Seventeen hundred dollars a month with a huge deductible Seventeen hundred dollars a month plus and you start adding all these other bills\nYou know and that kinda stuff even if you look at your fearless leader here at the radio station ... what comes out of our pay here and my pay in my case is roughly six hundred dollars a and I'm a double check it might be more than six hundred dollars a month comes out for healthcare coverage long term short term disability\nOr you know you're a health savings accounts you're a\nUm dental and vision and all this kinda stuff or your insurance it's actually more than six on it I can tell you now now that I think about it's probably closer to eight hundred so so you know you start you you factor those numbers in to what are your monthly expenses\nIn it I Want to do that with some of you know some of you if that are out there those of you know that pay your bills\nBecause the point he was trying to make to me and I thought it was a really good point was this is where it is for him\nWhat's uh what will it be when is twenty two year old kid is forty years old I ... you know he said I Can't even imagine it's so ridiculous now\nAnd then I read these surveys I read these surveys that say\nA lot of you listening don't have five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars to fix your car if your car breaks people don't have money in the bank\nNow here's another you know I'm I'm I'm kind of going in a million directions here with this because this is this has been a discussion that I've been having\nWith ah with numerous people that are that I Know just looking at expenses\nUm [noise] a a buddy of mine was walking with somebody in a government job in the courts talking about\nExpenses property taxes and expenses and he says I don't know how people do it to make less than I Do 'cause it's tough on me and he does pretty good\nIn Islam and turned to him and said because in this neighborhood that were walking in right now\nYou have no idea but I Do how many people are filing bankruptcy on credit cards it's astronomical how many people are saying you know they they can't pay their credit card so they file bankruptcy\n\nAnd she was saying in this neighborhood you know which is a nice neighborhood they were walking and\n\nNot what you guys to pause and think about this and and I and I and I want to talk to some some of the rest you out there and you'd have to know this I mean you'd have to know in the end it's hard for me to do it with mine because I'm\n\nYou know I I mean I pay a time I'm just going to tell you and the license plates because of my business\nI mean I pay a ton I mean ... if I go to license plate bureau and it's hard for me because it it easily be eight hundred dollars because when you started getting in a commercial plates and stuff it's ridiculous\nI mean just for license plates I mean a year every year so you know for me it's more difficult for me as a small businessman even though you know I'm\nA whenever you're small businessman I think of you know small people but needless to say I mean it's it's hard for me to go over that in in that sense now I can tell you\nUh like with my car insurance like you have car insurance for my uh obviously my wife and my daughter and you know cars or cars and that kind of stuff so you know you'd have to break out what is what is your car insurance pay I pay it every six months\nAnd I'm going to say you know for my car insurance it's roughly a thousand dollars for every body\nFor six months as far as their cars or concerns are\nSo like if I go in my own stuff just to and I'm just getting off the top of my head my homeowner's insurance is twelve hundred dollars a year\nFrom my home my car insurance for my family is a thousand dollars a half so it'd be two thousand dollars a year for car insurance\n[noise] change so that would be right yeah two thousand for that twelve hundred for homeowners insurance [noise] uh let me see here at uh and uh what else can I pass along so two thousand twelve hundred\nI'm I must say it's about a\n... what do you what would you say license plates and that kind of stuff would be I'm not talking about before I buy a liquor food you know so like I say my property tax like send you a million times are roughly three hundred and forty dollars a month\nJust for property taxes just for

I don't want to hear about I don't want to do food or restaurants or any of that kinda stuff\nNone of it's just what what are your utilities what are your\nUh automobiles cost you know as far as uh all this kind of stuff just uh it's astronomical\nAnd I'm a I'm going to try to make is just astronomical now I've talked to people who have to buy their healthcare which like his in one case Seventeen hundred a month or twelve fifty a month\nI mean that's huge expense with huge deductibles\nBut you know a lot of you that are listening out there you probably have money taken out of your paycheck to or the ... your employer takes to put towards the cost of your health care coverage for you and your family what does that you've got a factor that into what are your monthly expenses\nBefore you go out to eat before you see a movie before you buy any groceries before you buy any close\nBefore you pay any tuition what does that number to all the few that are listening what does that number it's shocking\nIs what I'm trying to say to you it will be an eye opening shocker but it's gonna be requiring you you know ... there's someone in your household pays the bills and would probably know what those bills are\n\nAnd where they have to sit back and look at those numbers and what are those numbers add up to\n\nSeven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seriously seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven now there's many scenarios I'm going to do here you take somebody that's retired on a fixed income well they're retired on a fixed income they only way that this is how much money they got coming in and what are they doing all this all this costs keep going up\nPick someone in a job\nYou know maybe their wages are stagnant maybe we have people like we've seen here as I said yesterday you take a look locally in our in our economy here I like to in this Sally phrased it any more than two thirds of General Motors Lourdes town is closed because a third shift is gone and the second shift is gone one third of General Motors lords down is open\nOne shift nor side hospital\nGone you know these are all good paying jobs that people made that are gone\nWhat's a ripple effect so you take a look like for example a city Youngstown there you know taking guys from\nAnd taking their rank away in a fire department justly so to lower costs money to Davis who's a retired from the young sound police department is saying you know where to top heavy here we've got to do the same thing here we've got too many chiefs and not enough Indians we\nGot to cut some of that rank out in low work are operating costs because we don't have the money coming in from these entities are like we used to\n\n... am I making sense to you\nAnd I making sense to you I mean ... that's what I Want to try to figure out what some of you I Want to use some of you as examples guinea pigs that's what I Want to use you for and I want you to think about this I mean it's going to require a certain amount of thought on your end because you're going to have to say well what is\nYou know like it like I Am but I pay the my my bills and I like I Know my homeowner's insurance is twelve hundred dollars a little over that but it's a hundred dollars a month just for\nInsurance on my house like I said so that is a hundred a month I Know my cell phone bills or two fifty for my family a month\nI don't know how to how how even to describe that uh I I see no end in sight to any of these things I see absolutely no end in sight we're becoming socialist and to no end in sight you wait and see I mean uh I'm a you will see\nNot only that but they don't\nI don't get tenure to print money and value in the face our courage [noise]\nWell I I think you know Trump is I I think Trump as a whole ... of saving the federal government but I don't have much hope and politicians Republicans or Democrats to fix the spending problem I Do agree with Trump if you can get GDP up you get more revenue coming in you can control spending I think he's he's the answer to this but I think if\nYou don't want to run as a revenue goes up they spent correct this and this time here\nThat short corner be okay for now but then as you know 'cause this is all cyclical as they have a a revenue problem what they're going to do is they're gonna they're gonna end up raising taxes yet as opposed to cutting\nCorrect that's what they do they need to the size of government to ride on trial maybe the best president that we in the last fifty or a hundred or a hundred and fifty years whatever\nBut in the end of his job if he does not reduce the size of the government that is correct what the government I'm only\nWatch they take from us I don't care if they employ more people\nWill know no government it's gotten to be it's gotten too big too costly and ah I sincerely think as you see interest rates go up the federal government's yeah it is on the course really to be insolvent at some point it will not be able to meet its obligations\nA button who am I saying solving it will affect people on Medicare Social security or everybody who gets the government paycheck likewise I Believe state governments are on the verge on the path of going insolvent\nBecause of a well first of all lack of fiscal responsibility but these retirements are obligations that they have that they can afford and so ultimately I think you're seeing a lot of individuals that are that the bigger go down the tubes [noise]\nIt's just it's unsustainable model\nRight ... you know I sound I sound to you or to these people that are listening out here like I mean guy and but I Want to make this clear I you if you get hooked on opioids I don't care that's your problem All right you and your family you

I found him refreshing um I think there are a lot of people who view us if you're a Trump voter and supporter is nuts\nAs ... nuts [noise] I'll be damned if I can figure it out a I'm very pleased with\nEverything he has done so far I mean I I find it refreshing quite frankly that he fulfilled campaign promises because most cases they come and lie to you raise your taxes are promised you stop and never deliver\nTime and time and time again bunch damn liars well I think Trump is fulfilling his promises and I think his ideas just make common sense to me and I supported those ideas in the campaign trail\nWhy have a corporate tax it's so ridiculously high money's not going to come back in the country we didn't eliminate it we just made it competitive smart idea benefiting economy now\nWhy do we go with these deals to screw America like NAFTA putting America First totally agree watched a a totally agree with that renegotiated NAFTA with China with Mexico and Canada\nNobody else would have ever done that\n[noise] went and took on NATO allies said hey you guys said two percent of GDP is what you do you what you pay and you're not doing it oh he's rude and crude he's all the things that he didn't care it was there to say on a man with a mission you need to live up to your obligation to NATO we're tired of footing the bill I find that refreshing\n\nLow unemployment since low since Nineteen what sixty nine or just a job growth is there so there's a lot of good stuff that's happening as a result you know where ISIS is not an\nIssue terrorism has been an issue employments good unemployment's down\nRenegotiating deals that have been screw in our country I have no regrets whatsoever in voting for Donald Trump I think Hillary Clinton would have been a disaster\n\nA and I think that there's an arrogance among people get the impression from Tim Ryan on television the other night when he was talking to Gino that he was almost snow but his nose at him because he was a Trump voter like the problem with Trump voters\nOne of the problem with you is you don't understand why people voted for Trump and why they're sick and tired of lion politicians career politicians who do nothing but talk shared brown has done nothing Tim Robbins do nothing so you know this guy is actually doing something for whatever reason they don't want to support it at all\nIn it from my perspective as an American I support him because I think America is better off\n\nThe economy is better off I think the military is better off I think police are better off I think a lot of stuff is better off I Do not go for the mob mentality that I've been watching from the Democratic party\nI find it reprehensible I have no desire to vote for anybody who stands in a way the president getting his agenda done because I think it's an agenda that's the writer John it's one that I agree with I think they're good ideas and I support good ideas and I'm willing to try him so if you don't support the president that I don't support you\n'cause I'm tired of mediocre performance and mediocrity and putting America certainly not first by Republicans and Democrats\nBut I'm telling you as a as the Trump voter a lotta people look down their nose like you're not you're a whack job or something really I don't understand how you can't look now and say well you know what I was on the stuff makes sense because the people who are the resistance than to make a damn bit of sense to me\nA great on a cell phone seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven top secret number three three zero seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven run verb you're on the air\nFor a issue to the mental health are you out of your mind you follow what I'm saying I mean so I I I I think we have we have economic problems I'm not saying that we don't have the good side with the joke in company with the power plant billion dollar project it's opening potentially another one with T. J. max\nBut the hits that I just mentioned are big hits for the area we seem to lag behind the rest of the country\nAre perfect and part of that is political corruption a too strong a union mentality and the image we have in the area which was starting to fade but then you get around ... with you know one hand washes the other and ... and it comes roaring right back\nWhen was the last time any local politicians talk specifically about economic development used those words\nWell here's what they do they show up on their clothes and our site I spittle down and they stand around with the people out on the line and it only accomplished a damn thing they're not there are two years ahead of time before north side hospital closes\nYou follow what I'm saying All right three hundred percent so it's all about his reading those Asia\nRight it's all show now there's a couple of things you know Morales beach in talks about regional association as far as\nYou know we're going to have what we are losing population and our community this is the reality we're losing population and we're an older population so the tax base is shrinking you can't continue to grow local government with a shrinking task tax base\nSo he's talking regionals ... you know that's when I talk about taxes and that kind of stuff that is what I make a used as an example oftentimes township and boardman township pay the highest village in the county okay there the ... there is off the charts\nIt's much different from let's say a Jackson township for example Jackson township as a one point something milk police levy out there okay\nThey have they have a chief an assistant chief and one guy on the road it's a very small police department but it's a good one needs to operate if I Lived in Jackson township your ... like in Austin Town of Portland I Would vote for that levee\nYou follow what I'm saying I Would say well I'm a all support that because you were able to support it to keep that because you know you want to keep your officer on the road you don't have seven guys on his shift you have one\nYou follow me uh so so you know unit that you need that so it depends where you live in what your finances are you know everybody should vote what they think is important to them that what I tell them to do\nBut you know there's ramifications that come as a result of it I mean like I said most people don't understand millage but Austin Town in Portland township as some of the highest millage around well how much more expect those people to pay\nI agree how do we stop the population loss and the tax base last we do that through job correct economic development or focus needs to be\nCorrect in for example are no he'll I think he's done an excellent job\nWill take you take a look at and what took place with his TJ acts with some of the knuckleheads out there that were detrimental to economic growth I mean you you see what I'm saying I'm In I'm In a hundred percent with you what will maintain your property values and I'm not optimistic personally for the future of General Motors Lourdes town I just tell you I'm not\nPersonally optimistic with it I'm very troubled by it and uh so you know your your home value could you could\nDecrease the ill let's just say if that plant would close and twenty twenty you're home value could decline by twenty five thousand dollars in the blink of an eye\nAbsolutely yep thank you I appreciate your time\nAppreciate it news radio five Seventy nobody can be an and that's a reality you know I you know any of these politicians can go out there Mary Barra it's not going to make a commitment to any of them\nAnd there are ... and and they're not so the plan has positives like I said it's got a rail it's got freeway access gateway to the east it's got a fat plant associated with it but\nThere are negative issues too many of those negative issues out there from the management perspective of GM orange town our labor issues so you know when I hear we got the best workers in the world that's not necessarily true uh you know there are a lot of labor issues but you know the\nPlant the physical plan has a lot of assets to it I just wonder can you maintain a facility like that on one shift I I don't know if that's doable news radio find somebody that can be on Iran from [noise]\nCommerce and Bobby right back

be careful you allow on your property or in your home you guys have been with you for Thirty years I mean I'm Serious about that'd be careful you allow in with the guys from seam acts they'd been there for a long time\nThat's a very interesting you know we we never said on a cell support to each other but it's amazing that you know some people were selling shoes yesterday was my dad's and found pizzas tomorrow and they're going to walk in and hook up a whole range for your house\nI'm sure hook up a washer water oh boy that's an interesting thought\nOr or who knows what their criminal record is something like that\nOh yes well not even going there or what they're walking out of your house with yes that's a yeah your guys are are walking on normally with cookies and stuff and the ladies get one 'cause I'd solve them and I can tell you who's eating them\nThank you very hot and say that about ... to the max and whatever I wasn't saying about her I just making sure\nYou know but I mean this is what makes a difference selection knowledge customer service or any and all around good American and a handsome man who would that be\nLike I Know you've talked about before\nThose kind of those things kind of build off of themselves and that's a pretty big building to sit empty for something like Amazon even to\nWell you have the whole hopefully that's not the case but I mean you know I mean that's how I approach a two thirds of General Motors Georgetown is closed because two of the ships are gone that's three thousand people you have one shift raining so you know\nThat that's the stark reality two thirds of junior ... close to that's a lot of people that aren't working in North ... close completely\nThat failure to prepare is preparing to fail and ... actually\nA John was talking yesterday when he was on the show you know there really needs to be an economic council committee or in Youngstown ... you know when Trump first got elected and he was president there was a an ... an economic or um where apple Amazon all these that got together\nUntil you know they're liberal agenda broke all that up but I thought that was the smartest thing ever you get all these people in our country or in our area where are the business owners and the people moving things can move things actually change policy and if they're not change of policy at least the people in power listen to it\nI mean I I don't understand how you can be of any office in our area and not think of that it's easy it's easy and simple to do and believe me all these people in business and power they want it\nThat's how you get how did you change policy it's called lobbying you\nDo things to make things work for you\nWell I don't care she'll see politicians are interested in the votes so they'll go out and cater to the union to General Motors Ford sun 'cause they're more votes or they won't cater to the they won't go in and do in NASA management what are the problems here with the future of this facility\nUh which I mean and those are the people who alternately will make the decision you know those are the people that are going to say what is their absenteeism right here what is their disability right here what is our union ah ah issues over the years we've had here those are the things that will be deciding factors\nThat can sway you one way or the other you can launch every kind of campaign you want the plan has good ... good points I think but it has negative points to\n[noise] I Know a Trump is an eerie tonight there any uh planets and that you know of coming back Youngstown anytime soon\nHadn't heard anything would love to see 'em but ... I mean really a lookout Beatrice treats them as they are obviously so Democratic Party chairman\nBut take a look at how Tim Ryan is so many Tim Ryan can't even can't even Tim Ryan is no Jim Traficant he can't even acknowledge the good stuff Trump has done that could benefit the valley and bring them here and maybe make a stand out a little bit\nMore concerned with ... behind so\nWell you know there I think there's a lot of Democrats out there that don't like a lot of what's\nGoing on in that don't like what's going on and if he actually\nPut his neck out on the line and said what was the truth and just like you're saying I think he'd turn a lot of people on to his voice because she'd be the only one from the Democratic party saying anything yeah it was just like Trump in the primary he was one voice among Seventeen or stay in the exact same thing\nIt's Tim Ryan were smart you do that but obviously he's not as we've been saying\nThank you for your call news radio find somebody to ... to ... kilo\nHigher on and I think I have two point five is it's a habit of it do that because yes then the thing that dead heart of having now\nMy physician was that we did not have either that either side and especially the Democrats are left as are never others\nAnd their own language because obviously does not look like that have another attack if ever there was indeed an attacker who forever backpack that arise\nYou right now I'm documentaries voice right\nAll right\nSo that we're sending has been put it in his tank to Eddie first having ... having years and now we can actually to find that it's so it's a contest and with their\nUsual philosophy but my main reason for ... was about your question of our government has gotten too big and too much after taxes\nYeah certain functions that the founders ... they're not armed men functions schooling not government function when you're ... your\nProperty taxes go in and the low for schools and those are not government functions in fact many people taking their children out the guy that relate to the socialist calm so their school and then ... the eventually become\nA fee then the socialism and that is something that we don't need to reduce aquatic education as a little bit of a stretch because it for a lot of indoctrination and ideology filling in their mind and making them\nLook at these gardens that don't exist\nOh All right what else on your mind\nUh well I can go on this one I think uh this is something that I that everybody listening wrong that government is not supposed to be a ... their time and manage at a bank or anything else as well\nSo that is something which is an arc of climate\nAnd I send you a status that you eventually put it on air that people that read drying twice as much as they are putting in so to say that I'm desperate drying but I put in is not true they're taking out twice as much and then it becomes a Ponzi scheme\nAnd then it cannot be testing and about these Medicare things\nEmbedded in the Nineteen seventies there said when with housing drugs around it could cost ... billion they've ended up costing ooh hundred billion so they put off by it and for thing when you were saying that what happens when you\nAnd then at that and the answer all their money as soda that number will be off the chart these exponential growth that nobody can even imagine but the numbers\nGoing I mean if you think about a doctor I mean like like what I was talking to a guy that's he pays twelve one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars a month for his health insurance with a five thousand dollars\nAnd the duck the ball for his family and he and he made a great point when he said to him and he said in my uh cable bill is\nTwo hundred thousand dollars a month my cell phone bill is two hundred and fifty dollars a month you went through I I wrote them down all of his monthly expenses which basically\nWere a couple of thousand a month and that didn't include buying food going to a restaurant putting gas in the car or anything you know included as property taxes and all all that stuff he said it's a couple of thousand a month which is twenty four thousand a year he said just in\nHealthcare and all in property taxes and all those kind of stuff and he said when he was talking and he's sixty was talking to twenty two year old he was telling me and he said I Can't imagine what those numbers would be if we stay this course when you're forty years old\nThat would be it ... there's no way anybody's income will keep pace I think that's kind of what you're saying with the with the with these numbers the system to just go bust because nobody will be able to afford anything\nYeah I think that different ... and things that you mentioned the ... on you got to make the cars within ...
