my whole life but\nThis year's election I already did my little sample ballot I voted for five Republican five Democrats\nTim Ryan came into this community with a grassroots effort that's thing possible and I don't know where he lost a he just I forgot about where he got his start\nWhile I'm going to answer that I'm an answer that question for you because uh you know he ran for this office he got elected to it and then he started getting a big pay check into big benefits and then he started ... you know you're getting to know people in the party you can see below sea and everything and\nDuring that process\nKnow in living in Washington and during that ... you know never working in the private sector never never really working in a in a physical or working in the private sector type job never never and to and basically goes there gets caught up in that culture gets caught up with his with\nHis colleagues forgets about this stuff going on here and then he has a more interested in where he can go next to a party in ... you know the party the party politics you either go along with us or we're going to back your opponent ... this kind of you know how he got it\nRight but but not that I'm answering your question now but so you know you go along with us or we're going to back your opponent you either a uh in any says well where can I go in the party so his focus became him and his political career in his future\nAnd he lost what ... what we loved about Traficant\nWas he couldn't come and say hey you know watch this guy's doing something about something that I've been complaining about for sixteen years now do you guys have done it I'm supporting them a hundred percent he lost his independence and his backbone to be an American and represent the constituents of his district and be able to acknowledge\nHey you know what cutting taxes is working on an economy look at the growth pay you know what cutting regulations that you know I don't know why Jim right to go talk today Johnson as a businessman and see what regulations were doing was business\nI mean you that you want to know how we lost track that's how we lost track he became a politician with the paycheck and and aspirations and he's taking your vote for granted\nExactly even the Mac center he had nothing to\nDo with that last in it he jumped on board and then he takes all the credit for what happened that he would cause\nThe levees that you're talking about and there's only one let me in my area that I'm going to vote for it I think there are six or seven but it doesn't matter if you vote for them yes or no you know and what happens is it just goes back on it\nYet right vote on it yeah you're right\nYou're right you're right that this guy is correct folks listening 'cause he's a say absolutely correct we don't take no for an answer we keep putting it back and back and back till it till it passes\nNow who pays for that no every time we do they know that you know we end up paying for that no ... some of these groups you don't like this for the city has to be supported by independent money to put it back on the ballot\nBut our taxpayer money is paying for it to go back on and on and what's the matter if you vote yes or no it's got to go back\nOn what no you're you're you're you're actually making a correct statement but you know here's my argument and I and I would ask you to consider this not in all cases because you know you ... you have to assess\n... there's a thing called millage okay like that I pay ... township have the highest middle age in the county All right so so so your residence and those communities your property taxes are through the roof are ready for the most part because of the village now versus middle age that you look at it in other communities\nYou know so you see you have to assess everything based\n... you know based on that that's why I say government has to understand\n... ... in my my problem with government is government doesn't appreciate\nAll the taxes and levees that you're already paying for you follow what I'm saying that is totally tell you that is totally taken for granted they only get pissed particularly at me and said that they only get pissed because of the ones\nAdditional ones that I say I don't want to pay I say I'm paying enough you need to be more efficient what about all those other ones that I passed and voted for that you guys seem to take for granted and forget it's always more and more and more with you so I'm saying instead we have to change the thinking in saying\nI made my mistakes probably Romney would have been a better choice than Obama but I voted for Obama in in all reality I think there still is a major problem in health care and I mean a major problem in health care problem and and I came out of a right and I and I don't think the current system\nWould which at increases beyond inflation was good so I'm willing to take a chance on Obamacare\nAnd in hopes that that would work unfortunately it failed and I'm also willing to say to you just what it failed and it failed miserably and ... and it did not do anything\nThat it did and then when Obama got around to not supporting the military and some of the wacko that the anti police thing he had with the shootings in this kind of stuff\nHe lost me on on his ... and a net and frankly I tell ya Hillary Clinton and been guys see the lying I'd been guys the cover up on been guys see Obama you know I Wish Obamacare what at work I really\nDo but I Do 'cause I mean where she would've succeeded we need health care to work on and on so I saw a satellite gradually over time\nNo I said I've had I've had enough I've had enough of him I've given um sixteen years what more can I possibly yes so you know you you might have viewed that sooner than I did but at least I'm here to say to you this is why I did what I did\nAnd I give you that man and and I'm Glad you saw the light because you've been a pretty good advocate for everything that Trump has a sense he's taken office and I too low to Ross Perot and it was you and I unfortunately that split that vote and allowed Clinton to get in when he beat Bush Bush\nLast comic hang on hang on a comeback [noise]\nHey here's an idea we're looking at in Colorado they are instituting war day school week they're saving on

money that we had coming in when we had more enrollment makes up for the last that we're not getting from the state now that would be the counter argument\n[noise] and I can buy that to a certain degree but you know they've never trimmed expenses either if you look at public employees almost all of them and particularly in the schools they have Cadillac insurance that you and I could only

ten million dollars\n\nYou know they are or their wages are stagnant for twenty five or Thirty years are finally starting to see movement there\n\nBut if you're reading about public pensions going belly up in the in communities private pensions going belly up in a lotta places the Teamsters or for are concerned about that yeah there's still some serious issues of that are that are out there\n\nAlthough I think Trump's doing a terrific job it's certainly refreshing in a step in the right direction to say the least but when I say to you the best social program is a good job I mean it's when I say to you that you should be held accountable for the decisions you make I mean it\nWhen I say government can get too big and tried to do too much and too expensive on all levels I mean it\nWhen I say the best place for your money is in your pockets and you know you have to pay taxes for certain services I mean it\nYou're smart enough to say well I can afford this or I Need this or or or this is something I Want to make a sacrifice for because it's worth it\n\nBut you got to get that but that has to be something given a great deal of consideration\nA lot of people don't even know what's well\nLet's just leave it at that four fifty one in the afternoon Ron for news radio five Seventy to give you know I mean when I read that headline forty percent of the American middle class face poverty in retirement [noise]\nWhat's that until you were things that\nBack [noise]\nYou know there are so many people that er Cox sure that our local officials drives it looks bad but remember this deal with ... or ... the Dan River show\nWeekday mornings at eight months five Seventy WKBD and\nTrojan then food and and answering questions from every six having ...\n\nHello I'm

testified that the war's calls a trillion dollars the\nIraq War and she was living costs about one trillion dollars as about a year ago\nSilly and aside the uh any cost benefit analysis of actually supporting any attacks on our land since uh nine eleven uh our cumulative debt would only be fourteen million dollars if we had not had the war right roughly yeah okay [noise]\nUh the mystery into my colleague in our prosecutors and a former life so we didn't follow politics and economics perhaps is obviously is closely somebody has learned as you did the a hundred eleven Congress the budget that they passed was it balanced\nOn how the hundred and twelve hundred lemon under limit no\nActually don't think they pass the budget but but let's give them a budget resolution assuming argue window or was there any discussion of actually balancing that budget\nOn time zones budget proposed by the president was it balance the budget or not propose nor voted on by the Senate or is there any discussion of that thing balanced I Know\nIn the Nineteen nineties the glory days when a Republican Congress forced President Clinton to have a balanced budget and generated a surplus was that money used to pay down the debt\nOn during the periods of surplus uh we we reduce the federal debt outstanding\nWe paid down the debt to how much how how far do we get down on the film I Know [noise]\nProbably in the neighborhood of five or six hundred billion dollars over four years of surplus as I was ... billion would be that's great\nI'm In the past fifty years how many surpluses simple yeah\n... five I well I'll give you a fixed if even find okay\n[noise] um we have a constitutional and then that provides for the generation of revenue but yet you argue we should not have one for capping spending\nThat a fair assessment\nI don't think you should have a balanced budget amendment that takes any of the tools to reduce the debt off the table that would be my position we do\nHave a constitutional amendment that provides for revenue production correct\nIf you're talking about the amendment that allowed for the income tax that one that's correct yeah we have to that relate to alcohol\nRight yes\nAnd we have one that even limits congressional salaries and how they can be impacted yes then fifty years we have managed to produce a surplus either five or six times and you think we have this self restraint to balance our budget\nI didn't say I think you have the self restraint to balance your budget I said this that that the restrained is not going to be provided by amending the constitution you demonstrated the restraint to reduce the federal deficit at times when there was a consensus around doing that that's what's happened in the Nineteen nineties we also were Fifteen trillion dollars in debt\nAgreed\nOr that would be in the gross that yes the mystery and\nMr Chairman ... cannot have an additional thirty seconds to ask without objection doctor hold so you can to more questions if we were to take our colleagues on the other side of the aisle up on their idea of of punishing people who had the unmitigated temerity to be successful\nLet's tax the billionaires at say ... percent\nWell that saw more fiscal was no let's say that we took them up on their idea to do away with the subsidies for so called the goal and while we're at it let's do away with the subsidies for the entire green industry as well\nWell that balance the budget now what about those dreadful corporate jet owners if we just did away with that that balance the budget you know can you balance the budget without taking on entitlements no like Mr\nAll right so there you go so basically you learn something there so you can't ... or so far in debt you learn to things from that questioning\nThat first of all the politicians can't be fiscally responsible in Washington and balance the budget secondly we're so far in a hole that you can cut all of that stuff military spending discretionary spending the wars and you can't balance the budget\nThat's where we are uh and uh that's the problem let's go next to Steve news radio five Seventy to carry on hello there\nHow are you OK sorry go ahead with your comments\nUm yeah I just wanted to go now today you know I'm for the first time ever ... [noise]\nUm yeah we were really today the first time ever in my life when he gets off\nI voted a straight party for stock top to bottom of the Republican\nBecause I Am so disgusted with the treatment of what the democratic treatment people\nUm on all issues and the fact that they are so willing to accept fringe voters as the norm so I ... I'm not going to look at individual people any more on the local level three in the state level I was going to vote\nRepublican at least for the ... just to show complete disdain and hope this red Waco [noise]\nWell ... to respond to what you what you did I find it's um\n[noise] I'm offended by Hillary Clinton thanking Trump voters are deplorable I think that I think uh I think Democrats look down on anybody who crossed over and voted for Trump I think they stopped there knows that people who voted for Trump I don't think they understand why Trump won I think the Democratic party is totally and completely out of step with working people\nUh taxes they forgot their base and they started catering the all the oddball groups out there\nAre all of the eyeball groups out there they started having a mentality of punishing the productive people take more from them and give it to unproductive um\nThen they started with this mob mentality disrupting the Kavanaugh hearings\nAre like they were doing getting in their faces\nSo these guys are going to their office by Hillary Clinton was deplorable the guy saying well when they go low will kick him of Hillary Clinton saying we can't be civil to these people\nBasic a demo how they want to operate I detest that you know I I I I find it's a I find that there's nothing about it nothing about it that I support\nI Am and incomes below twenty three thousand for singles in thirty one thousand for couples further to point six million of those eight point five million\nWorldly mobile workers and their spouses will have incomes below the poverty level of eleven six and Fifteen seven\nIt can be debated as to how this happens who's to blame who's ultimately responsible for retirees wellbeing and retirement most importantly they'll employers and employees need to focus on a fix personal savings is obviously a needed conversion and sponsors of pension plans\nWhether corporate government from all the employer needs to ensure they're doing their part to finish\nUp for you after the break in more falls at night\nLast year the Dow Jones industrial average was up just over twenty five percent everything was so good even the self help experts were giving on investment advice but you also saw a lot of fear fear of missing out\nIn fear of crashing\nThe here's the thing here is an emotion not an investment strategy if you're making your own investment decision emotion plays a role whether or not you realize\nSome eight twenty team the year that you can fear out of your portfolio make an appointment with a financial engines advisor today and get a solid logical financial plan for your future one that helps take some of the fear out of the equation can self help gurus not your financial security and the time\nYou get your financial engine dot com today [noise]\nHi I'm Doug corporate financial engineering nonstop I'm ready to work with you don't make your financial goals every out to the financial engines dot com or call three three zero seven to six thirty one hundred to [noise]\nNeed to go to fifth or let the new castle transit authority drive you relax\nRead a book check your email leading as early as for thirty five AM\nPen returning his latest for forty five pm Monday through Thursday had eleven thirty pm on friday\nNewcastle transit saves you feel Simon aggravation as you travel is it's very tough downtown including the ... the new capital transit authority visit Newcastle transit dot org for complete credit for making is scheduled Newcastle transit authority go in your way\nOf contact with them than I was also in Baghdad\nThe death toll from hurricane microwave on the rise as crews continue to search for survivors that Italy and landing people are now confirmed dead National Guard soldiers some northeast Ohio too are on their way to help in those hurricane relief efforts in Florida\nMembers of the two hundred thirty eight aviation regiment lap Akron Canton in a theater forty five and ... and\nIt's getting colder out and colder temperatures Nate pushed them unwanted pets inside your home spiders are out in both the than it probably the greatest exterminating top twenty seven first new spider hate the cold it's also mating safe and two reasons why the Iraq mid are annoying you now in your home\nFrom the ... Buick GMC account kinda Ohio knees or I Am I'm happy day that offer so\nWhat's interesting where if you are listening to the prior to the news where basically they're saying is you get older you are not to you you can go into poverty really quick it can be debated\nHow ... how this happened who's to blame who's ultimately responsible for retirees wellbeing and retire most important to do employers employees need to focus on a fix\nPersonal savings is obviously a needed conversion\nAnd sponsors of pension plans for the corporate governmental 'em all to employ any to ensure they're doing their part not coincidentally older Americans increasing continue to work longer than their forbearers more than twenty percent of the workforce in the United states is fifty five or older a historic high end that percentage is expected to increase Seventy four percent of Americans say they plan to work past\nTraditional retirement age\nYou know and one of the reasons taxes how much money government's taken employers need to complete an in depth analysis of their business models risk management policies benefit offering some financial options\nTo total compensation approach\nA defined

is a use some source of cash grades volatile liabilities and expenses and causes negative consequences off at the worst time in a business cycle so there\nIs so in essence there you have to sing interesting article forty percent of America's middle class face poverty in retirement and that will retire later that was one thing I wanted to pass along to you I got another thing you know get back to calls momentarily I promise you\nGet a lot of this I just want you to be aware of this you know if you get any of these camera ticket from you and you ended up paying All right uh\nUnder also took effect to government agencies may no longer lower uh\nMotorists credit score over unpaid traffic tickets are parking citations the three major credit reporting agency Experian Equifax and trans union agreed to a new policy in a legal settlement with thirty one state attorney generals\nThe credit reporting agencies will eliminate the reporting of debts that did not arise from a contract or agreements by the consumer to pay such as tickets their fines\nXerox collection director Michel de brown wrote experience has already submitted a cease and desist notification to Xerox fraud credit reporting transactions listed is unacceptable data\nExamples include but are not limited to telling charges vehicle storage fees parking and traffic tickets fines toll road fines fees\nIn March the three credit reporting agencies informed debt collectors that they were just stop sending notices of unpaid red light cameras citations do not report that that did not arise from a contractor agreement to pay including but not limited to certain fines tickets or other assessments\nFor example library fees or find parking tickets speeding tickets in court fees are fines motorists with existing red light camera speed camera or parking ticket dead on their credit report can expect that their records will be cleared\nThe legal settlements consumers have new rights to dispute incorrect items on their report\nThe policy could have a major impact in states where they use of collection agencies in depth reporting has been the only means of enforcing citations to use civil not criminal like these cameras all\nOver here legal procedures in Texas for example is up to the discretion of the county assess or whether to put a hold on a vehicle registration over an unpaid citation most counties will allow registrations of the vehicle owner comes to the office to renew in person\n[noise] we have known for a long time that payment of civil photo enforcement tickets in Texas is virtually and I guess virtually optional\nStarving the system of cash is the quickest way to end the program [noise] All right so if I go here let's see they agreement was reached a was in the states and one of them is Ohio\nThe credit reporting agencies shell prohibit collections furniture's from reporting that that did not arise from any contractor agreement to pay\nSo you so what this says is if you get one of those camera tickets you know what I'm Talking about and you don't pay it it will have no effect on your credit is zero the credit agencies don't want any ... they don't want anything to do with them\nSo that credit agencies recognized for what it is a you know a money shakedown so basically if you get one of these camera tickets and you don't pay they used to say well we're going to turn it over the collection if you tell a collection agency I'm not paying it\nThan they would say well it's going to go on your credit report well no it's not you know what happens nothing zero\nSo what they're saying here is why pay him\n\nSo there you have it it doesn't go to it does go on your credit report it all\nAnd now it's dealing with China I you know and and and the people that are saying well or help they didn't support him if Tim ride would have got Hillary Clinton none of this stuff what avenue that TPP and a lousy NAFTA agreement\nThey got that right you know I voted for uh [noise]\nFor a brief history I'm looking I'm trying to I'm lost your job them turn on my navigation I'm trying to address but anyway no I ... I voted for the the little guy with the uh what the ... the fell asleep or a runner was you know what I'm\nTalking about a Perot so did I I bought it for for all because I I ... I worked a cardio Shemp right\nNear where ... was in a outside of Washington in Virginia suburbs and the people that came in there and once they became part of the GM you know they come in there to to uh use their\nNew benefits to buy a car and everything but\nThere were the nicest people they were smart people too but they didn't seem more now they seem like on a plane they didn't seem like auto workers they were they were like very\nVery polite and they might even seem like Washington people they weren't trying to put me on the program they weren't listening about me telling about what their program was and how it worked for I mean you know I I had a good relationship so naturally I was listening when pro game I'm not I'm saying I Can't believe that there's there's some that really cares about the country and\nHe went running for president he doesn't worry you worried about what the world is going to get from us wants to be president for the people\nWell that's why I say I I'm dead serious none of this stuff would be happening if anybody else would have won this election I mean ... nothing like this\nI mean it gets refresh UC unemployment going down you see a guy that's at least have some business mentality to say let's lower corporate taxes make them more competitive and the benefits that come from that and cutting regulation\nAnd for dealing with these trade agreements I mean just to ... or even meet nice before it was an office don't you remember when he called all the CEOs and he was ... saying listen there are consequences if they leave the country\nYou're talking about that let me say something I I um\nYeah I Love this car I'm driving at some work but it was made in Korea I couldn't find any sport utility has made me in a small one that I can afford and but I Lived up saying but you know what I heard I was looking at some news about they're going to redesign twenty twenty and I was reading on a blog it was a gamble on them they said\nThe what can you tell me if I spend the clock back the personal satisfaction that you get\nOut of going out and when when you would go out and meet with clients and they would put these windows in in the feedback that you would get about energy savings or about the appearance of the house I mean when you were on the road and you still do some of that can you tell me what that did ... did for you because I mean\nWe we thoroughly enjoy getting out in the community I was out of the October fest Mormon rotary October fest couple of weeks ago\nAnd people would come up to me we had a little stand that to come up to me and they were so happy with us you know if they had a problem we were out there to take care of it if they had a shield failure piece of broken glass whenever the issue was\nAnd people would stand there and and just you know literally praise us for what we've done what we've done for them and how are they enjoy it the noise factor was reduced right off the bat that is the first thing we hear\nEverything got so quiet and I don't hear anything from the outside and then my gas bills went down my electric bills when ... when does operate twelve months out of the year\nDo you ever hear people talking about how you see a A R to clean and this kind of stuff I mean aren't women into that\nWe here at all they don't have to hire people they don't have to get ladders enough on second or third floor\nDoes that still give you a charge to this day does without a doubt it and and you hear often from people let's say I just think I was treated fairly and with respect\nWell we hear that all the time people absolutely love\nDealing with us because we are a no no nonsense company right everything is upfront everything is on a contract everything's spelled out our prices are right there you can pick and choose what you want to do\nEverybody else's buy one get one free or you know there's nothing free today these manufacturers don't give us a thing as a BS it's all baloney a\nSo consequently when people deal with us and they come back to us to say thank goodness we had we had a A R sales one of our designers up in Cleveland sold a lady or about eleven windows\nThe company who had been in there in contracted it make a long story short we were like five thousand dollars under this company for a living windows and the woman says now my gracious that money's going into my child's college fund she was so happy\nBut doesn't that give you a thrill and hire that kind of stuff but I I I Know you as a person deep down\nDeep down despised somebody that was taken advantage of somebody like that that that bothers you and then when we when you guys go out now I just was going to cut back do you ever say you know what when this person says well I Want to take a double hung out or put this out and put a bay or bowling here", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "12"}
