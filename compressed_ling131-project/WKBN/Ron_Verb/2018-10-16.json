this afternoon 'til six o'clock seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven and\nTo see what folks have to say uh as far as not just national politics and Trump I've spoken to numerous times about that and that's why I said ah basically I'm going to do a take do whatever's are your thoughts through your comments you might have here\nAfternoon I mean uh you know as far as I'm concerned and we've talked about a numerous times a a there's a ... for whatever reason a lot of people think that if you like Trump you're ... you're a nut job or a weird or something like that and I make no apologies for quite frankly I like Trump is president I think the guy's doing a great job\nAh I'm I find it very refreshing I find it I find everything about him refreshing I find his fulfilling his campaign promises refreshing\nI remember sitting down and roll and radio at the southern part mall when Bill Clinton came to town and so basically told us allies left and never fulfilled any of that kind of stuff\nYou know they come into town and act like they really give a damn about people losing their jobs as a result of these trade deals act like they really care and\nAll that kind of stuff and once they leave they totally forget about it and they do absolutely no follow through so I watched that first hand well over the years ah when when he came to town and it wasn't him when Dan Quayle was in town or when he was vice presidents but I've been to a lot of that kinda stuff and it's just like uh I I just\nI reached a point where I got tired so tired of allies just so tired of allies\nAnd I really am convinced that many of these people are just totally and completely out of touch with what is going on and our society it'll it interests me or what amazes me is that a guy that's worth substantial money from New York\nAs a better understanding of what was taking place in Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan than the the rest of these politicians\nOh well the guy from New York City was more in touch and could see what was going\nOn out there [noise]\nLike I told you before that's why I voted for Ross Perot why you I totally agree with everything he got in a debate on Larry King live if you've been around long enough with Al Gore\nAnd Al Gore won the debate but guess what he might have won the debate but Ross Perot was right everything he said that would happen is sucking sound the stagnant wages the decline of the middle class\nLousy GDP everything that Ross Perot predicted would happen with these trade agreements\nThat's exactly what happens so everything he predicted that's what happened [noise]\nAnd that's why I voted for him so Al Gore might've been a little more savvy in a debates but\nHe was wrong\nWell for the same reasons that I voted for parole or the same reasons that I voted for Donald Trump and frankly I find them refreshing\nEither just don't think Hillary Clinton or any of the other politicians would have accomplished any of this stuff that we're seeing take place I don't think they would have done a damn thing you would add TPP now these trade deals would have been negotiated because they're influenced by politics and lobbyists and getting reelected and special interest\n\nSomeone Trump got elected and then I see this constant and when you're not agree every week it's always something or or Russian thing it's Stormy Daniels it's ah it's always something that they're trying to put them down with\nA I mean and I'm just sitting there thinking he died just every one of these bullets\n\nAnd he just continues to do fulfilling campaign promises do a good job in a country seems to be doing well as a result of it no not as a Democrat or Republican but it's an American I find that refreshing gee you're actually\nDoing what you said you would do\n\nWith the deals that we're not in the best interest of the United states when you go ... and you're actually doing something about that you're calling CEOs and you're telling them you know don't be leaving the country you're putting tariffs down near the economy's doing quite well unemployment's down we haven't heard from ISIS\nIs really why a lot of people want these jobs\nBut that's what I'm trying my best in all sincerity to get you to change maybe you're thinking to say stop voting Democrat or Republican start voting results\n\nTwo of the biggest issues on state front facing your community here our community here so the gasoline tax divided by eighty eight counties not by road miles we got a lot of road miles in this county we should be getting more than counties that have fewer road miles\nNot a single state representative has done a damn thing to change that NATO one\n\nNow you hear all these politicians complaining about the rainy day fund not a single one of these guys that you've been electing has done a damn thing to change that\nNot a thing no results zero those are the two most important issues facing our communities are schools\nYeah John ... cherries going to talk about e caught and all this other stuff and who cares the two most important issues that are raising your taxes you know it's always a monitor that they use\n\nOr those two things in each state reps haven't done a damn thing about them\nAnd they've been there\nSo my mentality is law try someone else and see if they can do anything and if they fail\nThen you get rid of them they said oh I'm a try someone else must send somebody down and see what they can do\nThey don't want to talk about Dave Simon run over against Hagen I Can't take anything she's done other and collect a paycheck you keep it in a family after Bob Hagan went away Gen done anything\n\nSo I Know Dave Simon go down there and he would just be Illinois a living hell out of them but you get something done\nI Know that\nI'll take my chances with a micro Rowley see what he can get done first he's coming out of the private sector is a good on the school board that's an understanding of private business I'll take a shot at that what do I got to lose I've been getting such mediocre crap at this point in time\n\nAnd I'm wearing out with the old John but Sheri campaign you know like you know ... ... what's the running on that he's in the military and he has five kids\nWhy don't you actually run on this is what I've done all the reality is the two most important issues you haven't done anything on them zero\n\nI mean seriously the two most important things nothing Michelle up Oregon two most important things nothing ... Simon wanted to try and Michael rolling I mean just from my perspective and then maybe all these guys coming at me trying to get into my wallet all the time maybe this is nonsense of stop\n\nMaybe or maybe we can get some better fiscal responsibility ask yourself the question I'm asking knowing where your taxes are now where will they be five years from now there'll be ignorance\nWhere will they be\nFor your adult children in ten years you ever think of that\n\nWe are so dangerously close to where government wouldn't be taking more of your money then you will be keeping because there's a mentality that we should have to pay for everything and every body\n\nIssue too with an increase more your money police loving in Austin Town with an increase more your money\n\nLess of your money you'll have and government will have more of it less severe money to pay your bills plan for your future\nEnjoying the fruits of your labor\nIs government trying to do too much has it gotten too big as it simply gotten too expensive\n\nThat's why I Want you to know what this judge pays another part time job Seventy plus thousand with full benefits and retirement\n\nLike state rep sixty thousand fold benefits in retirement ... there's a reason why these people are running for a lot of this but the reason why you should vote for him is are they doing anything for you or they succeeding are are they are earning their paycheck and did that people are that are running do they know what it's like to sign the front\nOf the check\nInstead of just back do they know what that's like\n\nA take some calls seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven uh Gary ... telling you hello\nHey we're on a um [noise] he's talking about these people to launch illegals V.

I Would like these guys to actually have like a private sector business I Would like these guys to actually do to work in the private sector more 'cause I don't think they have a damn clue to\nRemind me aware that's ... that's all they're donor given money away they have no idea what it takes to art\nAnd I know it's just too easy to say well you know the answer like I say the answer can't be we need to take more of your money the answer needs to be\nWhy haven't you guys solve the problems you keep complaining about not keeping in mind governor case it gets made it clear he says I'm sick of local officials whining about the rainy day fund their piston too much money away they need to tighten their belts I mean that's my comment sets a governor from Ohio saying it's\nWhat you're doing your household wearing your ... star cricketer our order and you realize oh\nWe're in a fiscal emergency I hear your start ... your ... your turn your air conditioner ... garner he drowned you're given a little a Harvard for America Carter save your money on some of those expand for your ... to live in our house all of our soldiers affairs\nNow and you just start rounding our local government as a fear of there's this kind of put their hand out every time you turn around and and that's just one I got a ... year and I I Love your show\nThank you and I agree totally with your statement\nCompletely agree with what that guy said and that's but ah but you don't see that happening I'd vote for that guy\nI'd go vote for him because I think he could do a better job than a lot of these guys but see for these people it's ... they view this is their job well this is how they\nAh you know they get there a paycheck and their benefits and they view it as their job they don't view it as\nUm\nWell it's just about getting his keeping that job and keeping that paycheck\nIt becomes too much about them and not about accomplishing anything or at least from my perspective\nAnd that's and that's unfortunate for all of you doesn't matter to me whether you're a Republican or Democrat doesn't matter to me or any of that kind of stuff as long as you're a productive member of society\nThat is I'm not a you know it's not a taker but pay or if you're if you're that I think you I think a lot of you really get it\n\nAnd I ... a gym others oak whether you're in what I'm saying you know as I sit here in\n... Ohio on Tiffany boulevard it applies to those who you are listening out an Akron or Cleveland or Pittsburgh or any of those outlying areas as well what I'm saying is and even though a lot of this stuff is local it's still applies to your\nParticular situation as well I don't care where you are\nJust because I'm not necessarily sitting in your community doesn't mean the same thing doesn't apply that's why I asked a generic question if you can't think of what they've done and vote for somebody else don't you think there are already taken enough for your money that's why I ask all of these questions do you think the answer to everything is throwing more money at it\n\nLike ... and the the guy that the c._e._o. of Youngstown schools who was throwing a towel and when his contract is up\nI said when they brought him in the town I ... I I watch all these administrators and superintendents not a damn one of a made a bit of difference and they all promised do everything was going to change out to ... all of them\nAnd my argument was the same until you have students who want to learn parents to see their kids go to bed on time do their homework value education until you have that parental involvement I don't give a damn who you bring in or what you pay and they're not going to be able to fix the school system until you restore discipline\nUntil you restore a expectations and until you do all of that it's nothing's going to change\nNothing is going to change I don't care who you bring in to run the operation it's the students and the parents that are the problem\nBut we keep thinking well if we hire this guy or\nWe pay this guy this guy probably do a better job and it's never worked and it never will work I mean that's\nThat's the problem with the you know this ... and I was saying well he's throwing a towel in now hire someone else you think anyone else is going to be more successful with all the money they pay you might as well get somebody you honestly says listen until this whole\n\nChanges we're not going to fix any of this stuff that's in general what I'm trying\nSo keep that in mind let me talk about something pleasant for a second to take more calls seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven I'm babbling a lot today but I feel good to get off my chest I really do and I'm Glad you're listening and taking it all in because ah\nYou see where they see natural gas prices are going to go up there's actually a a short supply of natural gas and they're saying we want right from eating a or air conditioning season right into kind of heating season so he'll be locked into a good rates loaded like thirty eight tomorrow size forty eight sixty percent chance of showers thirty four furlough forty\nEighth ...
