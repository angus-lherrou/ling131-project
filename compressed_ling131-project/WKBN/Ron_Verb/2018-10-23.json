McNally a woman who I interviewed before\nPeople are going to end up with hundreds of dollars of waste water bills city councilman Lauren McNally and she's absolutely right when they're talking forty percent increase because you're sore bill already is is I think high\nEspecially 'cause they can't meet her at their meter your sewer billed as a you know directly on your water bill you know you can go wash your car and you're still paying for the watch all that water down to sue\nCorrect correct\nIf it doesn't seem like a good deal and the number saying forty percent that's not a true number because the true number is it forty eight percent every year and a present on top of that for five years\nRight so it's actually higher than forty percent yeah see I like ... percent I didn't realize that the mayor ... times pretty smart guy he says now it'd be in it he took the words out of my mouth I was feeling smart well see you're not that smart you know I can tell by talking to you you know you're not you're not quite there\nI'm I'm working on it though are a tiger ... then you got All right thanks Larry's on a cell phone use radio five Seventy do what he gave me an hello Lawrence\nOr hello good afternoon yeah in the mirror is on the right track but just didn't quite get there are some that they need money they'll take that shifted when the increase in ... so if you start with the base of a hundred\nAnd eight dollars to it that's a hundred and eight this year and a part of the increase was a hundred dollars creatures or a hundred and eight now if you had\n... percent five times on top of that is a total of six eight percent increases grand total works out you and I don't have a drum for and drum roll but it's one fifty sixty yes\nIs more than a forty percent increase\n[noise] yeah I mean don't you think that that's an astronomical increase see here's my argument that I then I making for people I don't know anyone's income they can keep up with this kind of stuff\nAs I said before I I don't know in my house I run it from the government because my property taxes keep going up every stinking year\nYou know all of this stuff passes the police levy the issue to levy my property taxes will go up a couple hundred a year at least\nI mean think about that in one year I'm already over four thousand now what ... what else are we going to put on a property next year so that we can say well it's a it's a around all with an increase in a blink of it I ... I can go from four thousand a forty five hundred you see what I'm saying there's no end in sight\nTo the answer being we need to take more of your money there is no end in sight to that\nA ... whatsoever when it comes to\nYour residence ... on on that in all seriousness that's what I'd ... that's what I admire about the mayor in large town because you know he's doing this with an income tax out there putting that money back into his residents to ... to service them so that they are so that it pays for sewer lines in gas lines\nI mean he he he says he thinks of his constituents first my your representatives they could care less they just think the answer always says we need to take more of your money that's it there's no other answer you need to pay more that's the end of it we can't help\nBut we do we we couldn't negotiate when we dropped the ball and screwed up this deal with Hollywood gaming it was supposed to pay the township every year we messed it up but uh oh well\nYou know you're going to start making ... smaller pocket that's all\nThere you have it there you have it\nYou know and and that kind of stuff is what burns me up like I say I'm Garrett\nWas talking about a P. A. mandates and race in east rates back when I'm Garrett was mayor what we've had rate increases all that time where's all that\nMoney God oh that's right it went to economic development so that guy could have is lavish lifestyle or that they want the money to\nPi duck\nI think the things that can be a very difficult right now in the sense that if they do in the way then we have a cash for that you know we would be ... but I think that Trump is on the right track by saying that\nHe should yeah a stop to eat my point is\nWhy don't we send them a bill but having to stop them so these are bad people they should have gone out of their border just like we go out of a gaffe chaos and lay or anywhere else we have to fit and proper documentation that we are leaving the country\nAnd again when we went to the country so this bishop listened to them that you are now that I'm not to rise and create here they're your citizens it's your problem\nWe cannot really be the banquet\nYeah say yes\nWhat do you think about what ... what do you think Trump needs to do when these people get close to the border this is a big it this is a big problem\nI think those who are currently do fifty years of age there should be either\nSo it's as simple as that this is an invading armies with their own countries flag and other countries flag when people start conveyed the a barter\nIt is it is invasion ... asking for let's deal with it as it is a being done so they should because they should be done whatever it takes\nFor them to know and I mean next time we'll be uncomfortable or if he just treat them nicely than there is coming\nSo any man of the edge and other people have made a good point that I won't repeat but about the no ... percent increase that that have already pointed out the wound is called the wound up Seventy two\nIf you want to find out how long that they're the\nNumber to double you divide the percentage is the last seven to ... by the percentage so but at ten percent a rape and seven years the number ... at eight percent in nine years the number of that is the compound the magic of compounding that starts to double very quickly\nAbsolutely absolutely already done but I Want to\nThank you met radio five Seventy nobody can be done three fifty one here in the afternoon\nGo to a Conrad you're on me or hell other Conrad\nHi how are you good sort of go

making a good point already Conrad go ahead\nLast night in his speech and used and he indicated he hired over four million people\nSince he's been in office I'm now if that most of those jobs are worth sixty grand a show on average and Social Security even though we pay seven points ... show and what\nAbout six percent of that goes to our Social Security if you take six percent of sixty thousand that's three hundred and sixty dollars\nA a a an employer will mark that up the same amount that seven hundred and twenty dollars so you take a a million people that seven hundred and twenty million dollars that they collect for every million people that they are so um he's hard\nFor a million and that's over three billion dollars right there now he's your people that are unemployed at the beginning of the year that country knew how many people have to be\nOn Social Security show this is all extra money and most of them are probably younger people because older people have their jobs\nSo if Trump came up and caged full employment for the eight years and he's in there he's going to rack up fifty sixty million dollars and it goes on forever it also takes care of Medicare 'cause that's part of the extra beyond the amount they put away for Social Security\nAnd I don't know why the Trump people don't take advantage of this but\nWe're solving the problems now he's building up a surplus that's money were not touching\nAnd none of the Democrats that you know all they want to do is figure out ways to tell us how they're suffering and they want to take it away from us the Republicans can take advantage is is this and say well we're out there\nWe're starting to take care of Social Security because we're hiring people and the long term answer to Medicare and Social Security is full employment\nAbsolutely absolutely that's what Trump said biking keep GDP of four or five percent a lot of problems go away thank you for your call I'll be back after the news\nHere in time man or a clock more anti go boring to bear brothers dot com they use radio five seven WCBS young down [noise]\nAll right I I don't think it's going to be as a I think it's a huge dilemma that the

to the mid term to one of the band in his constituents\nAnd go away from one of his key points getting elected I Would imagine he would have to hold his ground and that's probably what the Democrats
