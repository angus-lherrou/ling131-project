to me now are visionary\nBecause they were trying to warn me that they were warning me hey is this segment of our society grows is the character of our people grow that basically become a they don't want to do anything they want to become freeloaders so they don't want to be responsible contributing citizens to society\nAs that grows they become a voting bloc that you'll have politicians cater to because they're more interested in getting their votes\nAre in getting elected than they are what's in the best interest of the country I can remember these guys saying that at the time and lo and behold\nIt's a city or in two thousand Eighteen I reflect on those guys saying they're back then and and they're absolutely right\nIt is why in part yesterday I I was talking about and I sincerely am troubled by by this and that's why I Try to bring it out yesterday when I was talking about\nMonthly expenses that it's that folks have and that's why I don't want people to be ignorant of it and that's why I say you know I have a adult children that are twenty six and ... twenty and older ones too and say you know I keep saying to myself well we're if property taxes are where they are now for me where are these going to be\nWhen my adult children are forty years old I mean I can easily see them being eight thousand dollars for a regular house you know and and uh\nThat's uh I'm just not kidding you know what I mean I can see I'm going in that direction you know like if you live in Austin township in countryside or spring meadow or you live in a [noise]\nA ... to reserve for circle area you live in any of those type of developments\nThat I could easily see your property taxes going through the roof as as time goes on and that's why I Want to talk about property taxes are kind of separate board men in Austin Town because they have the highest middle age and I'm going to get into explaining that in future shows the highest middle age\nAre in the county and ah so it already means you're paying a ton now\nYou have the highest percentage in the county versus other areas where they might be able to pass issues because they're not paying nearly as much in middle age as Austin ... townships are so you know things are very specific to specific communities or if you will based on that\nBut I don't know you know that's why make the argument I don't know\nUh you know as I've said do you guys before my property taxes in a joke Koch construction home in Austin Town and now four thousand dollars over four thousand a year\nIn with with what I see every year and in Austin city I don't care if you love a library nuts they waste a lot of money I mean Twenty one million dollars to remodel the downtown library they have so much\nMoney coming in from that property tax levy they don't know what to do with it all and when they stop remodeling and building libraries are going to be be welded with what to do with all this money just to say you know when people pass that oh I Love the library and I'll vote for it well they they've got tons them more money and they know what to do with that money that's taken out of every taxpayers pockets\nAnd taken out of their pockets so that you don't have ... it's your money what I Try to explain to people is it's your money\nAnd they they're taking so much of it out of your money out of your pocket they don't know what to do with it all well to me it's it's like well ... they're not going to give it back to you to put it back in your pocket so that you can enjoy the fruits of your labor that's what I Try to convince you guys that whether you're a Democrat or Republican it should have stayed in your pocket\nLikewise cycling W. R. T. and went with this forever sales tax\nAnd I and I try to say listen they are the if the economy improves which it is doing with sales through the trumps years\nThat's an I ... that just generates tons more money than it was originally generating\nWhen it was passed they'll have so much money they won't know what to do with it all everybody get gold plated benefits gold plated retirement all this kind of stuff because of the additional money that you're paying\nSee my goal is to just get you to think for a minute you know just because somebody says we we need this or we need that doesn't mean it's the truth doesn't mean they're fiscally responsible\nDoesn't mean that they're stretching your tax dollars as well as they should be I sincerely mean to all of you I I Believe your tax dollars are a limited resource\nAnd I believe too much of your money is being taken away from you and too much of it as being wasted\nAnd ... and we're not frugal enough to see how it is being spent currently it doesn't matter to a lot of these people because it's not their business it's not their money\nThat they they're like oh Bolivia's to it it's just it's a it's a different mentality from it if it's if if it's your money\nYou know for example if a you can often see it if their dad you know I could tell when I went to college when their dads are paying for it and it didn't matter they didn't try as hard to drop out of classes 'cause their dad was paying for it was his money versus the kids that we're paying for it out of their pocket\nAnd you know when you're paying for it when it's your coming out of your pocket it's all different\nYou know a lot of times kids grow up and when they get their own home all of a sudden they're turning the lights off more often than they ever did when they live with their parents because now they get the electric bill\nOr or or their turn in the air conditioner or you know up a little bit because now they're getting the electric bill it all changes when you're when you're the one paying the bills and writing checks or if you're in business or even running a household\nIt's troubling ... the reports that I read where it all sincerity the vast majority of households out there are living paycheck to paycheck the vast majority\nOf households out they're living paycheck to paycheck so what does that mean have you seen the surveys a lot of people don't have five hundred to a thousand dollars in savings\nThey don't have five hundred to a thousand dollars in savings so if they have a major car repair they don't know what to do if they have a you know a major medical issue or with even with insurance to Dr ... they don't have the money\nNow some of this has to do with the fact that they don't make very much money to begin with they might make ten eleven twelve Thirteen dollars an hour and you take all the taxes out and then it's makes it damn near impossible to save you know so that's why you have two people working in households trying to make ends meet [noise] see I'm a\nFirm believer that what makes it so difficult for why is everybody working so hard let me rephrase that I think that's because the government is taking so much of your money I think that's why\nEveryone is working so hard that's productive because government is taking too much of your money they're wasting\nToo much of it in your politicians are are good stewards of it to be frugal and watching it as they should\nWhat does that mean negotiating realistic healthcare benefits like are in the private sector realistic ones\nUh the the grossly different from the public sector the private sector the retirements are nowhere close and you know obviously you can retire at sixty two or sixty six sixty seven\nIn the private sector in the private sector you got to be sixty five before you get healthcare coverage for the most part there are exceptions that to General Motors me in one of them but I don't know how long General Motors is ever going to be able to go on with that either um\nSo you got to be sixty five before you can get your Medicare\nBut that isn't the case if you're in the government sector well you have Thirty years in twenty five years in where you can retire now\nSo you know if you're the government you have a ... that's what I see of a better retirement you can get your health care benefits much sooner you don't have to wait till you're sixty five you're probably a better hospitalization\nAnd at the end none of this stuff seems to change\nVery much\nWhat has done over the years in the private sector so the answer always is let's take more money from the private sector\n... denies crashed between and pick up and talk to them motor cycle that killed a man in Lawrence has been ruled the hit scan the driver

good Italian out all together with a with when you look at just the taxes in general I I really do sit here and I think to myself I Can't I Want you to think about this all of you guys to think about this whether you agree disagree or whatever [noise] I Can't imagine\nWhat my point that I Want to make is what do you think property taxes are going to be on whatever home if you own a home what do you think they're going to be in five years or ten years at the pace that we're going with the constant increases in this community with everybody tagging on or or taxes in general\nI mean what do you think and that's what you have to think about you know if I'm complaining about how high they are now\nWhat are they win ten years from now for my adult children gonna be astronomical I mean you are very easily could see six hundred dollar a month property tax payments and this is insanity\nIs so so that's that's why I say we we have to start thinking about this kind of stuff\nAnd ... it depends it depends where you live 'cause a lot it's based on military some areas that are that have lower property taxes and so uh you know there you could afford to say well I'm going to vote for this because you have a lower property tax or perhaps you have something you know I'm not saying that ... that means you vote on every tax down because you don't\nBut um you have to assess it based based on that but my point being if I'd go one step further from what I'm saying when it comes to that I mean when I get these type of emails all the time from people\nI mean because my focus has is is on the homeowner first not governments see it's with the with these elected representatives their their their their goal is to get reelected they want to keep their position\nLike for ... they want to keep their position keep that paycheck keep that gold plated benefits I don't care if you're a trustee or whatever\nYou know they're they're not public servants it's all about them and they want to get reelected they want to get get the money coming in and they want the benefits\nThat is what it's really all about the focus for them isn't on the homeowner\nIt's always what we understand but we understand but\nThere's never of I've looked over this entire budget and here's where we've been wasted money have you ever heard that from any of them I've looked at over and let me tell you about the health care package that our employees get\nLet me tell you about the retirement that they get let me tell you about how you know much overtime is person gets or how how we're really pissed away a lot of your money\nIn every year that do ya\nTherein lies the problem because the focus is on the tax payer the homeowner it becomes a click mentality it'd become as well I'm not you know it almost becomes the people at work for the thing I Want to vote the same people in because they want to keep the system going\nSo it almost becomes government against citizen\n\nYou know that's why I say when it comes to issue too that's deceptive I don't give a damn what the law says it's deceptive is say it's a run all within increase it as a ball face deceptive lie you will pay more and I'm a guy that saying you're already paying enough\n\nSo that's a I mean that's the point that I'm trying to make on some of this stuff so that's point number two\nPoint number two is\nThat and I see this all the time I mean they're they're Democrats elected to office\nComplaining about these two state issues and they support the same Democrats that have been there forever who've done nothing about those two issues\nAn out of the ... you know what you said that one time that it really stuck with me when you said um you know your house is paid for [laughter] forever if\nYou're running it from the government I'm Serious you know that you're running it from the government\nPay for right on the budget will make this ... you know more and more and you've got to believe some of these people are losing their home over over the you\nKnow I ... what what I Know from where I sit here today just from what I Know how many people are ... are walking away from bank a bankruptcy dead on credit cards sorry just on credit cards are walking away from that they are what\nI the I I Know what I Know what's going on out there I mean ... to look ... look people don't have five hundred to a thousand dollars in savings into bankruptcy on credit card debt is through the roof\nAnd it's really a among the people running and and it always amazes me they know what their last name is like gr very just\nLike ... and it's the end it thickening to think about Seventy five percent of the people go to these old\nRight and the the and vote for him name\nThey know and that they're voting or without who if they've done\nWell back in time it shouldn't be about Democrat or Republican should be about is this person earning other and collect the pay check what does this person doing for you that should be the question you should ask yourself every time you go to vote for anybody\nAnd it was because of\nThat a couple of these I'm speaking engagements and they were talking back when I was going against Hillary and I kept I kept asking if you want to have that is that she was a well she has our kids I got a hard a lot of stuff\nYeah but ... and ... what was said listen to this so what does that mean you know I mean you're you're you're you're you got a heart for kids you got kids doesn't everybody have a heart for kids to be searched cliches that mean nothing that's Sarah\nCalling Ralph yes you've got away with ... years on my mind right newly map things right\nAnd this is why this this is the president or not people are tired of it right\nAnd I'm telling people self savor your taxes\nYou know I Do it every time that comes up it's telling me it's worth is make it worth that if if you're selling my land versus than good I should be able to go to the bank and get that and I like them all the time and I live in a lot\nOf just let 'em right things your hat and not just sit back and let that happen\nBut yet but I'm Serious when I say can you imagine if based on what it is now any of you listening what is it going to be ten years from now\n[laughter] I mean it's it's incredible actually name of that or your rent\nThere if there if you if it really does very well and there's other areas you can move to the the so within a county that have less millage but without being ... with well let me just leave it at that thank you Tom appreciate it news radio five Seventy

because you get it\nNow there is a state issue it took seven hundred thousand people to sign that get the stupid thing for a state issue how Supreme Court said long time ago it's illegal the way we find schools was our tax nothing's changed\nSo why don't we go out and get seven hundred thousand people to put her on there and say hey no more no more real estate taxes sales tax something else but not real estate taxes you get that many people with all the people that you have a real estate I bet you they vote for us\nThey get so much money coming in and give you free rides and W.

twenty Nineteen where\nYou're going to have to pay fifty percent of they'll pay fifty percent of the membership fee\nA shirt and fitness centers mhm that of course is not good because of some folks are on a limited budget so they either give us ... three three zero some five eight forty one sixty three or toll free eight seven seven\nEight six six to nine five because we have Medicare supplement that will include shellfish diggers\nAnd then go guys in the sand that say in their form and that they are finally for weeks\nAnd that that's often don't need that for health care I go to another Fifteen million dollars that's even get anywhere you know to accept the same that attention but yeah I never give gunmen things to do that counted making good out of windows unless we have them\nLying by lying but this is what\nYou're describing this far back as the public should being opened that you can see why that is and if the Allegra D. yeah just cause that that's fine but nine out of ten times you say I can get it done from one end of this price and in fact the fact that\nSo that they need to be\nA man ... right and and ... that's what I liked about Trump when he said that any other president would have said oh build Airforce one what do I care he said no that's ridiculous\nSo we have to do it in a letter on is to\nWrite the right correct\nMe we should not let them say okay this is a bit better for what justifies\nMolested by they even have to be done by you and secondly how can you charge eight hundred dollars for a lot I can understand\nThat that sense you know let's eight hundred dollars\nSo that comes a point that only how does how does shine and night on these things will say that because the Arctic neither do completely that they can call but because they can hide it you don't ever know about it actually happened\nCorrect correct All right thank you Dr Rick in Youngstown news radio find somebody to carry an hello\nHey how are you going are they good sir good hey\nMy first question here there are probably for the high ... how do we justify your property taxes\nBy by the the ... every appraisal it they do in ... and redo every six to seven years supposedly\nOkay here's why am I paid for it I have a house or work\nMuch with my neighbors but I put in your garage sale and your driveway and I bought my outside of San bucks for nine hundred dollars a year I did these things\nAnd my property tax doubles on me and my neighbor's got a better guards that are houses and there's still paying eight nine hundred dollars a year for how they justified as fair\n\nWell I don't I don't know what you can do is uh is uh\n[noise] you know you shouldn't you you should probably take a look at ... or the homes comparable if their comparable you could challenge at does think that's a to first of the year you'd have to call Ralph ... office and ask him to process to challenge at and then you go up there with comparable she wouldn't just go up there in\nAnd say like you're talking to me you would say well here's one of my neighbors property taxes are in his square footage is the same as yours and take some pictures wire mine higher and go up and me and make your case or potentially pay somebody to do an appraisal and take that with you as well that would be my recommendation for you if you feel that that's the case\nYeah it was like I had to go ... says I got a bill\nRight they they got me right\nRight ... it's a disincentive almost for you improving your property\nYeah it is a word border\nRight right it'd be it'd becomes a disincentive that really does\nYeah but I have one more thing these schools\nWant all the thought that we have a full time and area I live in a lot of families they probably don't get practice at home and we all these all have to give us a call so they go to school and they won't fact\nAnd many of them get subsidized or free lunch to\nWrite in some cases the kids thought because your parents got a little drop it and they watch for that\nWell let me put it this way my kids never got anything from anybody I always had to pay everything [laughter] is it\nRight but there's a couple of cases the kids I Know that\nTheir parents have to pay for lunch for the primary count whether account round low and uh probably like ab parents ... ... dollars you know under they say oh the school for lunch wrote a kid goes gets breakfast and why they get they get into the house and they give them you\nKnow that\n... might have been the only means that can call the parents saying hey we need for money here for let's see if your kid when your parents have that car right when you're getting all these ... and ... fast mhm smart\nWell I I I mean we are there there's there's definite who you know I assume people are adult enough to know that they are going to have to pay taxes for the bunch of roads cloud and all this kind of stuff that there's a cost all of that\nAre in this isn't about not paying taxes it's about you're paying too much already my point is well live two points you're paying too much already too much of your money isn't Cisco isn't watched properly\nYou know I Believe your property you're all your taxes should be viewed as a as a cherished resource I don't think that that's the mentality that's being used\nOr with it and I think that we are out of control with how much money we're taking from people in Texas at all levels for example you were ... you were punished for improving your property\nWell so what's the lesson well hell I shouldn't have done any of this stuff and then I Would have been better off so what what what your property decay\nThis was stupidity that's going on I mean this is just the the the ... stupidity of of what's happening\nYeah it's a good tax it's fair ways on that out I did\nYeah it's not a ... I just think we got it I I'm ...

I understand I I get it how much are you on Social Security yet how much do you get a month to listen to those folks it's ... it's not that much\nWell good for the whole again we're talking Floyd and the thing about it we paid\nFor my show and we have and they fall into Social Security ... percent right for our own hot facing\nA we never had that effect it that way my\nChoice to correct it you know he we were in tracking\nThat if people complain about when you're asked them to take a cat or whatever it might not\nLike I I just during the break I went I looked\nOut of my paycheck per month comes eight hundred roughly eight hundred dollars for my hospitalization coverage for my family for my um long term and short term disability for my health savings account and all that kind of stuff\nFor my vision and dental eight hundred dollars a month that's just the portion every month that comes out of my check that I pay ... and ... and the company then is paying a ... you know they're paying two thirds so they're paying back sixteen hundred about how ... probably not that much how\nI might be hit paying half of it if you think it's probably about sixteen hundred a month\nBut so in all reality where is healthcare going as far as the cost healthcare coverage going\nMy buddy Jeff was telling me I mentioned is the other day on the air he's paying twelve hundred dollars a month in fact he's a self employed guy ... years old\nWith a five thousand dollar deductible and I said think about that of what you're paying Fifteen thousand dollars a year out of your pocket for healthcare coverage than another friend that I Know\nThey're paying Seventeen hundred dollars a month with a five thousand dollar to the doctor will these numbers are asked that just for health insurance plus\nIf you use it you're paying all this money or hundreds every time you use it because it hopefully it doesn't kick in 'cause you're not sick thinking all the money that is and you haven't bought\nA liquor groceries you have a failure electric bill you haven't done a damn thing\nHere is that going to be in five years you know this is why I Love Trump and I'm all are among the Trump drainage done a great job and I want them to you I Want these guys to figure out this healthcare coverage Medicare for all this and the answer because\nYou'd have to triple taxes so I I don't know what the answer to this problem is but it is suffocating\nIndividual small businesses and you know let's be realistic here plumber your carpenter's you know ... there's a lot of small businesses out there\nThe auto repair shops and that it has suffocating small businesses the cost of health care and frankly uh the uh the auto companies and huge companies like this is a huge huge expense well what's it going to be five years from now\nWell I think it's a it's like you were saying if they go in and I I'm not saying that they are all money they they don't know what the common man standing on things\nAnd they had and now they can't get by and I think it's it's terrible and Trump if it got it thinking like that and I don't know\nWhy don't you don't you see that in and I I mean I'm a hundred percent satisfied with President Trump big mistake but don't you what I find ideas\nThat you know the Democrats don't like it when you refer to their mob mentality that they've been doing that they don't like that and it is a mob mentality and you know when Hillary Clinton says well you can't you can't be civil to these people I I think I think you know remember\nThe FBI guy well you know I'm at Walmart I can smell the Trump supporters it it it's a very you know ... what did Hillary call him the degenerates or something I forget what she called them I I you know Hillary with the ... what she called them then you had that FBI guy talking about him at Walmart and smell the Trump supporters and then you can hear Hillary Clinton say well I Can't be civil\nTalking about people with their nose up in the air at their fellow Americans\nAnd you know you're looked down on your look down on if you support Trump and a lot of people to support Trump don't say anything about it I support Trump\nIf you want to look down on me for that I don't care I'm like what he's doing I'm pleased with what he's doing I find it refreshing and I find those people who don't like it or look down on it I think they're just wrong and I don't much care for their party and how it's acting\nLaugh at it and I agree with you I worry right now with the stock market that\nGot the you know these things will work themselves they're highs and lows you got to listen Monday Night when John Arnold's on at six o'clock because\nI'm going to speculate I'm thinking John is probably thinking this is a

products and Trump has been successful I I've been here I've watched over thirty four years\nDeath by a thousand cuts of what these trade agreements have done to this community in this country\nIt's

I'm a writer on my homeowner's oh I have a riders I have an umbrella policy\nI gotta I'm sure I pay so much for insurance\nBut you know I have all my\nI have some um\nYou know things I put on my ride around my homeowner's right I Do too like jewelry and so forth jewelry yeah my point is\nThe security companies and that's my message to all the people who are listening\nIf you have a serious security company and there's a lot of them out there\nUh make sure every one of your devices work in other words if you have a freeze warning device checking your house or your furnace goes or what are your word for it in a refrigerator shaken by water censor I should've for water but I didn't know how we're maybe there is\nA pill like they have on the white preservative Nelson sets you arm off either no so I didn't check\nAnd put my water gesture and glass of water dry\nYou know what I that's all well and good and that's good advice but I I like what they said why don't you sue the alarm company for three thousand dollars in small claims court see beginning\nIt's ugly then you're only on for eight or five\nRight they're just going to bring this piece of paper I Do and say see it so clearly we're only while a period\nWhen I was in I don't care what the piece of paper says okay you bought a product the product didn't do what is intended to do I I don't know if they can limit their liability like that\nGive it a shot what are you going to lose let's say you get a thousand year thousand ahead\nRight right well the only thing I've done so far left it up on you know better\nRight but I I'm just trying to get you a thousand dollars right now listen to what they said I think that's some good advice you don't want to you know you do and I wish you a lot of luck with that I really do stop you on the floor to enjoy these cold winter break and Ohio why don't why you're leaving All right so\nI Hope that we help somebody that sounds very\nWell thank you very much for your time thank you good luck isn't it kind of sad though in some cases are the costs so much for a lawyer and you can pursue it is he was wrong\nYeah [laughter] well I'm trying to think of this and the shifting over there and [noise] I\nDon't know if there's a consumer sales practices act violation there might be I mean that has\nTo be fit for the purpose for which sold and if you sell it as a as a detection for water\nAnd your problem is I'm work there so this is so when I'm Talking about these are shifting is lily every responsible for legal fees yeah every generally everyone is responsible for the legal fees some statutes in some rules allow you to shift the legal fees to the ... party\nAnd so like in the declare a toy judgment action you could shift fees so\nHe might be able to have the ... the court declared that contract invalid and declare the court that he has to pay and he could shift the fees over but they don't ... shift the fees over he could be out as literally as much as these as these collecting well\nAnd I was just wondering if I had any recourse because I have no proof that they did it I didn't take a picture before yeah the car\nWell unfortunately when you sue someone yeah you have to prove your case about what's called a preponderance of the evidence mhm so unless you know and and your testimony is evidence\nSo if the judge or to believe you buy the preponderance of the evidence you could win the judge doesn't believe you you will lose because without a pitcher something\nElse right or operating witness well you'd ... technically you don't need a cooperating no no you do I'm saying it comes down to credibility who ... more so your testimony would be that the scratch was not there before the car was towed and it was there after\nThey completed the tone and therefore must have occurred while they were throwing it\nWhile they were telling it or why was that the deal is one of the tow truck drivers says why didn't put it in how do you know they didn't put it in the repair shop you know the right All right everybody's going to point the finger ... so it's a tough case okay I think you make the case but not impossible gangs and if they rule against you scratch your judges car that's what I Do\n[laughter] thank you\nThank you good luck [laughter] is that good advice Moses yes scrap the ...

drains it's from the storm it's a ... pump in the basement and it has nothing to do he had an\nAlarm company install a sub pump censor that should have warned him when he was in Florida oh there was water coming in his basement and it didn't Mormon didn't warn him\nRight you should I buy your advice is good he should shut his water off you know try everything in the house when he will no ... no I mean he's just saying that if you get a burst pipe or something like\nThat yeah but the problem with the sub pump is\nIs that when it rains that goes into those trains and then in the ... right\nRight

want to jump in and help working seven days a week sixty hours a week Seventy hours a week or whatever\nWho has custody of the children\n... so I was just wondering because she wants me to leave so she can get assistance and I think that was I was just wondering how by\nSo you have you ever ... what's your first name Monroe have you ever gone to court to established paternity for the children I so you're in a little bit of a quagmire\nHere jeeze\nYeah [laughter] she can make you leave the do you live in an apartment\nOr a house and who bought the house you rented whose name but I'm only it doesn't matter who pays the bills whose names on the lease on ice you can't kick yeah can't kick out of your own lease\nBut she thinks she consuming welfare lottery\nWell here's the situation number one\nI just wonder how much\nIt it depends on what your income is it's not it's not a set amount it's based on your income\nSo far no\nNo no no no no first of all she's not entitled spouse will support because you've never been married and unless it was before Nineteen Ninety One you can't even call it a common law marriage\nYou're only connected through these children\nYou owe a duty of support to the children however because she's unmarried and no corners exercise ... jurisdiction over those children you have no rights to those children therefore not only do you have no rights you have no duty to support so until the paternity establishment\nThat support order will be a ... based upon your income okay if you're under the income threshold if she's under the income threshold\nShe could you know or be qualified to receive government benefits if you have income than you'd be required to pay child support and also make a cash medical payment if you don't have medical insurance for those children\nInsurance for the kids okay good only works like eight hours a week she says she she won't look into her Social Security she says she's afraid she might have to share it\nI'm like I don't want anything from that but you know\nWell you're not married so you're not married so you're not in that you you're not entitled Social Security you don't have any of those issues that come out of American\nShe's on dialysis or kidneys or\nShe's on disability\nBut she has a couple of years I don't get it\nOkay I don't get it either how old are your children\nWell\nIt's not a twelve it's twelve I certainly hope you got cable t._v. instead of it seems like you need something to do it by\nFifteen thirty six they're faking it\nYeah yeah yeah what vitamins are you taking charge just want to confuse the heard of\nThat [laughter] much him\n... never mind I so you don't have to leave the house\nBut if\nYou don't have to leave the house and what he started\nYou know you don't have to leave that the one thing I Would advise though listen please try to avoid any kind of situations that may you know escalate into violence do not make any threats do not\nWhat could happen is and it has happened in the past people will seek a civil\nProtection order to try to get you out of your own home ... alleging that you either threatened them or tried to place them in fear for their safety and it's real easy winner motions are involved\n[noise] so my I Can't well anyways [laughter] right okay good run is better than\nRight and you go exactly by your Monroe is what happens and you know for children without a marriage yeah that establishing paternity ray you're on the air with the attorneys go ahead\nHi thanks for taking my call or make it make a quick okay hey I called last week about [laughter] I bought a a ... and ... right I remember\nOkay I took care of ice and talked to some people and it's not going anywhere for an eye on everything [laughter] [noise]\nAh I talked to do a ... and ... where I bought it and the thing they could [laughter]\nBut ah [noise] but they said it was when I was all wind damage and according to censor done or like what we're supposed to and ... what was the time on a spec make\nSure they told me that\nThey cook company and the company the best they would do is show me the\nPort [noise] for the call I hear that music or an avid call back next week I'm really sorry yeah\nTo think find hard ... brothers song meal can view this as news radio five seven WCBS young [noise]\nUm but with the right approach and with the right professionals you can hear the best that you could possibly\nRight in there and there are the I mean you would agree over your time\nBut just as we've seen televisions get better and cell phones get better hearing aids have gotten dramatically better oh they sure I mean we're getting is close to their getting close to restoring it\nAs you can possibly get they're smaller right they're less conspicuous about what you can't see them as good they're smaller and they perform better and they can be programs specifically for your deficiency\nThey can and honestly the technology that's in them today if that same technology Twenty years ago it probably take a room or close to our room to have that kind of processing speed\nUm but what's most unique about the new technology today as some of the artificial intelligence that's come out with these new sensors and I know ... ... talk to you about that and how you're able to measure different health um parameters as well as\nKnow the uh in that amazing yeah as as well as the er the cerebral stuff\nAnd what it's done is it's brought a hearing aids into the mainstream of conversation and what I mean by that is you know where I fit in fact they have one on right now it's actually a government but I call it a fit fit the crime that's there all the same yeah it's the it's like a Kleenex rain and so you know some of the conversations we had to work\nSome of our our colleagues is hey how many steps of yet it had today you know or you know different like health measurements like that well\nNow with this and this technology being in hearing aids it's brought that conversation into the mainstream\nSo here I Am an audiologist at Centers for hearing care who I I had been asked questions about hearing aids in the past but never like it is today because it's a mainstream conversation people are very interested in what this new technology can do like the fall prevention that's coming out\nIn different things that are going to impact their life in the future and ...\nThere's a couple of things to think about the uh I think one of the biggest changes ... let me just say that should go to the Centers for hearing care the first thing that uh you know what I what I found shocking when I first started interviewing Dr frankly I don't know I found is shocking\nTo do that and I want all of you to listen and understand is because when you when you made the comment and I totally agree it starts with where you go to begin with\nAnd they and it's about there are if if you have you don't have to be an audiologist to do hearing aid you can have a high school diploma I think she said no criminal background\nAnd you can be a salesman so I can be at a big box store and have no medical right an I'm Serious no ... no training for this you know basically at all\nOr they you know that to me is so troubling that that even exist versus you know if I go to my eye doctor Maya doctors ally doctor\nSo when you made that comment and I agree the first thing any of you listening or whether it's your grandparents you or you\nWhen you're going to have your sharing tested or get or or you think your mom or dad or grandparents need a hearing aid the first thing you want to do there are two things make sure these people are audiologist\nAnd ask the Centers for and care of their all audiologist number two did you know what else is important make sure they take Medicare because that's like a guideline the thing that says that they're qualified to\nWrite as audiologist in the state of Ohio a they have to accept ... Medicare that's a real easy way to find out whether or not they're they're audiologist and they're telling the truth and they're telling the truth exactly on his back to what I said it's not just about the device it's about the professional it's more important to have the right professional than the actual device\nProbably because they're going to determine with the right equipment with the right knowledge then where are you hearing loss is as far as that that area that you're lawsuits whether ties are lows right that's the ... where ... you know people said boy I don't like this or whatever I think well really\nYou probably didn't go to an audiologist you know what I'm saying right because it's not done right\nAnd then Dr figure out a ... a lotta times how many people have to come in and they got to try to fix\nWhat the cards that have been built by someone else\nRight absolutely well I I think about my father right he's you know he's older um he's in his eighties and he was very stubborn about getting hearing held isn't\nThat why why it can you explain that to me and I bet you I'll be the same way but explained to me why people are that way I Do they not know they have it\nI think the biggest reason is 'cause you could get by you know you you have hearing loss it may happen gradually you start to read to let you\nStart to turn up or the radio or TV and you start telling the people around you to repeat themselves into speak louder so you find that doctors measures to deny that you actually had that that hearing loss\nOr in my father's case it was because he's an old time are stubborn Italian who just didn't want to admit that you know he needed that kind of help\nAnd we probably took about three to four years to finally convinced him to do something about it\nHow did you know he had the problem was blasting the TV\nFor me the biggest thing was I notice he's very socially I'm engaged very outgoing if we're at parties he's always saying something smart alec\nBut I started to notice that he became more withdrawn I'm honestly we we are actually at times even thought about maybe onset of early dementia because he was becoming very forgetful saying wide or you know maybe not understanding what we were saying\nAnd then once we put the the hearing aids or to get him help or he lit up like a Christmas tree started again to participate\nOn my nephews and nieces asked for a remote control is can we turn these hearing aids down because he's actually hearing too much now but it's back to his old self yeah he really is so it was at my personal story that has nothing to do the Centers for hearing care no but I mean an hour of getting health\nRights but it but it's interesting because of your background but he was I don't say a typical a typical person it says and and you probably explain it better than anyone while I'm getting by if it was his eyesight he would have went to the eye doctor right away I Can't see right ... and ... and I don't understand is people\nThere's there's these misconceptions I always say would you agree it's it's usually somebody around somebody with hearing loss\nThat finally gets them to get the attention on hearing loss would you agree with that\nYes and in this case we got I'm hearing aids and what he would do was win Cheryl came around on the weekends he would put the hearing aids on and then the rest of the time they were sitting in the door until finally you know we said you need to wear these\nAll the time and get the help that you need from these and it's it's changed everyone's lives around them\nRight and ... and we don't have\n... ... with audiologist doing it with coming up with the ... program in the right hearing aids\nAnd how small they are they're not that obvious or anything like that they make it easier for you to hear ... I think one of the most impressive things with the with hearing aids today that of all a game changer so I and I liked the fitbit type things that you were talking about\nBut it is that you don't have a amplifier on your ear so that you're still kinda blasted the TV I think the thing that will keep relationships together is\nThat today's hearing aids I can have my volume on my TV at seven let's say a normal volume for somebody with good hearing sitting in a room\nBut that sound coming out of the TV there's a device that it's connected to your TV is going directly to your hearing aid not through the air but it's like a set of headphones so you're hearing it no matter what the volume is on the TV that I think is a game changer\nRight and and on top of that you can actually prioritize your environment so let's say well you can set these up where if you get within a certain distance from the television they automatically start to stream inside your ear mhm so you're ten feet away from your TV you walk into your living room and the television starts screaming into your ear\nThey can also be programs where you can prioritize whether or not let's say you have a neighbor there talking to you or your wife\nAnd you say I Want to make TV primary I Want that to be drowned out I Want voice around me to be drowned and focus only on television\nOr you can do the opposite where you say if someone's talking to me I Want the television that drowned out a little bit and I want that voice to be brought forward which is amazing technology think of that technology in such a small footprint of a device\nBut its program specifically for you by people who know what they're doing it all starts with that initial visit is what I'm saying that's why the Centers for here in care audiologist test drive program because I could say to you here's this pair which\nDoes this but the next model up does is you see what I'm saying you can actually test drive him as Dr phil ... says so that you can say hey I Do like be better than a right right I mean\nYes and it starts with the discovery you know when you first go in beyond the hearing test you know understanding what your lifestyle is and based on that lifestyle what level of technology you may need\nUm if you're very sedentary and don't get out much you know you may not need a high powered hearing a lot of money you change your like your dad right yeah that's true you might become active right\n... you might become more engaging what I also think that uh that I think people need to know that I've learned here is\nI don't think enough people understand but if you are a diabetic you need a yearly hearing test we always think diabetes diabetes affect your entire body including your hearing I you know and that's something that she has put out there which I think it's vital information\nIf you if you take away if you're on if you got cancer you have to get any type of chemotherapy you need it before you do that to the to get a base I'm hearing test so\nEmail therapy can affect your hearing if you're a diabetic you need a yearly hearing test it can affect your hearing just as a guideline of where you are and where it could be and we can prevent permanent hearing loss on some medication as a result of it\nAfter my break in a second but that ah have a hearing problem and they might be on Social Security and get five hundred\nA month [noise] hang out of sight and we'll come back with more fortune ...\nBack after this\nIran for show on news radio five Seventy W.
