the guy that's done something about it totally and including his party incidentally has done nothing about it\nWhen they weren't power incidentally they've done nothing about it\n\nSo I mean he said

done something about it renegotiated NAFTA it's not even called NAFTA anymore for Canada and Mexico making it making it a horrible deal wasn't fair to the United states fair to the United states\n\nI just want you to think about that for a second just before I go any further here today I just really want you to think about that [noise] you know in the same thing can be said for Tim Ryan Tim Ryan

complaining about it so that Leon agreement that he said during his campaign is it was so lopsided in so anti American and we've seen that over the years and they didn't support him they didn't vote for them they do everything to get in his way or to derail him\nAnd he's the only one that took on the thing that they've been complaining most about doesn't\nThat seem bizarre I mean you'd want to talk about crazy town is that not crazy so that's where I say people are putting party in front of\nBeing an American\nThat's what I like about Trump\nI've told you guys a hundred times I voted for Trump because I agree with him on the issues say a same issues I agreed with Ross Perot on\nI just like what he said about what was wrong in the country and how we're getting the raw end of these deals and how he was going to do something about it and he's doing that and can I tell you what Trump open my eyes to\nThe media bias like I've never seen before did you see sixty minutes last night Leslie stall trying to do what what was the point of that let's try to take him on trying to make money I mean he he handled her but I mean it was just sitting there with\nYou know you're if you're

to do that you use your head\n\nHe's trying to get something done he's trying to reach a deal you know sometimes they get so frustrated because they just like the media is so biased Trump is open my eyes up to how by is the media is\nIt how ridiculous and stupid many of these questions are like you're going to sit there in this world in environment and talk bad about this person or that person when he got to deal with them and try to reach agreements with them\n\nI found that somewhat refreshing I just said I enjoyed the interview with Leslie staunch Trump last night I really did\n\nSit there and that's my president I'm Glad he is\n\nNot as an American I look at that hypocrisy\nIn it and it absolutely be Wilders me\nAnd those of you to listen for I've been here a long time know that

guys\nI thought this was interesting individual income taxes or the federal government's single biggest revenue source in fiscal year twenty eight team which ended September thirtieth the individual income tax is expected to bring in roughly one point seven trillion thanks talk one point seven trillion\nOr about half of all federal revenue in past statistics can offer any guidance in two thousand sixteen at one point four trillion income taxes were paid by one hundred and forty point nine million taxpayers reporting a total of ten point two trillion in adjusted gross income\nBloomberg looked into the two thousand sixteen individual returned data in detail for some additional insights listen to this the top one percent paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven point three percent than a bottom Ninety percent combined\nSo you know when you when you hear like guys like Tim Ryan acting like the rich people aren't paying their fair share it's statistically bull crap the top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax\nThinking what I'm saying just so when you hear the bull crap that you hear from Tim Ryan and the Democrats the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income taxes which means the bottom fifty per cent paid three percent\nWhat's the problem with this picture what group are you when you're willing to say take more of my money government the top one\nPercent paid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven point three percent than the bottom Ninety percent combines\n\nSo this idea that oh if you're wealthy you're not paying anything in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent which small percent of taxpayers also paid three percent or more you might have guessed it\nMade me think about this\nI mean it's it's crazy when you look at this\n\nIs the absolute insanity news radio five Seventy ... hello mayor ... hill

divide by eighty eight counties now I don't want to hear you're not with the party in charge I don't want to hear excuses you've done ... nothing during your entire tenure there you didn't form a coalition you didn't work across the aisle with Republicans you didn't get anything done to solve this problem\nThat is raising taxes in every local politicians complain about you've done none of that so don't make excuses don't blame the governor don't blame the other party what\nHave you done to to to overcome all of that and if the answer is nothing then\nThe problem all this other stuff all of this other stuff is just be yes it's all just be those are the two biggest problems coming from the state the county engineer will tell you stop digging up the gas tax by\nCounties do it by road miles and all these local officials will complain about the rainy day fund and not getting our local government money back\nStop ... and yet\nThey'll still vote for the same state reps who have done nothing

only have a moment to have my heart attack first no God no but you do you understand what I'm saying this is\nYou know there are ... like I say there are ones that you got to consider and vote for you know if you got to you if you got an area that's run well and you know like I say if you're a police department as one policemen are one of the police but I Would definitely vote for that levee because you want to keep that but on the other hand\nYou gotta you gotta say to yourself\nDo what do we need issue to do we really need to say hey take more of my money for this are you kidding me\nAren't you taking it up and you don't want to sick of Gino I Am serious about this\nForget all the money I'm paying that's taken for granted and forget about it it's the money I'm not willing to pay how dare you want to keep your money in style is from taking I forget all you're paying more ... you don't want to give us not give us we were pissed you won't let us take more back to her and\nHer eye in the community because you don't want to pay your taxes on what the hell\nDo I pay my taxes and I pay 'em on time well you you you could have so you you see what I'm saying but you know I'm not sitting as a trustee in my own township were two of them basically are on the public payroll with public benefits public retirements not in a private sector\nTotally honest better retirement better benefits better everything telling me I got to pay more you see what I'm saying and the third one who ... who admitted in the paper he didn't pay us federal tax it must have a hard time paying that\nThat that make it damned bit of sense to me that that makes it that's lunacy committee apps lunacy you don't want I Want them all to do go in business in the private sector start writing checks to the government all the time 'cause that's what you're going to do\nWell that's like Tim Ryan saying that that the tax cuts all for the rich and only for the match bull crap hey\nLet me tell you our company Ron he ran back to them on any equipment to show extra paid holidays sheer wages have to go up because now after probably ten years of stagnation people are are are vying for our employees and were vying for there's what attracts\nAll you don't tell me teach right we don't know what that one just\nGoing to an Arnold he'll get set but what did what you know Tim Ryan ... attitude is let's punish the productive and successful by taking more of their money is it that the exact that they're already paying a book a taxes I just read from blurring Bloomberg they're paying off the top fifty percent piece Ninety seven percent of the taxes\nSo you know the bottom fifty percent are paying now and why do you have an eye on it take\nYou want to take their ability to make jobs ... jobs away\nYou know why don't you try and say hey drops of like what is Tim Ryan act like they're not paying enough because they're paying the bulk of it right now why does yeah well you got it right I mean so he's caught so screw you\nYou know I look I say that so many times I look at them kids that I went to college with it became doctors they gave up their twenties you know what I ... I gave up for years to get a bachelor's degree they kept on going and they gave up their ten years of their life and they got out and they make good money damage they earned it\nThey they you know they deserve it should we punish them by saying let's tax you more that's crazy\nYeah that's absolutely craziness I've watched guys who invested all of their savings re mortgage your house to start a business and lost it all because something happened in their business lost everything and I've\nAlso got a ... I work for success right and that's exactly what he is right and I also want he I was in a hundred people who are ... and are successful and when they're successful\nThey they they deserve it the business owns them that's America and these guys want to punish that\nI Believe all Comey Gino you thanks for one\nOh [laughter] I still do your parents don't [laughter] no [laughter] no he's got to

writing can do it in one sitting right\nRight I Know I always amazes me how many years I've done it ... it was always telling me things that you know you come in and you can leave literally at ten

fifty\nFour right now sunshine too you know matter what the weather news radio find somebody to carry on Karl on a cell run although here hello\nRon how're you doing a swell Carl's well you're doing okay now okay you're getting a little ah yeah little work though that the guy got a good thought for you though I can use it\nI was I was listening to your interview with the ... still\nYes imagine if we found a congressman\nThat could work or would work is hard in a smart for his constituency is on a does in large town\nOr anything or yeah or knew how to play the game new to say is an American I agree with what the president's doing so I'm going to support that instead of being a negative all the time to the president and in turn we suffer as a result of his political ...\nDoing in an address to the guy when you think about it he complained about NAFTA he's an adversary that guy\nAnd and he and he does something about it can you do some cheerleading to help it and maybe this area benefit as a result of it it's not about Tim Ryan it's not about his next political move it's not about him getting reelected it's about what can you do to better benefit to Syria and I think he's got a mediocre performance the vindicate or endorsed him today\nBut I either endorsing a mediocre performance I Believe you should have a better\nResults than you're seen do you\nSo yeah well look the way that I look at it is his support of the Democratic talking points is his reveal of what his purpose is\nHis purpose was not I don't understand is purposes not hunting valley it's not Trumbull county the area his constituency is going around I Do not understand if that indoors but within Sunday's paper was there if they can do except\nOn either I was a ... or maybe it was Sundays I\nBut I think it was a combination with him and Johnson they said we need to have\nMy but can I tell you why why would I vote for Bill Johnson because he supports the president why do I know why would I vote for somebody who supports the president because I think we're on the right track you get it I mean when I look economically terrorism when I see where things are going I like it Carl\nI'm not kidding you when I say about their endorsement I find it refreshing and their endorsement\nAnd honest to God it means nothing to me because they endorse every tax they and don't you know I I don't care one way endorse any more I think there is lost as a day is long too I think we've had her mediocre representation around here and and the and it's time to move on go ahead\nWell my point was is it a big part of their endorsement was based on tenure yeah and the quote was we can't afford to lose so rarely okay so cheap that mediocrity earlier sixteen years of tenure as given us what\nAll this money their base it's given your mediocrity I Believe you can ... only right you're absolutely right\nSo why not so let's keep 'em there for a lifetime and and get mediocre results based on what they said here's what based on the indicator then I don't think anyone should run against anybody we should always just thought the incumbent be reelected ... that's the philosophy then\nExactly exactly and what's gonna happen what's gonna happen if his ... national\nUm\nWhat is national goals or achieved in that he does decide to run for speaker of the house or he does decide to run for president\nHe'll be counting the party line and and you and it doesn't matter what\nSee that happening with the Democrats are just going to they're they're just going to screw everything up when it's going in the right direction so we can get back to mediocrity in politics as usual and that sickened me because what you're seeing go on right now in my opinion is honest to God political courage taken on lobbyists\nTaken on these contracts had been put America First while you're witnessing is something that I personally find refreshing as an American\nI I agree with you a hundred percent\nI mean I just I find that refreshing in it and you know what I learned from this call I learned the media bias\nThat that they have against Trump\nAnd even the instilled bias against him within the government and that that really bothers me because you know what is it that really is non at me I mean it's just not at me the media biased is sickening if it wasn't really for Fox News there wouldn't be anything\nBut I mean you got all this other entities against him he got Fox News and that's about it and they're always mentioned about Fox News that's the only one\nWell the media bias has always been against the conservative element current in fact that's what we're responsible for the creation of Fox News right\nAnd and so now you put a unconventional president combined with the conservative policies and you know it even becomes much much worse but\nUm although although I Will say that even among some of the conservative policies Trump's not allowed to speak his mind if we think something's not going in the right direction\nWhat's wrong what's wrong with speaking your mind and telling the truth nothing\nI mean whatever you know what I don't care anymore like I said ... instead of bichon about the money that I'm not willing to pay what about appreciating all the money I'm already paying in taxes now I just tell people when it comes to property tax when you're paying as much as I Am come and talk to me about why do I need to pay more until then\nI don't want to hear it you know what I'm saying\nAnd I I live in a joke coke home you know I'm not I'm not in a castle or anything like that but I think four thousand plus dollars a year is enough Carl I really do but\nI think that an off and it's adding and if all this crap passes now we're going to be for it closer to four and a half and then we'll get to five and you know with no end in sight\nBut no end in sight because and we have all these democratic politicians around here who think I should be taxed and the rest of you who work and pay for everybody makes a stupid decision if somebody makes a stupid decision they're not accountable we should raise your taxes to pay for that\nReally seriously I'm not paying enough I got to take care of everybody we need to take care of ... somebody\nWe need somebody who can take a bully pulpit locally in stand up and identify the problem there heart problems and identify the hearts solution who's not afraid to speak up\nHow 'bout how 'bout layman with thing in the right direction if nothing's gonna\nAbout living within a budget government's going to have to live within a budget and we're going to have to prioritize within a budget you know ... and all these people to tell me that that's the case you know can you imagine these are part time jobs a state rep some part time job at sixty thousand dollars and gold plated benefits in retirement it's a part time job\nRight thinking about that but you know this ... you know like when I see signs like I saw that well you know these judgeship signs that kind of stuff when I read the paper that you're ... and his father nice guy sitting together in a room saying one hand washes the other and I'm thinking and this guy wants to be a\nJudge I I don't get it I I don't know what you know you know and maybe it makes me stopping wonder and I always say does anybody read this stuff or is it just me I'm On another planet\nYou know but I don't I I really don't care I think some of these people think they're entitled to these jobs are entitled to this pay they're entitled to these benefits Carl telling me I'm wrong\n... police have released the names of the victims in bumped in that deadly stabbing forty\nOne year old Michael ...

they brought to small hip to town you know and it's the big savior I knew that he wouldn't do any better than out I've been around long enough altitude Palo Wendy Web and all the rest of them I've been through all these people\nThat we're all going to save the schools and I realize the superintendent had nothing to do a saving the schools and I would always arguing to your parents that are dedicated to education and see their kids go to bed on time do their homework\nStudy and all this kind of stuff set a good example until you do that I don't care who the superintendent is\nSo basically he said mediocre results collected a bunch of money throws in the towel in and leaving town I don't care who they bring in until you change that dynamic nothing at the school system is going to change because that's the truth is is the fault of parents students\nAnd uh and so\nIt doesn't matter well I I also think the same thing can be said for what's happening locally with a representation I think we've had mediocre representation that people have become accustomed to and I think you should change it and try\nTo see if it can be better to imagine Sherrod Brown Rick ... richest men in politics since he left college he's now sixty five years old\nThinking that it was perfect the professional political class if you think about it the last three presidents\nPrior to Trump Obama never held a drop of his wife George Bush was born with the silver spoons serve soup out of a silver bowl by the butler\nAnd ... who came straight out of college and went straight into into politics none of those three numbers three men\nEver held a real job in the white properly used as worked for a living and produce things and and one company I mean and I think it's refreshing to have a real person and that offers gr change rather than these you know make believe politicians that have never worked for what\nDid you happen to see 'em on sixty minutes I thought he handled Leslie stall well\nOh I loved it I absolutely loved it because you know you always have a president on there and there are so deferential to the reporter and they don't want to insult the reporter\nAnd he just doesn't care running he just says it the way it is and it's actually just refreshing\nRight I mean ... and boy did she have a bias against him or what\nOh she can't stand them right I mean she fled I Can't stand them\nThe one other thing I wanted to say though where you were talking about the ah the slush from the Ohio a little higher has three billion dollars that they have set aside rainy day fund\nAnd if you remember when Strickland was done this but the state was basically bankrupt there was no money correct and so they cut the local government funding took that money and put it in there so that if you know eventually it's going to go bad again it just does the economy cycles\nSo there's a nice cushion in there now to be used when the economy goes down\nI think it is fundamentally wrong for all these politicians to want to get their hands in there and start grabbing that money and spending it because number one most are the ones that want to spend with the Democrats around here didn't do anything to try and save it and number two if you spend it what are you going to do in the next economic downturn cops\nWell even the even the same folks argue you got to have a cushion locally to go one year to the next well the state has to have one now one can debate how big that cushion needs to be\nI I I don't think having three billion dollar sitting around you know if it's invested I Would have no problem with them\nTake movie interest or earnings that it makes being invested in using that to you know divvied up among the ... the the local government forms and what have you but just start dipping into the principal and you know it's it would be like a farmer starting to you know the seed corn that he needs next to your point across\nAnd I just think that's ... that's a terrible terrible proposition anybody that is advocating that should be called out for the irresponsible for school behavior they're exhibiting or or you're advocating for I think is a terrible idea\nWhat kind of like the commercials they run against Michael Rowley which are just off which are ridiculous I mean the commercials are ready to do anything that we were all joke yeah nothing to do with\nBeing be afraid all listen his whole ie cut school thing which is their talking points is also ridiculous and over most people said it's a ... I mean I'm\nA ... in about an hour I'm going to get to go to fantasy land that are in a cave herself for school board\nMeeting for the month and they're going to do the five year forecasts\nAre all here about how terrible it is but you know we lose all this money to charter schools and open a woman kids go elsewhere but it's OK roping around when it comes out of the problem with public officials are they never have enough of your and my money it's never enough\nThe county through an immense a grand total of bridges eight million dollars recovered bridge\nMhm\n[laughter] that's why one chapter

because of tariffs raising prices as well and some people say it's because of a brisk economy and some people say maybe it's all of those things I'm going to try to get to the bottom of all of

our President Trump is now meeting with farmers in Georgia whose crops are affected by the destruction caused by hurricane Michael as he continues a tour of the rabbit Syria\nThe exact opposite he has a temper great months August scream excuse me August great man that's a ... month now in the beginning of October a little iffy and then obviously\nPretty hard downturn here on the NASDAQ and the down the S. and P. this last past week but it was to be expected if this market will continue to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow without releasing a little bit of era to bloom\nYou create a huge bubble and then it would blow up like an eighty seven market crash\nSo what happened is that what has to happen for the swing sharper come into effect does this thing has to pull back and then create what's called a ... cat poop so pools back pulled back ... back to sort of ... and then when it launches that goes even further than what it was back in August ... September which where the highs\nSo that's what I Believe that data doesn't support anything catastrophic\nLike people are thinking that's going to happen it's all media related I have the same exact conversations with folks and on the show and so February and I call it like a like a start yeah this is what's going to happen is what I Believe\nAnd and sure enough it did and then I'm not saying again that I'm guaranteeing it's got to be right but it sure looks identical to what we had in February\nSo so so\nI get it through my head why are some market going down and so it's it is\nEverything in a market based on greed and fear every single based on greed and fear and and when you commit so what happened as the media got a hold of interest rate increases Trump kind of I don't know stepped on his own for a little bit by blaming the fed for going crazy which in which even added more gasoline to the fire\nAnd then kind of obviously cemented in their their their stance and and something I Wish he went to Don and just basically media media flashing the risk lights\nMedia flashing the fear gauge as oh hell is going to break all health related then it becomes it's just so its own self fulfilling prophecy\nAnd then it goes down and everybody and then somebody across street just oh man it's going down and the other guy so we have gone down in better so off and you have an over inflated sell off for a reason well nothing fundamentally behind\nAnd and that's what happened here so basically a ... to ... for your on your question is a good one this because you want a heart heart fact of what's causing it the answer is there's no hard facts there's there's there's just just only fear driving that market down which I think it's temporary\nAnd like when I was down six hundred points the the you know looking back what last week and I'm just like in eighty nine ... down like eighty\nThree by the end of the day on the go\nInto your investors calling you or are they concerned and yeah yeah I'm Sorry I cut you off guard no I uh obviously a lot of 'em don't because they figure you got it under control so what are you what is your strategy are you buying into the market more I mean what are you doing right now\nWell new investors money we are I I'm waiting a little bit I think we have about a week week and a half\nTo maybe even ten you know ten trading days before the stink stabilizes so we're waiting on new money majority of my money's been invested\nNow ...
