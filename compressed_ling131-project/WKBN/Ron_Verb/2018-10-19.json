inspections that were necessary\nCame to a brand new country and like all people that were here were exploited when they got here\nBut they came here because they wanted freedom they came here because

become successful\n\nHave a Democratic Party that wants to take take away the Trump tax cuts which benefited more than just business incidentally\nYeah benefited small business individuals benefit it's so much so many that proposal would get rid of the tax cuts so right off the bat what's the what's\nDemocrats want to do they want to raise the taxes on people again now the tax cuts simply made it when it came to taxes in corporations go from a ridiculous\nAmounts to a more competitive amounts it didn't eliminate him that's what it\nDid and as a result of that and cutting regulation economy is booming and as a result of that people can get jobs for better jobs or graduate high school and college and get a job\nThere is a labor shortage so wages go up as a result of that everything is good for every one who can work if you can pass a drug test if you can show up if you have a work ethic\nI Want you to think about that\nWith things as strong as they are your kid gets out of high school they can get a decent job\nOut of college you can get a job you stuck in a job you don't like you could find another one want to make more money you can find another one that's what you get when you have a labor shortage like we have like Greenspan talked about that I mentioned yesterday a tight labor market\n\nAnd that comes as a result of what that comes to some result of a booming economy booming economy came as a result of tax cuts and cutting regulation and other things that Trump did but that's why it's here\nAnd you have Democrats\nDon't want to get rid of the tax cuts and and things like you know you can appreciate something in one year okay for a business let's say a business goes out and buys a new pickup truck instead of writing it off over time they conducted all

about\nThere was a time living or not in this area where Campbell at the highest percentage of millionaires you wouldn't never known and it was because\nThat was said immigrated to this country over there in the camel worked very very hard and educated their children and since when don't we teach that's confess only comes with hard work\nIf you don't have an experience that hard work you're never going to reach that ... that should be important Ron should be very important you know it it's scary any I don't know if he caught I was watching today's morning Tom Brokaw was on\nAnd tomorrow is the

together on both sides when that was going on\nMaggie pause for a second I don't think that's doable anymore and I'm going to tell you why when I hear people say well why can't we agree and I'm gonna tell you why we can agree no the philosophies are so dramatically different\n... the ... the Democrats of today are not like the Democrats of the past the philosophies are so dramatically different you had you know your philosophy a conservative philosophy of smaller government lower taxes is nice\nThe philosophy of the Democratic party which stands for bigger government more taxes and socialism those two parties cannot agree on anything he has a philosophy or ...\nYears ago the Democratic party was for protecting the working man now they're for handing it all the way\nI mean you know right when you you know the ...\nThe male thing that was to protect the worker to make sure they're safe for working and fair wages\nThat's that's what the Democratic party was sunny\nAnd ... and may I add and I don't know the name but I don't know if you've got to where they came out what they need it lifting a via the numbers for the the economy that are doing best in the world\nI hate to say it but the U.S was the number one for the first time out of a hundred and thirty some countries in a long time\nCorrect but I I Want you to think about that when when I'm reading this article where we're it's we're in a sense it's says Democrats want to repeal Trump's tax cuts and replace them with payouts\nSo there's so few semi socialism to say we didn't eliminate taxes we lowered 'em down then people are benefiting from it not just business but businesses and evil that two employees people we just made the corporate tax rate competitive so the the corporate tax rate is now people who people are saving money\nIn wait a minute individuals and the economy is prospering Maggie think about the economy is booming so I'm dead serious when I see this whether it offends you I Can't help it but I'm dead serious when I say you've got to be a complete deadbeat\nNot to be able to find a job in this economy and I mean it which means the following there's some people are unemployable because of themselves for the choice they can't pass a drug test maybe\nThey don't show up to work they don't call off of work they got to some issues that make themselves not the fault of government or anyone else unemployable\nAnybody outside of that category who wants to job can find a job with an economy with a tight labor market and not only if they get a lousy job they can find a better job and people are starting to get pay increases as a result of all of this stuff all of this stuff\nThe Democrats or Republicans men women blacks Hispanics everybody benefits from\nAnd the economic plan of the Democratic party is repeal the tax cuts take that money and give it to people or your monthly payments or give it to them is a is a lump sum you'll get six thousand more year that is socialism is a lot and let me\nThan there is a fair bit coming up but it doesn't mean that dollar\nAnd being that dialect last year and that's right yes that got us in a very sharp enough time\nTo talk I appreciate it I Know this is\nA\nI mean how timely this is that Russia would say that on his sanity interview last night\nOn Fox News and I'd be reading this today\nLimbaugh said basically he's more motivated than he's ever been because he thinks this country the one our country is at a crossroads\n\nBut there's plenty of people that want to take it in the direction of socialism everything should be free free college\nFree health care\n\nNow they want to take your tax these people and give it to these people\nIn going that direction\n\nIt's like buying votes it's like I've told you before honestly forty years ago makes me sound like a modern too\nBut I've been on TALK radio a long time and I remember whether it was in Canton or in Akron at the time I remember specifically\nPeople that were calling me and it said Ron you're going to come a day when the people that are getting well out number the people that are\nTaxed and they will control the system\nThey were warning me of this forty years ago these people he's old guys are dead\nNow\nAnd the weird thing is forty years later I can still hear their comments and my I can still hear him\nAnd they weren't visionary\nThey were warning what's ahead I remember all of that and they were right\nAnd now I look in a in a in ... I read this kind of stuff I mean you got to hear it if you didn't hear it at three with midterm elections two and a half weeks away the twenty twenty presidential race around the corner\nProminent Democrats are embracing ambitious idea repeal and replace one point five trillion Republican tax plan the proposal would get rid of the tax cuts in and turn funnel money into government guaranteed cash for low and middle income households\n\nCamilla Harris senator announced a plan this week that would give working families up to six thousand dollars each year with the option of receiving monthly payments well that is socialism we're going to the tax these people and we're going to give you the money you're not earning it's Kamala Harris a Democrat from California\n\nThe proposal would get rid of the tax cuts in and turn funnel money and the government guaranteed cash for low and middle income households just going to start giving you money\nHarris and that's the plan is weak that would give working families up to six thousand dollars each year with the option receiving monthly payments oh Senator Sherrod brown outlined a similar idea last year another reason why I refused to vote for him\nA bill from representative body Watson a Democrat from New Jersey would allow stay at home parents and students to receive money as well\nThe idea was to provide a clear contrast with Trump you know what you could actually do with this money you could give anyone making under Seventy five thousand dollars a raise they don't say but the person who's paying its you're gone you're taking from them and giving it to someone else who has an earned it\nAnother government's confiscation giveaway program\nTurning as soon as social is so they they want to stop one of the most prosperous economy so that's going\n\nThey want to stop a guy who said he I Want to get four or five percent GDP and Obama and the Democrats made fun of them like he was on cocaine\nI Want to get four or five percent growth and they thought it was crazy\nAnd by cutting regulations and by cutting taxes and by making it more friendly business environment America's back on top again of with terrorists and negotiating these deals there is a labor shortage wages are going up people can find better jobs kids can get jobs out of school and they want to stop all of that\nSo the focus of the Democratic party isn't the best social program is a good job the best their idea is let's stop all of that start taxing these people and give it to these people who are doing nothing\nDo you agree with that this is a crossroads in this country and it is troubling times ahead for the future of this country has taken from this group and given to that group just doesn't work it just makes for a lot of lazy

are released you will be released to await a hearing on your claim of asylum\nThe odds are excellent that you can vanish into the U.S\nPopulation and never be sent back\nSo there you have a pet is what is going on not opinion that is what is going on\nOne and mass migration is the issue of our time is there is no foreseeable and stewards before it alters America\nAs these migrants are almost all poor not highly skilled send do not speak English most will join the segment of our population of pay no income taxes but qualifies for social welfare benefits like food stamps medical care and

these\nMigrants over our present and future benefit to the Democratic party that built and maintains are mammoth welfare state and which in presidential elections routinely when Seventy to Ninety percent of the votes of people whose trace their ancestry to Asia Africa and Latin America\nNot without reason Democrats believe that if they can change the\nComposition of the American electorate they can control America forever if Donald Trump was elected on any one issue it was immigration and as promised to secure the border build a wall\nAnd just all the invasion now he deals with the impending crisis of the migrant caravan may affect boats the fate of his party in November and his presidency and twenty twenty\nBut there's there's one it's all about you know so you know is that's really what it's all about no doubt about it saying let's take him in order to thank you for your call and we'll go to Gary thank you for waiting your next in line go ahead Gary\nFirst of all are agreeing with everything you said today ah you know I had a good discussion two days ago on a drunk yeah and I was wrong about a couple of things\nI I decided to research the prison population us pertains to drug use and all that on the Internet and I found out that first I made the assumption that fifty percent of people who are in the U.S prison population are there for drug related offenses and that's not true it's thirty percent\nHum next I made this option that if you're caught using you may go to jail that's not sure either was found out is that\nCertainly there's two point two million people in prison and thirty percent of that is six hundred sixty thousand they're there for drug related offenses I'm sort of time that is that if you're caught with possession\nOf a maybe a schedule one one of the worst class of drugs I depending on your Pryor's I in depending on whether or not to draw the the the courts wants to state that you had intend to sell\nThat will determine if you're going to go to jail or not so what ended up happening is if you're caught maybe with five or six grams of some illicit schedule on substance they automatically assume you're potentially\nSo his comment was I'd rather have a guy that's maybe a little rough around the edges and really doesn't care what everybody's thinking about it but get something done than somebody that everybody likes like we've had with all previous presidents as he pointed out Republican Democrat Democrat and I've got nothing done\nAnd they can to and they didn't pay their obligations\nNo ... and look at it and I'll say this to you I think Reagan was probably the greatest president and I I I bought a lot of outrage and I lived through I was in the military when he was president\nAh you know the end of the Cold War so I I give him a lot of perks for that and and and I when you say that about Trump a little rough around the edges I'm okay with that I liked it he ruffled feathers I liked that he's I I just think there's a lot of things that he gets way too deep into\nJust kept nothing to do with anything it just leaves Stormy Daniels alone leave the Russia thing alone will want to do your job\nHow much more done have you ever seen an attack every week over some issue to try to derail Trump I've never seen anything like it ever seriously ever Stormy Daniels Russian probe in and they never produce anything other than what can we do next to Ron\nRon once he cut it out every day and age just hope for is more gas on the fire I think that most people if you look back at the polls two to three months ago most people are kind of like Russia whatever\nUh you know blah blah blah but then he just keeps coming out and Everytime he stoke the fire it rekindled people's interest so look I I'm not gonna I'm I'm I'm I I'm just simply saying that I think there are certain things that I agree\nWith you the president should be the president and All right I like the back but I got a break thank you

them come in and just dumped their medication what we want them to do is come in get the weight off ... all the medical insurance as high blood pressure type two diabetes right now the high road issues I even digested issues as soon as you get the weight on even arthritis\nDissing these marker started to improve I see patients every day on a daily basis are gone back to their primary care physicians and the doctors and guess what you've lost weight your blood pressure normal you no longer need the medication\nYou're a one sees level of ... meaning you no longer a diabetic and we see that literally on a day to day basis and we know as soon as we can get the weight I guess what not only is medication tend to go away but your level of health improves\nDo you get a lot of people Dr factors that have been on other diets and they do you know they lose the weight gain it back there almost defeated them discouraged when they\nCome in well you know run I see that every single day and most people that come to see me I always say this isn't the first rodeo I mean people get to a point where they get desperate and a lot of times people send me doc I fall into two categories either I can lose weight and I've done it before it's hard but I always gain it back or\nI'm In that situation that I Can't get weight off anymore so no matter what rich a plateau lily every shot plateau where they get older this hormone components to it which will talk about a little bit toxicity can bonus\nBut regardless of which one of those individuals are we know this is your desire is there to lose weight you're willing to make a couple of simple changes and fall of set protocol that's literally pine tested as also offers an unconditional guarantee we know we can help you get to where you need to go\nWhy is your program so different than other weight loss programs\nWatch a great question Neal so let me start from the beginning first and foremost Ron most weight loss programs that are very very slow you look at the average died either it lasts about Seventy two hours and the reason the average diet last three days I always say every somebody's undo died every single Monday is what happens you don't see success you know human nature we're proven that if we don't see a wake up\nAnd I guess what happens we want to quit\nThe other issue as it becomes willpower over science what that means is that we get very very hungry okay I'm going to psych myself up today and I can eat any of the carbohydrates and we need all healthy foods and the problem is the blame your smile but the blood sugar levels drop okay we've been there were a lot of ... that cravings are intense out there in the hunger is there so what happens\nWhen you address these components and that's really what we do we ... the you know a jail gets you literally in a narrow fat burning zone we get you to the point right now are well you're not hungry all the time by using a very heavy but not stimulate appetite suppressant we looked the hormone levels\nWe look at the toxicity and you combine this together with the right nutrition at the right time of day the end result on his way comes off in our average patient I was just telling you offer before we started\nYou know one of your eye heart counterparts in Pittsburgh you know comes into my office Nineteen thousand Twenty one days in the morning wholesome one of the shelves he's never seen anything like this before\nAnd I said the fall of the protocol you're going to see great success and and that's not average and he's done exceptionally well\nOur typical patient our average patient Ron\nHalf upon per day coming off every six weeks cycles\nIs the program cater to each individual patient specifically when they come in and you see what what how much weight they want to lose or what they need to lose the cater to that certainly is\nAgainst Ron everybody's in a different situation is somebody coming in at only needs lose ten or Fifteen pounds is not any medications is certainly can be treated differently than somebody that comes in to say I need to lose Seventy five or a hundred pounds\nI'm contemplating surgery I'm contemplating you know maybe a lap band or something different type two diabetic I'm like insulin wherever it may be obsolete we're able to customize that approach and that is so so important and make unique for that individual\nPeople are so discouraged show Dr factor because it's the same thing it's like you know you got to eat a salad or you've got to eat stuff that you just started crazy about and you've got an exercise like crazy and you can do that so long but you're hungry all the time that's why people gain it back when you work with your clients do they lose weight do they keep it off what do they say to you\nWell let me explain the most important part of this whole program it's not just losing weight there's a lot of ways to lose weight without health rarely Lloyd's getting healthy but most importantly is getting a lifestyle tools and here's what I tell every individual that comes in if you fall or protocol and you go back and do everything you've done before and don't do anything you're going to gain weight back whether it be our program or any other program\nBut will we pride ourselves in as not having people taking the customize supplementation the rest of their life\nShown in the lifestyle pools where they can say hey you know what I'm able to do this for example I just had a lady I Want her local TV stations the other day lost over a hundred pounds on my program she was going on and on with the host about diabetes blood pressure's you self esteem and me mental issues physical issues and just going on and on and the ... knock and what are you so proud of\nI said I'm most proud not that she lost the weight and she kept it off now for almost two years and what we do is we teach people as tools to be able to stay within about five to ten pound range and people enjoy that so they're they're able to go out once or twice a week and have the foods they like it's life changing for folks absolutely that life changing\nTell me about some of the patients and what the un what they've done give me some examples a doctor factor\nWell let me read let me tell you a quick story by Melanie I'm gonna read is the right now you know Melanie\nCame in she says you know I heard you want to your local radio stations and she says\nHere's the situation she said I was always able to lose weight in the past before she said but once I had to buy forty years old it became very very challenging is that answers your hormones change jobs there is a hormone level to others toxicity levels to it absolutely does\nAnd she says I got to the point that nothing was work and she says I was going to the big box programs going in the meetings each week and she was I was averaging about a pound every two weeks and it's frustrating\nShe said I met somebody that does your program she said I was skeptical like most people I heard this you know what I told her I said I really believe that I'm going to get you down about twenty pounds of weight\nAnd about four to six weeks she said man those numbers seem really high solace maybe you follow are able to do it it's going to happen and she did the program is designed you know is able to take off over twenty pounds of weight in less than six weeks and this is what you said to me this is the first time that I've had hope\nThis is the first time if somebody gave me a system and I hear this time and time again she said after two to three days the hunger started to decrease the craving started to go to die\nWhen my blood sugar levels were normalized because of supplementation we use\nAnd I saw success I could go forward and that's really the big key and she says I have a new fond hope right now and and that's the key given people that knew fond hope Ron so they know they can get where they need to go\nAll right specifically designed for each individual person I just want people to understand that for how much weight they need to lose or they want to lose and it's and it's not something that is going to be just a frustrating like so many diets now talk a little bit ... about ...\nYou're going to give our audience a special offer and I want you to talk about it's here today because it's something you don't normally do but what are you going to do for us well let me explain though you know at a ...\nA lot of weight loss can be frustrating and I said this before you know I have people from young Sinai people from ... Ohio I can fill the Columbia enemies are that these are tons of come to the top of my head that have driven up to see it but\nYou find it rewarding because as you were telling me prior to going on here it's real warning because not only do people get to get healthier\nAt the bottom line is they feel better about themselves I mean it is life changing you know we always hear about the plastic surgeon you're pretty you're pretty proud of what you\n... thank you and I always say this you know we're doin' plastic surgery to the inside you know the physical and emotional component to it\nAnd the thing is to around when you lose weight I'm telling you everything starts to change the thing is and you mentioned this early and I wore I absolutely want to touch on his people get frustrated and their belief system for a lot of people they just give up they say you know what nothing's going to work for me and there's a reason why we have people driving to see us\nYou know if you know forty five minutes to an hour to an hour and a half more on radio stations all over\nAnd we have people to drive into the nice thing about our office so even though we're located in ...\nYou know I took me about forty five minutes to get here today you know depending upon where you're at east or west of the city maybe it's an hour but the nice thing about our program is we only have to see them on for the first visit\nOkay we if we come up we do a consultation with them when you were a view of the system it takes us about an hour in the in the individual to size it you know what I Want to do it involved a ... year old ... because we all hate Dr ... no drugs are no surgery our job is to lift people up you know meet them where they're out of an amazing team that just\nAs passionate to help but here's a sharp NATO sharp needles but here's the reason I mentioned is so so the reason is is that some of the individual comes and we're going to give him an opportunity to preview our system it absolutely no cost to see what this is the ... people have questions will this work from your house is so different I tell people is uh twenty first century approach\nYou know one promise that I have for every individual's once they understand that they've never seen this before you know their typical medical doctor is not going to put them on a program they're not going to order the stuff on line\nSo the reason I say that is it the individual comes and they decide they want to start the program they only have to come see us one time we do everything on that first visit and then after that or coaching has done remotely either via phone or email\nNow obviously there's a situation that we need to bring somebody back and we do that so here's our offer works with very exclusive opera for news radio five Seventy WKBD and if you're one of the first twenty callers that called in Arbor I'm going to give that\nYou're going to be eligible for free no obligation office review\nRon and what that means is that we're not allow the individual to come in and find out what this is about answer their questions when I Do a health history\nWhere and see what medications are all going to find out of able to lose weight\nOr they were already at the point in their lifetime not losing weight so you're going to check my background or to come in Oregon and when I entered your background check your health history or ... you know absolutely we're also going to do a complete body composition analysis and this is important when the fat percentage and the body the body mass index these are all important numbers\nAnd then at that point if we truly feel we can help the individual we're going to tell them that and our goal for everybody rye is if we can help them is to help them take the most amount of weight off in the shortest amount of time in a very safe manner\nAnd most importantly teach 'em a lifestyle pools to keep it off\nSo again if you're one of the first ... hours not only are we going to give you the no cost obligation consultation or going to put a fifty dollar gift card aside good towards any of our guarantee programs and the radio could use on that is going to be WKBD in fifty again there is no obligation riding on top of that\nI tell people this all the time you know depending upon where you're writing on listening you're it's about a forty five minutes to an hour drive one promise and a half of your listeners is that I Will not waste their time this could be the most important visit they've ever had before we're going to allow them to preview the system going into a body composition announced it's going to find out where the rat look at a press medical history there\nYou know how much weight they've been able to lose what their goal waited and want to do that body composition analysis\nAnd we truly feel we can help them we're going to tell them that\nSo I'm going to give a number I had that number to call right now it's eight five five eight to eight then at eight five five eight to eight eight for for six and the keypad\nAnd if they use a promo code W. K. being fifty Ron we're going to put a fifty dollar gift card aside\nYou know good towards any of our guarantee programs and just as a gift for the first twenty individuals for coming to see me we're going to give them one of our proprietary metabolic weight loss products which is valued at fifty dollars and that's just a gift whether we're able to help them or they do the program or not they can take 'em\nAnd so so if you call that number and they they come and see you you design a program for that person give me that guarantee again\nThe only way I only find guarantee works it's as simple as we accept the patient on our program and they don't take a minimum twenty pounds all laid off in the first six weeks or less Ron we're going to change and where and modify the program and we do it at our expense\nAnd the reason we do that as we realized people have been bar before people are skeptical to say you know what will this work for me if I invest some time and resources am I going to get my success and I tell everybody has to be follow the program it's going to work in ... and they well\nRight and he's got a track record to prove that don't ya we do thank you very or go give the number one more time in folks take advantage of it in to see what he can do for you good healthy stay healthy take weight off feel better about yourself it's a phone call away\nAnd to you got to go see Dr factor what's\nThe number I get I get paid five five eight to eight dinner at eight five five aid to aid for for six and a key pad run and they can always find out more at the Iraq that common that promote Cody use right now is WKBD in fifty and again for the first ... hours we're going to get one of ... just for coming in business\nIs a free gift of your listeners you know what I like to say you have nothing to lose but a lot of weight absolutely I couldn't agree more All right thanks for being with that so much\n[noise] isn't running every morning good afternoon I'm happy that charges have been filed against the third time back in a capital homicide that happened in New castle\nEarlier this week Anthony Kippur stretch with criminal homicide you haven't been arrested yet on the east are actively looking for an even ...

your reputation in this community\nIt is um we are considered one of the premier employers in the area uh we offered top benefits we offered top pay\nA entry pay for us uh in the mills is Nineteen twenty five an hour mhm um and that's entry pay yes and I think that's pretty competitive comparatively speaking\nUm you know just on the drive over here you look all over the place everybody is looking for people ... um if you want something that's going to pay you well and give you a experience and a career\nOr give you opportunities past what you come in as a we are the place to\nGo one of the things I got to tell you guys said I admire about Chris ... is is that you've taken a genuine interest in motivating young people in our community to kind of guide them in the ... in in the right direction and say listen\nAnd this is what I I I genuinely admire about you listen college is for some and to college degrees are expensive you can ... a lot of money and it's for some but there is another path that ... that you bring to people's attention\nThere is an alternative um manufacturing ah getting some experience getting your hands dirty or understanding how things work\nHow the process is work and oh by the way if you get a job at the right employer a lot of times those employers will pay for you to go to school yeah one of those uh you come in USO show some aspiration you stay for a while you create your career\nI'm In there then there's opportunities pass that\nRight Soviet essence if you still are focused so you want to go to college or or get a college degree you can still do that obviously but the question becomes you know if ah well it becomes something that you can do but it also is you don't have that big debt behind you know somebody else's pain is paying for that\nAnd I and I want people to understand that because that's one of the things one I've interviewed Chris Allen in the past that uh I think needs to be out there I mean because Chris is on\nThe forefront of hiring to say we need people that have a certain set of skills\nAnd the work that we have has changed dramatically over the years so I'm going to get into all of that\nAnd I'm going to get in a in a circle on first talk about social work because the ... the the days of the tab a in a slot be or over the type of jobs you're talking about require some degree of expertise and training they're not like the old days and I want you to elaborate on that for me\nI always say that that there is no buddy and the mills anymore shoveling coal into a furnace it doesn't work that way\nA lot of what we do is automated because of the nature of the how the operation works it's dangerous\nUm so a lot of or even your your operator positions are more about ah I'm controlling a computer watching TV monitors to make sure that the part of your process that you're responsible for is\nA running smoothly\nBut it's how it's changing the image that some people might have of\nBasically changing image of what some people might have when they think of working in a factory setting right because factories just like your cell phone has gotten smaller and televisions have changed over the years factories have changed with the artificial intelligence not an automation and requires a pretty\nCertain set of skills to be able to function\nIt does um and you know that some jobs through automation have been eliminated right but a lot of those have shifted\nAnd it requires a higher skill level of course you have to be able to operate a computer right um you have to be able to to to learn to be able to to listen to the directions and apply that to a position um nobody\nWas better at following directions and meet folks I've been married so long I can follow him to a T\nI beg to differ on that [laughter] I just asked of all it's like well maybe you're right because a lot of time she says did you do what I told him I said I totally forgot maybe you got a good point if you talk it out you could tell you exactly right I forgot but see that this is what", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "19"}
