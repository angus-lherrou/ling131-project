Republicans and opened fire on them\nOr I don't remember any of ah I just don't remember Joe Biden or the rest of these people talking about how we need to have more civility\nWhich I I just find that interesting\nI just find it interesting when you see some of the tactics that you've seen obviously you're never going to be able to stop crazy people on either side I mean you're just never going to be able to stop extremist I mean let's be realistic there are people that are mentally\nDisturbed or has some mental issues uh have mental health issues and say you're never going to be able to\nUm that well there's always gonna be people like that there's always going to be people that do what we might consider to be crazy things because they're crazy folks\nYou know and as well as I Do is just crazy folks on both sides are both extremes that there's crazy folks on it but it's much different to me when I hear by talking about civility and I'm thinking to myself I'm not talking about crazy folks I'm Talking about people in the world of politics and some of the things that they've been saying\nThat he didn't say well we should be talking about civility here\nI just find that to be how would you define that I mean I find that to be somewhat odd\nYou know all of a sudden it's like you know of course everything is Trump's fault and this guy is you know obviously they this guy who's\nA a Trump supporter it's Trump's fault that this guy sent out these bombs according to some of these Democrats you know of course everything is Trump's fault that goes without saying Trump's to blame for everything with some of these people but it was never the case you know when you had the congressional shootings and ever said well that's a Obama's fault\nI mean it's just a it's a it's really a double standard it's really a ridiculous double standards and of course your comments are welcome seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven I'm just glad the guy was caught I think it's an amazing process how they were able to figure it all out and capture the guy\nIn his day and age of fingerprints and DNA and ... all the stuff that they can do to try to figure out you know including ... where it was a pipe sold into powder and all that kinda stuff being able to track some of this stuff back perhaps as well\nSo comment seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy Seventy incidentally one of the thing that I Want to touch on today the firing of Megan Kelly from NBC yeah I find it interesting anymore these days it's in a conversation\nYou can say something and it's\nBasically I guess in St Pete some people found it offensive and in essence apologize for the next day\nSincerely apologize for its but that isn't good enough I just find that interesting that you can uh\nDestroy somebody's career for the most part are because they see something that's offended simple folks and in essence\nThe person apologizes ends that's not good enough\nI mean that seems kind of strange to me uh they uh it's it's strange where we're heading in his day and age I mean because\nYou know somebody apologizes can't you accepted say OK learn from it seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven seven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven doesn't work that way anymore Joe on the west side Ronald here on Tiffany boulevard and boredom and hello\nHow you doing wrong good go ahead\nI think a lot of this hostility or or just from your your your uh your the news media come from foreign policy as if they're self a for instance\nWhat a politician wrong and man on TV or a newspaper or has a saying that says\nI'm going to wash your gender and I'm going to fight for it you know uh\nYou know sit there and incidentally I Am so sick ads with any politician that says that I'm In a fight for you because I I don't know I just think that's\n[laughter] I don't buy it I've never bought it most of them are looking out for themselves but go ahead\nNo I agree with you a fact it is that when you run for office you're going to serve your community your state or the government on the federal level and we ever ... military at the farm and the parents that does are fighting for us we have our law enforcement that project so\nWe want our politicians to a server and a and a capacity that's good for the community we don't need them to go fight for us when they run those ads that say I'm going to go fight is still the Hillary Clinton go fight for you who you are\nOn I mean right yeah it's a bunch of BS I I think you bring up a good point I find it frankly very annoying just so you know I find it extremely annoying when they do that kind of stuff\nAnd uh I I don't know I there's so much on the Democratic side I don't agree with you know the this idea of can't we all just get along the incentives no because the the views are so dramatically different\nThink a lot of the Democratic party believes in socialism and I do not so how do I compromise on that I Do not believe in let's tax bigger government higher taxes redistribution of wealth I don't believe in that at all so there is no compromise there for me\nNo there's no compromise for me either on that aspect but the fact that they ah they run out and say they're going to go fight for it that idea into people's parents that there is a fight I've thought we had a dialogue and we were our community we discuss\nThings in an open forum by debate on which way we go with our country\nAnd ah you know we bring up good ideas and we debate them and we figure out you know we we present an idea\nIn a way forward for us to all vote on this whole idea of fighting when they say that\nThis promotes the idea that there is a fight between us and there shouldn't be a fight between us I think it's their fault for doing that and that's the end result with the media are taking their standing next step and then playing it over and over again this is what you get\nYou get some of the lack of their faith that there were in a fight when we're actually just the democracy trying to debate on the way forward for our country\n[noise] All right thanks for your call news radio find Seventy ...

left does all the time you know they'll still Cadillac and then they'll find a Republican that stole the cookie and they'll say see both sides to\nThat right so you know you you deal with reality it is what it is I mean it's a it's not going to change my vote is not going to change your vote I you know I don't think I don't think people have short term memories\nYou gotta you gotta just like you have a whack job on the left it open fire on the Republicans practicing at a baseball game well this guy's a whack job in a lousy bomb builders sending out bombs to all of these people so I mean\nYou got to realize\nThat there are some people that are when you're dealing with large groups of people there are some people that are mentally unstable\nWell my my point Ron is this just a little bit to pat\nBeyond and nobody should know\nYou look at the raw string talks you know the extent right the FBI did to a you know try try to uh\nYou know create this illusion that the Russians ... you know one at one or Trump to win and I mean all the all the you know the ... the the different people approaching them you know Papadopoulos and whatnot you look the extent of that look at the mirror job but they did on cap and all that try to prevent\nIt and uh especially with the with the media is willing participants and that's just I mean I you know what what went on here it's just a little bit to pat for me you know that you know that's my opinion but you're right it's not going to change my vote I voted the other day I set my mind that's an absentee ballot in\n... well see I I just wait till election day you know I mean I'm a truck\nDriver I'm On the road I didn't want to take a chance\nTo write their rights so you know as long as you cast uninformed vote so I think that's\nThat's what matters the most you know you if if you don't know you should just cast to inform vote that's all I'm asking I'm not for these people that say let's get everybody to register well if you're not on top of things then I don't care how many people vote as long as informed people go out and vote I have no problem with that if\nYou don't have a clue then what's the point and voting\nHow about that one um the uh the one poll that we're talking about where a mansion now is behind you points in West Virginia you know that the Republican\nI'm I forgot the name of the guy has a has pulled ahead that's you know it's I mean that's really something\nI don't even think it's funny so I just don't watch it\nI don't expect them to you know I'm not writing letters to NBC that just don't watch it I just uh I don't think it's funny some just had enough of it now if you do and you want to watch it that's cool with me then don't watch it I mean that's America to me America is you can have differing views and differing opinions\nAre on anything\nAnd that is much freedom of speech is about and that's what America is all about\nAnd\nI really don't get to wound up about it one way or the other I realized people got to think differently than me uh you know if we all thought alike we'd all go to the same restaurant tonight or to the same meal well that doesn't happen\nSo well what's a travel on DACA news radio if I can be an hello I'm\nI'd on what you said I can sum up in the way that if people think exactly alike and one of them as a necessity\nAnd it I think the issue here\nIs that most of the things that I said\nI really not a fee for service that their name that will have a higher than\nIt is making a mountain out of a mall or I did find a job that last time I did not around two and then I have a story that will lead the guard at the great depression\nIt is like an employer said that it takes me five days to get people happy\nAnd by friday I mean I make them all happy than the weak and mix them on defense against that I started working on them on Monday again back to the cause and effect so they've had a great economy so he's the cause of the depression and bad and\nSo it kind of me because of the Obama because Obama had nothing much happening the upside down logic and there's something where a good quality that good qualities that fund is back\nThere you go uh there there you go but I mean what do you make of this political correctness anymore I mean in all seriousness I don't but Megan Kelly getting fired I mean she apologized sincerely the next day why isn't that good enough anymore\nYeah right but it will have to understand the odd it you know the meaning of ... and ... if it didn't sound that in Soviet Union that somebody said oh this is not correct you're putting out status taste that good at\nSo the higher up pointed out that it is all it can be good at if you don't go along with your kid at the guy that if you wanted to save your life\nSo far they can look at a desk with me is that ignored that reality and that becomes a okay because of that but yet it is a shame that it is happening in the United states [noise]\n[noise] well I'm troubled by the direction some of this stuff goes you know I mean I like I said I good when Roseanne bin ... said what she said and\nThen to or Cathy Griffin was so severed head of Trump you know sometimes people do a joke and bombs or it isn't funny or it's offensive and all you can do is apologize for it I'm not necessarily saying oh Cathy Griffin we should fire from the New Year's eve show on CNN\nA ... with lots of fire Roseanne from her show let's fire Megan Kelly the answer isn't always capital punishment is if you will as far as firing people from their\nHow they make a living in our livelihood at some point I'm surprised that we can't accept an apology that so that's what I find even more troubling that people can say okay the person apologized what more do you want them to do\nWith people who've Mac Yorkshire now that are funded by the whole idea of the joke is that it can be out fast and so it's just that apologizing it is like me saying when I'm driving that caught it may shaken that but I should not be a part of I think for the Don Rickles mad\n... well now wait a minute or some of the jokes that you've told on the show are so bad I think you should apologize for him\nMad at somebody should make me a ... in the United socialist I'm\nMad as well I'm just saying I'm just saying they weren't that funny they were bad jokes you should have better writers for your comment I live in a bad deal that my especially with the but uh\nSee I I'm just a a it's like you know when they try to prevent conservative speakers from speaking at college campuses well here's my novel idea let them speak and if you don't want to go then don't go\nI'm not one that says let's disrupt somebody's ability to express their point of view let's say you know when you have these liberal people that want to prevent a conservative speaker from speaking\nAnd or want to disrupt it was screaming and hollering I don't go for that at all that's what troubles me more let the person speaking if you don't like what they're saying just don't attend it's as simple as that\nI mean surely as simple as that\nThat's consistent with this election is communist mentality you have to create to walk that nobody can get out and read that ideology so facts that they have to shout everybody down our beat them up so they don't speak\nThat is the equal and it was that you get paid for and I'm getting out the families of these I guess can not get out there that that was so it is entirely consistent with that totally go down to a mentality and regimes that your heart has as much danger as your physical\nAction so they can be because some of the people to see the light that cannot afford to do that\nRight but all you can do is apologize thank you Dr ... shooting John in Salem Ron bird news radio ... so do you do what he can be on your on your\nEnron I think money is behind making Kelly's firing more than anything\nYou know what you might be right 'cause ... her show was having some bumps in the road as far as his success and twenty five million a year or so\nShe's never full rating and she went over there she had a good ... going on right then she got into it you think back a few years a couple of years she got into Donald Trump and one of the debates\nAnd then washed her you know literally millions of people I Know I Know a lot of people that used to be making Kelly fans because you turn them on candidate Trump\nBack then and now you know they kind of situation where they paid\nOr a bunch of money spent trying to get ratings of a certain level\nShe hasn't been able to

use but we were able to immediately get them in service in on the road and uh we we didn't have to send any additional money out that in the car and we were able to put those two cars in service and on the road for less than what a new vehicle would have cost\nRight and I but I Want to emphasize to the people in Jackson township celebrity that you're asking for which is a small if he is money just to try\nAnd so it keeps the department's continuing to operate\nYou're not looking to buy anything or change anything other than what you're already doing I mean it solely just to maintain what you're doing currently you know what the people in Jackson township to understand what you're doing currently is running an efficient department by getting the most for your dollar when it comes to these cruisers and transferring the equipment\nI mean when I read this stuff I say this guy's a good steward of taxpayers' dollars I ... I start start right there\nAnd then you're in apartments in in most cases I mean you're a you know you're an active police chief I mean it ... you are out there and you write tickets and you do things outside of being police chief but for the most part you have\nA I don't want to alert criminals or anything you have one guy on the road for the most part are one guy in a part timer on the road it isn't a huge departments so this is about maintaining that level of safety which are you in in response time correct chief\nThat is absolutely true Iran or we are a department of five fulltime

of the ways of leading by example uh but not all that we just don't have the money to be able to put on extra people in order to continue with the patrol that we're doing in order to provide the uh seven days a week twenty four hour day three hundred and sixty five days or\nUm we also supplement our a police force with a part time officers and reserve officers are we couldn't get along without a they're a help um but again I reserve officers or do they do their time\nUh in order to help to part of their training and uh that are too uh but extra patrols on the road or at least put\nToo many cars on the road or to try to provide officer safety so yeah we are doing everything that we can to try to uh for the head with the money that we have um another thing that we do is we also participate in the ... task force\nOn the advantage there is is that the passport then provide us with funding for local patrol so at that point it also that provide me with some additional funding at no cost to the township taxpayers to provide the services that they need and that we want to\nProvide for them right but I Want to I I Want people now in Jackson township you know that in that in essence this this is this levee would generate a whopping one hundred and thirty eight thousand six hundred and two dollars which is the amount of money\nThat they need in Jackson township just to maintain nothing additional just to maintain the services and the equipment that they have right now\nThat they've been ... and you know I sit back folks and I'm the I'm the first guy I Am a stickler on tax dollars and all that kind of stuff I make no bones about it if I Lived in Jackson township I Would vote for this levee\nIn as I watched the chief on television the other night I sat back and I turned to my wife and I said that was the most compelling presentation\nThat I've seen in many years as to as to why somebody should support electric he's not asking for anymore which you know I ... which is surprising he's just asking for the bare minimum to maintain his department's\nWhich is a small departments to answer calls for their local citizens\nAnd he's the guy that gets out of the office you know has has has cruiser goes out and and the does policing an answers calls just as well as the assistant chief I mean you guys aren't sitting around behind a desk all the time you're actively involved in your community\nWe definitely are that court that part of community policing which I strive for want to continue to provide 'em the other thing is is that not only do we have the uh twenty three hundred or so residents that uh we have to serve and protect\nBut we also have a rather large a business community as well we actually provide services for about two hundred and Fifteen businesses\nWhich includes five major trucking companies are a couple of steel companies are aluminum company uh her food things remembered warehouse Macy's warehouse so our daytime an afternoon populations swell life potentially a ... you know so of course with that\nBritish more crime to our community as well and of course that more and more taxes are far officers\nWrite that one of the reasons that uh myself in that we have to get out there and we have to be a proactive and our policing as well\nRight I mean there's a lot of it when I drive through Jackson township there's a lot of businesses grow growing out there you have the the uh call before you dig service it's out there you are the ... food so it's\nI I think expanding out by Bailey road you also have the fed ex out there at the Macy's whereas these are big operations\nThat are in Jackson township and there's a lot of people that are out there during the work day in your department has to deal with an answer these calls a ... and uh and ... it ... it is something that is vital I think for the development of future business coming to your community\nAs well as for homeowners that\nThat to call in need a assistant so I mean you guys are ... you know when we talk about police officers I have a world of respect for your you and you guys this department because\nYou know you're out there pretty much a [laughter] I'm you're oh you're you're back ups twenty minutes away or whatever I mean you know one thing I like about you is you almost have a little bit of regional association going on with a Milton township in with the sheriff's departments are assisting you guys as well correct\nAbsolutely we all work together and ah you know of course as you said earlier you know there are times when we only have one vehicle or one car out so we certainly as some of the other agencies in our a neighboring community so we do to them and we do rely\nOn or having assistance from ... department the sheriff's office down off the house so we do have a lot of uh uh you know what you said as far as regional as Asia where we definitely work together because\nQuite obviously when we're out there and there's something going or why we ... we really don't care what color the uniform is as long as there's somebody to come out there and give us an\nRight and you're obviously handling auto accidents you know within your community with heavy traffic there during the day with all of these businesses out there in addition to uh just as a side note backing up you know the patrol in many cases on major accidents out on the freeway which goes through a good section of your community\nAbsolutely does that we are out there on almost all of those calls because we are close by so we're always the first responders because for all of the first and a lot of times they don't have somebody available so we're the ones that are actually\nOut there and we had what five fatalities I Believe that this year alone not on the interstate as well as we also have one of the ... is turnpike interchange is right here in Jackson as well\n[noise] yeah I just don't I look at it and the and I look at I look at a fire departments that is just eats efficiently run you know I\nI I'm a big fan of ah are no he'll out in large town I think he's running a great community out there as well and I and I look at that and I say that's what I'm looking for in a community and I look at Jackson township and I look at\nThe fire department that function so well and I look at a police departments that is that is really a actor you know everyone actively involved on everything going on in a community\nI don't want to say is barebones but pretty close to barebones and asked for and asked for nothing more than a a small sum of money to keep\nThings going with a you know so when you call somebody responds to whatever that that call might be and that's why you know when I talk about taxes and that kind of stuff I say one hundred percent if I Lived in Jackson township I Would vote yes on your levy it truly is a small price to pay\nA for the continuation of your department and the continuation of a of the response time and just a public service\nThat ah that that it performs I Can't imagine a community of your size and ... with with that number of businesses are not to you know not having an officer on the road at all times\nI get on out in San election day or if you're doing early voting and vote to support and keep your ah your police departments are going it's a vital interest when you have such an efficient department and frankly a well run township to a large extent you know which is hats off to your trust he says all\nThat well cheap tie on thank you for your time and I appreciate your coming on the program\nThank you very much Ron I certainly appreciate it and uh British at your support today\nAll right thank you chief pressured as our I make sure you get on a ... if you live in Jackson

I fully understand ... bladders story yeah what's on your mind about Megan Kelly yes\nAnd I watched your show since she left Fox just because I don't have cable t._v. anymore but uh I'm\nNow why don't you get cable t._v. anymore to expensive\nIt got too expensive and you know you only there's there's probably ... percent of the channels I Would never think to watch anyhow so uh we just have the time is on crime uh-huh\nAnd you got your local a local channels right off the airwaves with an antenna and I would assume\nYeah I but I only get one channel where I'm at I live in a bowl so uh my antenna doesn't work that well so\nWhat what are you in LA ladies and gentlemen this man just met met it on the air his intent it doesn't work that well isn't that interesting um well maybe you need a bigger antenna\nThat I've heard that All right so I'm just a suggestion [laughter]\nOr you got to get your antenna outside and higher there's the secret\nFor yeah I'll give it a try so just pitching it randomly up into my attic you don't think that was meant out maybe now right now to get out\nThere yeah on a chimney or somewhere or ... yeah it has to be outside aimed towards ... where most of the towers are for now the matters that advice\nRight there is worth a considerable weight that I went through here\nI well I Apologize for that but I'm Serious about that if you if you put it on your roof and aim it towards well ... boulevard and south avenue in that area because all the towers her in a general area and you'll pick it up much better you'll probably pick up more stations than he ever knew\nIf you get an antenna you get what you pay for when it comes to an antenna there's a lot of people that are going in that direction though that to you that you're talking about they're trying to cut their bills and uh and that's\nIt's tough I mean the living expenses are tough these days anyway go ahead with your comments\nWell Megan Kelly I what I think it's happened over the years is the definition of racism has taken a shift where we're not talking about like he didn't say that\nLike black people were like three fifth person or they're not smart enough to vote or fly you know aircraft are I mean that it not\nOh she said she ... declared was her experience for me it was a child and an opinion about it on a on a show that I gather is a forum where people exchange ideas and have discussions\nWell there is a which he did write this segment we're going to be fired for it\nYeah where she said basically when I'm as a kid if you had black face or white face a for Halloween and you're playing a character it wasn't a big deal but to you know playing a character or whatever that character might be and that's basically what she said and with that being aside that offended some people you're saying that\nThe next day she genuinely and sincerely apologize time of year but that's not good enough anymore\nWell if you're going to have a show where your your supposedly having an exchange of ideas\nAnd someone could have you know offered a a counter to that and said well you know from my perspective\nHere some reasons why I don't think that's appropriate anymore in this day and age and and maybe they could have had a a a little discussion about it and that and that would have been I think health fooling and Libya informative some people and maybe it would have changed her mind on this or maybe it wouldn't but\nI don't see what she said as being racist she did not say that right blacks or any other races inferior to anybody else but uh\nUh here she goes well lose your job\nOr you know we are in a ... we are in such a politically correct society almost to an extreme\nSo that when you say something stupid you think's funny whether you're Roseanne Barr or whether you're Megan Kelly or whether you are what uh what was a girl on um [noise] that held up Trump's severed head about a bad joke there ... and even if you apologize\nIsn't good enough anymore even if you simply say well I'm Sorry live and learn that isn't good enough and now you're fired I don't go along with that mentality at all I think ...\nTo all of free free money that you can I'm troubled by that too many people are taking advantage of Social Security disability workers' comp and these things\nAnd and the trouble ... the real answer to our immigration problem you want to get rid of ants don't leave your sugar bowl open right\nAnd and we have we give it away so easy on in the country that that's what's drawing people here there there's no mass migration to Mexico because well the economy's not able to support it but in in Mexico if you don't work you don't eat you know they don't have their their socialist country\nCountries are that way if you don't you're right and ...\nAnd ... people may be poor but by God they get up every day and find something to do right find some way to scratch out a living\nNow they don't have a drug problem because the minute you first they can't afford it\nBut if you wanted to start helping paint down in Mexico that lasts about a week because then you're dead mhm yeah you're right we don't ... they don't have a they don't have a what we call it a safety net right is is a naval enables that uh all the problems in our country\nI write I if you look back at the great society that Johnson created it it's been a great mistake it as\nIt has taken away a responsibility for individual behavior and consequences to individual behavior and it's created a growing segment of society that ah don't suffer consequences for the decisions they make and it's troubling to me because I said a million times do you folks and I mean it's\nEvery day you should thank God you were born in this country and given the opportunities that are here and I feel that so many of these people that don't take advantage of them are see that their kids take advantage of\nA you know you can you are you doing well in high school are going to vocational school and learning a skill or trade you can go to college for free with the right grades and athletic ability you can go to a vocational school and high school learn a skill or trade and get a great job when you graduate high school and I mean a great job\nYou can be an adult and then say okay at Nineteen or twenty I screwed up I'm going to go to\nMoan and county current technical center tc tc and and for relatively inexpensive amount learn a skill or trade that's in high demand and make sixty Seventy thousand dollars today\nThis is a great country of opportunities but you have a segment of our society that chooses not to take advantage of them they don't see that their kids go to school they don't see that they\nDo their homework they don't put a value on education\nThat no one should be dropping out in this day and age ... they don't parents don't emphasize education they don't teach by example they don't teach your work ethic\nA that's troubling to me you have forty percent of the kids that are born out of wedlock or these days nobody's getting married any more you got to changing society and I would argue not for the better and that's why we got the problems that we have\nBut everything changes when it when you get the bill everything changes when all of a sudden\nYou know it's just like for years when the employer paid health care people had no concept of what healthcare costs they have no concept like you said a buddy of mine that self employed pays one thousand three hundred and fifty dollars a month starting in January for a health plan with a five thousand dollar deductible\nSo when you want to say to yourself well this is how much I make an hour but I get healthcare health care's expensive you know so if your employers paying half of it are two thirds of it you're lucky but you got people bitch and if they got to pay a hundred dollars a month they have no concept of what healthcare\nCosts none zero that's true like already when I get going All right I mean at that and that's what I find very troubling yeah I mean people just takes so much for granted\nAnd so they you\nKnow they just think they they just take a lot for granted basically at what these local politicians and other group of local politicians and when I met with people from GM about the future lords and ... other than making yourself look good what's the point they're not going to tell you anything period\nI mean you're going to come back you're not going to do any more just like when I was reading about the last group that was up there and they basically said well the cars and selling its the marketplace and they're not going to tell you what their plans are with\nThe facility they're just not going to tell you\nGood glad to hear see you later bye And that's going to be the end of it\nSo I don't know why that why you know you have the senators go up there and Tim Ryan call and these\nGuys go up there sometimes I think just about them trying to look good to the to the constituents in voters do you have these guys doing some Trump rally wanting to wanting to say or promises not cap or something like that I'm thinking to myself Trump has done more for you guys\nAs far as ... getting rid of NAFTA and renegotiating it as far as terrorists are concerned to have disincentives for these companies to go to Mexico and bring product back in the NAFTA change is a dramatic change\nThat can benefit everyone at these local plants and you're going to go bitch to him about it you should be applauding him because nobody does done more than this guy has done\nSeven to nine Ninety nine Seventy seven we take calls 'til six tonight I'll be here till seven Dr factor it's six Seventy nine Ninety nine Seventy seven five\n[noise] with only type a husky ...

think\nOh yes yes I Do remember that never mind I Do remember that yeah\nYeah yeah I got a couple of things out of time well you know what I Want to do a lot of your last caller I'm and I\nHad it he had it down I mean I agree with him one hundred percent and if he's still listening I also have an antenna and if he gets one on his roof it'll get thirty forty channels ...\nLet me give you a little of my uh ... or you know my FCC licensing you know and all of that kind of stuff the high ... if you put your antenna outside\nThe higher you get at the better you get a digital signals coming off of towers are the you either get them or you don't ... and they break up are really easy but it's a A R antenna towards south avenue in Middleton boulevard and you should be able to pick up a number of stations\nAnd actually being able to pick up Pittsburgh to hang on a second I'm not come back after the break at five alright funny guy more time we'll be back say to you\nKnow five ... a long shot their brothers find heart Rory road can be used radio five seven you Katie yes young south [noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Michelle fan than after five days of new to the authorities think they have the man\nIs from fourteen pipe bombs to critics of President Trump\nFifty six year old Caesar say I was charged with five federal counts that linked him to more than a dozen improvised explosive devices mailed to prominent Democrats around the country FBI Director Christopher Wray said analysts found a key clue on one of them\nWell it's like I Want I Want said\nI think Trump is thin skinned and a doctor called me and said no he's not he's thick skin look at all of the abuse he takes on a day to day hour by hour basis from all of the media with the exception maybe a Fox you know and all you do share people bitch about Fox and here's a shocker for you if it wasn't for Fox\nThere there wouldn't be any any network that at a conservative bent to it I mean everything else is it wouldn't even exist saw people lose about Fox incidentally\nWith the highest ratings of any of 'em but ah but ah all they do is is complain about it was a doc said Trump is thick skin well you don't want Trump to agree\nI agree with that dark he does that thick skin because he can stand up in his\nMind rather than back down like these other politicians do\nWith this scandal\nWhile I Would say there's Josh you have Joe Biden say said we need more civility in politics after these bombs were sent out you'd ever Joe Biden say that when Maxine Waters was saying getting their face get the holler out I'm On their eating you never heard\nJoe Biden said that when Eric Holder said kick him you never hear Joe Biden say that when Hillary Clinton saying you can't be civil to these people yeah\nYeah or or or or any of that rage yeah you ever heard it from Joe Biden about that\nWe don't we don't get outraged like they provoke the left to be outraged mhm we just roll with it\nBut ... but my point being is you don't see you know by ... about this\nWell a comment that I get sick and tired of hearing folks as is common why can't we all just reached common ground I got news for you we're not going to reach common ground because one side is believes in socialism and the other side believes in capitalism and you know one side believes in more government more taxes socialism\n... a redistribution of money and the other side believes in the best social programs are good job of fishing government smaller governments borders uh in all this kind of stuff is so the sides are so far apart they're never going to find common ground if you can't find common ground as Americans\nThat the people here are here illegally shouldn't be able to vote the people that want to come into our country should have to come in legally not illegally\nUh I don't know if you can't reach common ground on that I don't know what it's gonna take when you've got Democrats who don't believe in ice don't believe in borders believe a legal should be able to vote\nI don't think you can reach common ground on that it's so damn bizarre\nWith what is going on now we should be able to reach common ground because of what is happening under a Trump with\nWith the economy going the way it is and there's more jobs available now than there are unemployed evil that should bring us together that should bring these\n... socialism does not work right apple isn't does\nReducing rigid regulations does dropping taxes does all this stuff works it obviously does\nThey are on old President Obama made fun of candidate Trump when he said I Want to get the economy at four or five percent he he literally\nIt into a joke and yeah now what now he's\nNow now now where it's at one point ... GDP and he did a damn quick\nUh and and he was making it into like Obama was acting like it was a joke and when Trump said I'm going to bring manufacturing back Obama rode off manufacturing and basically said get over it Trump is you're taking manufacturing and its soaring in America again\nSo they have very people that said he'll never knew how to manufacturing he'll never do that on GDP\nDon't come foreign said man I was dead wrong because he is doing that and and you don't hear\nThe shared browns and Tim Ryan saying hey you know what maybe he maybe these tax cuts that really did make an effect on the economy and maybe cutting regulations did make an effect on the economy\nAnd boy take a look we got more jobs than we have unemployed people and take a look at how things are going but now I Know you can't do that you can't be an American the party won't accept that that's what's wrong in America today\nI agree hey by the bomber guy that they found yeah did you did you happen to see the pictures of his van yes\nDoes that not look professionally done you\nKnow it looks like a nut job to me\nI mean it just looks like a ... it's not random stickers is rap I mean it's I don't think it's a poster but I but but he's ... he's crazy he lives\nWhere he lives is not exactly a red area it would have been vandalized for crying out loud I Believe he's a he's a pawn\nI Know I don't believe in ... All right did you hear it here rush today I don't buy it for a second I don't buy that for a second and I and I didn't hear rushed to that no\nThere was a lady that called in and saw is Facebook before they took it down and he had a picture Kathy Griffin is with Donald Trump that long Trump's head and\nAlso saying about let's turn Florida blue again we can\nRequire around I I don't I don't know I like and down even seen any of that\n... I'm going to say it again I don't know why people can't accept that there are people that are mentally unstable in in the masses do crazy things the guy that went and shot the Republicans when they were practicing baseball this guy sending out the pipe bombs they're mentally unstable people that are ... but\nMost people will never understand uh you know you see it with a lot of actresses stalkers and this kind of stuff there's just a lot of mentally unstable people just accept\nAll add All right All right I'm done with you you didn't hear too much about that guy they are I got up the Republicans\nSee you later after re in Youngstown hello\nHey [noise] yesterday at four forty five on your program you had to name Jerry on your ... as he mentioned that he had his second water meter\nNo you you know you got to ... ... ... when he goes on and waters this grass and that kind of stuff you can actually call the water department and they'll put it in the second thing for you\nYeah it it does it work because I put one in myself\nBut to me to put it in and it went down and talk to me who is that the one who\nIs in charge of all the leaders and that say why is it why my being charged for this lawyer that's going on say it is because you had consumed doubting gallons yet so so the five hundred again and you can eat duck that use what eight hundred gallons you can't eat that\n... that's how it works the who to talk to you about this and I said my neighbor but it doesn't work so if anybody's going to do that it can be a commercial or use that for a home I get fruit trees a guard\nAt the same thing ... what you're talking about do you ... they put an outside meter for you that doesn't get charged sewage if your water your grass or the stuff outside is that accurate yes or no\nNo that's that's totally wrong you used to charge for it unless you use a thousand gallon\nI understand I'm not talking about charges I'm asking you to answer that simple question do you put in a second you had been put in a second meter that is in charge sewage if it's for outside purposes only that the the question is how to yeah to it All right and from that era charge what a minimum charge\nFor that for that meat or if you will like Fifteen or sixteen dollars or whatever amounts to is that about ...\nInstalled it in a\nI don't know the I don't know the EU and so I think the water part are you in Youngstown city water yes All right so you get a minimum water bill with that meat or is that correct\n[noise] that he didn't mention that he's in charge of it he says and to use a thousand gallons period you understand that\nI understand that but it probably was no sewage charge on it because you put in a second meter for outside use\nYeah that's the reason I put it in so I can enjoy the surge try it didn't make no difference\nAlright ... everyone else I Know it does so I don't know how to explain it to you I Know people who have who have\nManaged to down there and tried to I mean if he has a four or five letters\nTo his name was new vows that it's a you announce it All right uh that it got it right by\nIran ear Craig and Canfield save me hello\nYou're on it's like crazy friday [noise] um\nI I just wanted to thank you and you're doing a great service today for what you're talking about with you know this guy with the bombs and everything else um [noise]\nYou know the ... this is not exclusive to Republicans and Democrats say things and people go out and do crazy things with Democrats say things and people were going to do crazy things whether you're a Democrat or Republican\nI'm with you I think this guy was obviously a very troubled and the fact that he supported President Trump or anybody else or any other Republican it's completely irrelevant I think we can have a conversation about the tone of politics and hateful things that both sides say against each other but somehow come out and say\nYou know ... some you know crazy ... on the left or the writer or whatever uh it's just intangible and the people that say that they they just need to stop them kind of take a long look at themselves because there's not that going on it's just a lot of mentally unstable people in the world but fortunately in what happens\nOh it's a good while supplies laugh\nAll happening when at the eastern all tomorrow on\nOur rights something to do tomorrow on a rainy day at the end of all\nThank you Joe later All right so let's go next to Tom in aisles\nHe got it made this twenty minute than our work hours maybe\nIt's pretty grueling I Want you to know I mean you know a lot on the edge of\nJumping from one thing to do well and I'm like a physician I'm going from one operating room to the next\nAnd you do a good job you know what I mean Tom

C I hurt us on the radio station calling that that number eight five five eight to eight thin\nAnd we'll put a fifty dollar gift card to side good towards any guarantee broken\nSo the initial if you're if you're one of those people the first caller served that visit is free\nCorrect is there's not a lot of its eyes is absolutely no cars\nSo I got over ... service while the first thing I tell everybody this Ron is it was me come in and take a look at it I Love skeptics idea was skeptics all the time people come and see you know doc I've never heard of before but here's the thing I tell people there's never pressure obligation if somebody comes in as I say I want to go home and digested it may not be for me we're never going to give them ... most people tell me\nOnce they start to understand that and they see how this thing works is you know what\nI Want to go forward I Want to start the process\nBecause I Want to get the weight off till changed my life\nOne of the keys there is is the person needs to realize they need to wait to come off they have to be somewhat motivated to right Dr factor\nDo you know the first thing in anything you know whether you're you're ... you're trying to stop smoking whatever it may be as you have\nTo realize there's an issue there being around I meet people all the time and when people come and this is what they tell me all the time I had done a lot of programs before people get to the situation especially if they get a little bit older I Can't figure out how to get the weight off you know they are so much advice that or do I go to a gym do I do pre packaged foods in a nice thing is there's no pre packaged foods that you asked that question earlier\nBut this is what people tell me when they come out and this is the first time this makes sense to me once they understand the science behind weight loss because a lot of what we've been pot run just doesn't work and I tell people right now there's more dire programs out there is more gyms out there there's more you know supplementation out there's more surgeries going on there for weight loss yet\nIn our country right now we're getting heavier and heavier and a lot of it is is not their fault\nIt's of epidemic proportions like I say that's increasing type two diabetes in our country that's also increasing colon cancer there's so many affects the being overweight but it has on your knees and so many other things that if you deal with it you can avoid these issues and or get off some of the medications you might beyond\nThat well let me see that all the time and I'm In a region successor I right now is pretty amazing though my readers his game and the other day was from Frank he says you know\nHe said I heard you on the radio he came and took an actress that did the consultations as what he says his I started your program he said I Hope all is well I just wanted you know today that I'm doing amazingly well I went back to my medical doctor and I had excellent results my a one seat it's a test they run run for in a lame it starts with people that are diabetics\nAnything under six major no longer a diabetic he's a five point three okay keep the money was a full blown diabetic\nFasting glucose ... too which is very very good at ... and a Fifteen point seven his cholesterol down to one forty four he was up to twenty earlier\nIn his ACL now LDL or with the normal range is he says I Can't believe how well this has worked for me this was life changing thank you so much Dr ... and in Iran we get success stories like this all the time so you mentioned earlier you are so many people out there on medications right now blood pressure diabetes medication arthritis medication\nMedications for their got medications for acid reflux and what we see almost every single time when those weights starts to come down on\nThose very patients go back to the doctors and the dogs are taking them off the medication because the body's working here on the way it's supposed to and\nYou know what you don't have the expense of those medications anymore you don't have the side effects of those medications anymore Dr factor is just your body basically being where it needs to be and where it should be to take care of yourself in in this\nNow I Want to ask you something when you talk about this talk to our listeners this doctor factor I'm not going to be eating just lettuce and I got to go to the gym for two hours a day\nHot that Greg Greg question you know I Love exercise I think you and I talked about this last time and here's the reality is that exercising to lose weight doesn't work and I'm going to die for Ninety nine percent of the population I'm going to say the reason why okay\nI can go out and I can go for a run for an hour okay and my age I'm I'm fairly good shape for my age I'm not going to get my age over the year but I burn about three fifty to four hundred calories I told you this last time by the time I get them having dinner that night have already consume that amount of calories\nSo I'm never to deficit so I Love exercise but on our program it's not required I'm going to say that again it's not required you're gonna eat real food nutrition is just not lettuce it's lean proteins is fruits and vegetables is real whole food nutrition\nAnd you're going to take our high and customize supplementation and one that's going to do Ron is get the body the polls and those fat stores or once we can get the body becoming a fat burger versus the sugar burn\nThe end result is about a half a pound a day comes off to our average patient and it's amazing people tell me all the time when I get on the scale and that waits come in time in its motivating really at San\nDo people talk to you and say you know hey I'm not hungry anymore and I I mean they don't have the usual problems that they have another diets ...\nThe thing is we have to address that and that's one of the components we address the most weight loss programs it's willpower over science yeah I'm going to wake up and I'm trying to be on a dime\nSo we address as we get the hormones working better we help decrease hunger with very high in supplementation the important thing is there's no stimulants so not putting any it's dangerous in the ... and we get the toxins out we hydrate the body and usually within about two to three days this is what are patients tell us\nThe hunger is going on I have some patients they dock I mean it's like eating anymore we still want to put good whole foods nutrition in their body\nRight and it and this isn't done with drugs or anything it's supplementation as you\nWrite a lowly there's no dangerous drugs and the reason is all the medications either on in the ... aren't real real safe and when you see every couple of years the FDA comes in the polls on this stuff off the mark and\nYou know there's a reason right now that you know a lot of the major health systems either a lot of Dodgers either when someone comes in has a heart prop on someone's a diabetic when someone's on insulin they don't want to put them on hardcore medications they will send those patients stuff because they know our program works\nAh and I just want to get that off are out there that you mentioned the special offer available today for our listeners here on the radio so if you are one of the first twenty callers right Dr factor to call the number that I'm going to give out you're going to be eligible for free no obligation in office review of this revolutionary weight loss system\nReview includes a complete overview

card go towards any of their guaranteed programs is available to you right now is absolutely no\nCost so here's the phone number that you want to call it's eight five five eight to eight Finn that's eight five five eight to eight Finn\nEight five five eight to eight eight four four six eight five five eight to eight eight for for six that's\nThe number that your call if you want to take advantage of this when people when when people come in Dr factor\n[noise] you know this is the hardest part is for somebody to ... to say I'm going to make that commitment to myself to be healthy to feel better to look better to to make that commitment to yourself\n[noise] one thousand dollars now\nNationwide word money to two hundred two hundred you'll get a tank confirming ... radio in\nSt or data and let's rates apply in this nationwide guns that money should two hundred and two hundred [noise]\nEven no other it's my pleasure welcome back to our program Dr back to things haven't worked other diets you got to make that commitment to yourself and not be afraid to take the first step to making something happening for yourself that's the key for\nOr on the key is ... you're a hundred percent right the problem is people no one likes to fail and I can't tell you how many times people started died since then what I mean it it's very very common thing is\nIs is really challenging to lose weight I see people every single day it's a doc I'd been all the big box programs I board of the food I've been to the doctors before I've tried stuff over the counter stuff I see in the local grocery stores or drug stores\nAnd it just doesn't work right now they need to do something different and I said this before we utilize the twenty first century approach so that was the what we want people to do and the reason we want them to take that drive and I'm telling you\nAnd I always say this is somebody was diagnosed with cancer and the best doctor in the world for cancer was located you know a couple of hours away what would you get in a car and driving engine of course I Would I Do anything to save my life\nHowever here becomes the issue though people need\nSystem and when when they come in and we sit down with Iran we share this with him their eyes light up it's the I never heard this before I've never seen this before\nAnd when they get on their own scale at home run and they started to see way coming up they're ... they're motivated so that first step in that consultation is we want to find out if there are a good fit what's going on where they've been what their goal is we'll body composition analysis and then run at that point we feel that we can help them\nFinn which is eight five five eight to eight eight for for six or eight eight five five eight to eight eight for for six\nAnd the keypad call now and to take advantage of it some in the lead doctor factor know that you're interested in really taken a first step do you guys people when you say okay you give them a program to say when you know you're at home what about when somebody goes out to eat or says\nDoc I got to go out and grab a court to lunch here's my choice a triple layer Burger King or McDonald's\nSay died um we do and that's the beauty of our program too but I also want to get her labs that are real quick answer that question they can always go on and find out more at the RV ACT O. R. dot com\nYou're gonna see success stories you'll find out a little more about the program to answer your question though the beauty of this Ron is you're able to eat out okay most weight loss programs you can't do that and we teach you how to navigate that I have some people that are in cells that are on the road all the time that worked shift work\nWhere they just can't ... meals and that's the nice thing about the program so yes you can go to the places you name we just teach you how to order and that's really the key it's hard to navigate it would do or in the portion date\nRights is there some exercise involved\nGreat question exercises purely optional I Love exercise I'm a former athletes are like exercise I like to get out there I go for your dog is but here's the prom and hands I think I talked about this on a Pryor show\nYou know the people everybody believes that you have to exercise more and eat less to lose weight the problem is we can exercise long enough\nAnd that becomes the issue so the answer your question I think everybody should take a walk the let's get the weight that first let's do it for mental acuity less deliver cardiovascular let's do it for your joints but if you're doing it to get the weight off I'll tell you what it becomes very cumbersome and I'll tell you this you know when people coming to see me they said doc\nWhen I go to my medical doctor and the doctor tells me to go to go to a gym or no way a program you know heavy exercise program I don't know enough energy to get through the day my joints hurt I'm overweight I have arthritis so most of these people can't you know they can't do the exercise we want to get the weight off first and then get you back either exercise in\n... so you see actually people lose weight then start wanting the water or indoor or you know because they can\nAsk the key 'cause you have to move you know exercise is so important that the problem is we're not exercising to get the weight off that's the key\nDid you know Dr backed or if you've got all that weight on and you're taking steps you know that can lead to the replacement some problems like that as well serious issue we see\nThat all the time back problems and he ... his problems and thing is as you get that way down I'm telling you the inflammation goes down in the body I Can't tell you how many times that people say why to my joints feel so much better and it's not just the weight loss weight loss helps that's common sense it's the inflammation and what our program does is it decreases I learned from nation\nTalk to me just real briefly about the transformation it happens to people physically when they achieve these goals and they look at themselves and they got to feel better about they're\nJust they're being was unbelievable I mean from a physical aspect I mean you're going to see a difference and I tell people go home state in the mirror take up a picture of yourself obviously don't share it with everybody but take a picture of yourself and then once you lose the weight take another picture it's amazing the these these the transformations are amazing most people want to take that weight off in their stomach their ... their heads\nThe other thing is there's an emotional component to this to Ron were when they get the weight off they feel so much better emotionally and we hear that time and time psychologically oh better about myself and when you feel better about yourself guess what life is better\nAll right what's the offer teller Alice ...\nWe're up against the clock though but here's the thing and I encourage you right now pick that phone up and give us a call give me that opportunity to share with your program that is literally changed thousands of lives\nIf you're one of the first twenty cars they call the number I'm going to give out you're going to be eligible for the free no obligation in office review I'm a sit down with your body composition analysis and if I feel I can help you I'm going to tell you that sign courage you pick up that phone call right now eight five five eight to eight thin\nIt's eight five five eight to eight eight for for six and the iPad or you can always find out more at the ... also too you can use a promo code radio fifty\nAnd what that means if you come in and give us a promo code will put a fifty dollar gift card to good towards any of our guarantee programs and if you have a friend or family member spouse and you want to bring them with you and then natural consultation we have to schedule that we will actually double that coupon to a hundred dollars per person\nAre just so people do it's B.
