Turkey\nIs so many unions indoors the Democrats for the love of God I don't understand why\nThe doors Democrats why because of the ... well let's put it this way I look back up the union leadership endorses Democrats and I really don't understand why so it it's Trump to renegotiate trade deals it's Trump that did the terrorists\nAs a result of this stuff domestic steel\nIs booming as a result of its workers are getting fourteen percent wage increases as a result of it and this is big workers don't have to pay a premium for their health care insurance so now if you're a United steel worker\nWould you say boy I better get out and make sure I vote for the Democrats\n\nWould you say I better make sure I get out and I want Nancy Pelosi running the show\nChuck Schumer now I'm Serious if your United steel worker 'cause this is what's\nUnion so you know to the Democratic stuff wouldn't be sitting there saying well wait a minute\nTo renegotiate the trade deal sea being President Trump wait a minute he put on tariffs so that we could stop this dumping and as a result of that my job is solid I got a fourteen per cent raise and I don't have to pay for my health care it's a benefit I'd have to contribute to the cost of it\nYeah\nWe better make sure we elect Democrats so that we can stop this stuff\n[laughter] seriously you know another thing he did a\nTrump has said you got these caravans that are coming to the U.S border\nIncidentally thousands of Honduran or immigrants or migrants I should say heading towards the U.S Mexico border reportedly on the move again once to despite warnings to turn back from their own country and President Trump the caravan of around two thousand people was walking through a light rain\nOn Wednesday afternoon\nGroup's numbers have snowball since about one hundred sixty a migrants departed friday from the Honduran city [noise]\nSo anyway the news of this caravan has prompted Trump to double down on the threat to cut off aid to Honduras if mass immigration a migration continues\n\nSo there's another thing I give him credit for you know he says hey here's the deal and for and incidentally\nDo you know what soaring you know why this is soaring and why these people are coming because of all of the people who said this is terrible of separating families children from parents\nAnd because they stopped doing that it is increase the number of people that are on the move heading to the usa [noise] you know because\nBecause everyone said this is a terrible thing to do and the and I remember one of the arguments was no you need to do this to discourage authors from pulling the same thing\nI remember when they when this all came up when everybody was complain how do you separate parents from their children\nAnd ... well you can hold the parents longer than you can and children but one of the things that they said was to discourage others from doing this well since we gave in to that not doing that now it hasn't discouraged him it's encouraged them to come here so you got all these people that are coming\nAnd they walk right across Mexico and they had to the U.S border [noise] and ah as a result of that Trump is saying which I agree with is a Honduras or we're going to cut off all the aid to you if you can't get this under control\nAnd so we're not going to have these caravans come into the U.S border and to and we're just going to cut the eight off to you\nAnother thing that he's doing and I say high dam time another thing that he's doing that I say it's about time couldn't be happier about it\nAll right so so finally somebody ... somebody came up hard to believe that tweet hard to believe with thousands of people from uh south of the border walking unimpeded towards our country in a form of large caravans that the Democrats won't approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country\nGreat mid term issue for Republicans that was a Trump's tweet which I think is right you know of course if it's up to the Democrats we wouldn't have borders anyone who wants to come in and would be able to come in if\nIt was up to the Democrats\nI mean that's just how it works with the Democrats we know that goes without saying what else do I have for you I have a just a pile of stuff here I'm going to get a role in here and to start taking some of your phone calls [noise] but I agreed with Trump on that you want to know what makes a sad day in America\nListen to this boys and girls and increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage\nAnd increasing number a burst

all these other people are playing political games they're just playing games that's all it is and that's why they get absolutely and I mean absolutely nothing done as far as I'm concerned that I can and I can't see them getting anything done can you\nKnow nominee recover what outside promote from warfare and they're the ones that are experiencing that's not what the problems are they can identify it they probably have districts that in mind already or at least take us on the right path or identify the problems and then find solutions to those front runner ones on the\nLine and let's acknowledge some problems you're not going to be able to fix I mean it's gonna be hard to fix tell a parent you need to care about education and your kid needs to care about education and you've got to help with homework and go to bed on time\nSome of those problems are ... are impossible to fix you can't fix everything so you end up with mediocre results\n... therein lies the problem I mean you know I just read an article prior to starting to take calls forty percent of births in the United states are out of wedlock you don't think that's going to lead to issues and problems forty percent of them that's crazy\nYeah if you don't have a stable home and write and you're not guarded right you're you're you're going to have a hard time the rest of your life because you got to have those

'cause it can lead to economic and security but\nI like I say I don't know why anyone would votes for the Democrats at this point in time but why would you want to stop all of this kind of stuff\nWell let's go to line three uh Donald you're on the\nAre\nI I'm I'm so confused I grew up in a union hall we've been complaining about this for decades and then someone does it and just because he's not a Democrat they attack and can you help me understand why\n[noise] yeah I can see I can answer your question it doesn't make a damn bit of sense that I mean that's the answer it doesn't make a damn\nBit of sense a because\nLike I say uh you know Tim Ryan he complains about this but he did nothing about it he supported a candidate that would have done nothing about it at what point does Tim Ryan get his own eyes open to say you know watch\nWhen I'm taking a look at the unemployment when I'm taking a look at the stock market when I'm taking a look at the United steelworkers\nYou know maybe this guy does do what he's doing and maybe maybe I Need to pay better attention maybe support the president that let me ask you that question at what point does Sheri Brown in Tim Ryan wise up and say hey this seems to be working for my constituents all of my constituents can you answer that for me\nOr you know I very much I mean the problem we have is is if you align yourself as a Democrat or Republican\nUtah that party line you're not looking at it and I'm not saying all of them do it but you see them trawling party line through doing what's in the interest of the partying and just repeating their mantras\nAs opposed to looking at what's best for my constituents right why would you fight renegotiating what we know it was a bad deal when NAFTA ... he would have been knocked on steroids\nAnd try to fight that right in Trump didn't do that he got rid of that ... these are big things if you look at the economy the economy\nIs soaring because of Trump's very election uh cutting regulations cutting taxes renegotiating\nThese deals\nIn or whatever you even at economists saying I don't know why you want to renegotiate the steel supporting terrorists you don't need to do any of that the economy's going well in Trump's answer was because I promised it in the campaign and I'm going to do it anyway any economists are saying we might have more jobs than we have people well guess what that opens the door to legal immigration\nRight and we are and I think there was a report just released it yesterday or day before that there are more jobs available than those who applied for unemployment\nCorrect so I'm\nI'm at a loss for the last question I'd like to leave with you is maybe a thriller historical back on to it I don't understand moving forward now I Know why the hearing is aligned themselves with the Democrat back in the day\nWhy they're still aligned with the political party and not and why they should have a actually beat her own party and the two parties against each other for the most I'm at a loss I don't understand it\nWell maybe yeah NAFTA all these trade\nAgreements with old town on a union jobs and kill jobs here in this country and yet they still align themselves with the very people were bleeding them dry I don't understand it thank you Mr\nOperative act restraint you know I don't understand it either I have no I Can't give\nYou an explanation why they would do any such thing with it but this is this is a unique precedents he's operating as an American first\nAnd uh because because what you're seeing is a guy who genuinely wants to fix the country what you're saying I think is a guy who hasn't sold his soul up to campaign contributors and lobbyists\nAnd I've never seen a campaign to try to derail some guy like the liberal media has done I've never seen a bias like as a seeing right now\nTo try to stop a guy that seems you know all uh not speculating things are going well\nAnd we can trace exactly where and how they started going well with him and the things that he's done\nAnd GDP Growth and all that you know his argument was guess what I can get a we need to make sure that we have a booming economy because that to help solve a lot of problems as far as debt and deficit Social Security said\nIt also created a demand for labor and it helped wages start to go up which have been stagnant for Thirty years I agree with every single thing that he's doing and it's working\nMeanwhile the Democrats are always for more government more giveaways more taxes\nPenalize business or the wealthy however you can even though you know I thought it was interesting the top fifty percent of people in the United states of America pay Ninety seven percent of the taxes Ninety seven percent of the taxes from those people and that amazing\nI mean that's a really huge\nAnd if you ask me you know the bottom fifty percent they're not doing any of that\nNews radio five Seventy ... from its three fifty one in the afternoon then I'll come back with\nMore\nLast second China has ever sent ... get the job done and don't forget the Eileen than they ... well handle on yet again Cain hunting is money leaving Kane is I guess I can count on there then things haven't seen any huge Fannie if she didn't test me happy land checking panic conveniently located I\nThink they mainly reading can't can't ...\n\nYou don't want to I sit back and think about things that I'm\nKind of lucky is that I have the world's greatest dentist and I'm willing to share with all of you because you know once uh in all seriousness if you can find a good Dennis [laughter] that operates in your patient's best interest to say she convinced me you got to come every six months to a year we catch things early less discomfort less expensive\nHer attitude is patient driven and then and then I and I say this but I like to brag about this she doesn't try to do it all she says okay this person for the patient say gets better root canals so they're better at extraction so that's a sign of a good doctor folks\nAnd you know what a specially with children a lot of people think oh I don't have to wait too long I can wait and I mean there are little that that's not true because children age gap problem and it can complicate things\nWhen they start getting their permanent the ... you know the feeling anything that your child you know you read it and have a positive experience how he's going to be a positive experience that are that it is\nMy favorite Dr Pamela markets story folks I got to tell you this is I I went the first two that I busted I

I I don't believe the bad decisions people make\nShould be the result of society having to pay for them if you don't say for your retirement that's your fault you follow what I'm saying so to a certain extent I find myself kinda agreeing with your first question I mean I hate I hate to admit it but I I I I really find myself agreeing with a guy like a\nAnd I don't I I I don't want to pay our mind it because\nThere's a middle ground because I understand what you're saying culturally you know it seems like it's coming from the left and trust me I have a lot good bye [laughter] I ... it seemed like a lot of really wants to push for legalizing drugs and all that and I think they have for perhaps different intentions are different reasons our motives for doing so\nI'm the reason I agree with it though is because I Believe the the function of\nLaw enforcement really needs to be relegated specifically not too bad decision making ... a person I made me off for exercising their life but instead where it concerns third party victims\nOf for instance I if somebody's doing drugs as a mom doing drugs and you have kids and you're in you're neglecting this kid yeah put them away of course I take action against them because ... against them because there's a third party victim there\nI if somebody gets behind the wheel of course and they're doing drugs don't care if the alcohol or which is legal or marijuana or or cocaine and they and they hurt somebody of course\nTake action against them especially if they're really high on their mind heroin and they're they're driving and they don't encourage victim well take action against too because it's highly likely result that you're going to hurt somebody of course but there's ... when it comes to us prison population\nAnd I said this before and it it it's a fact that we have the highest prison population per capita in the world compared to any other country and that's because a lot of the prison population\nIs there for a non violent drug crimes um and and so it is one of the biggest government programs out there\nAnd let me ask you two questions first of all ... ... people are not in jail for doing drugs people are in jail for selling drugs and and I'm and I'm okay with that image so major misconception it's their jails are full of people doing drugs that is not the case those\n... researched hang I mean let's say something wrong you know you're you're caught with\nCocaine like five grams or last that the twenty five hundred dollar fine in ... by about\nDoing it but it is possible is the key it's usually a fine the people that are in jail for drugs are you there because they were selling drugs I honestly believe in my heart and I would ask you this if somebody's selling heroin and ... I Believe they're killing people I Believe I you know I\nI can remember my wife's into my own kids pay the first time as always free\nDon't ever accept it you know I mean just from school and from as young as ... as young as I can remember her ... ... ... and then my kids' heads\nBut what I'm saying is if you're a drug dealer sell them heroin and fat and all and hooking people I Believe you're asked should go to prison and I believe you are killing people and I believe you're a scourge on society or\nAt least at least that I Believe they are a search on society as well but where we differ is that you know ... if we look at the statistics and the facts especially since the forty or ... or send us an extent the Nixon or perhaps fifty years now one trillion dollars later\nThat the the addiction rate having gone down and there's always drug more drug dealers that will replace those other drug dealers I ... and there's a corollary there's a correlation between what happened during alcohol prohibition when they ... they made it illegal [noise]\nOf course that opened up the black market black market of course does have legal recourse for dispute resolution so they start shooting and killing each other that's why the homicide rate\nQuickly spiked up and then it quickly spiked back down I once prohibition was ended so ... and trust me this is one of those areas where you're you're saying wait if we legalize drugs then of course that that means everybody there's going to be more people doing drugs and we're sending the wrong message but I think that's necessarily the case it's\nWell hold on a second if you if you if you legalize heroin I still wouldn't do heroin alright score but it may and make no mistake I the reason marijuana is being legalized\nIs because government wants to tax it and make money from it make no mistake you know government wants to get into the legalize it because they they were not getting any of that money in any of that tax dollars that that's the real reason\nI don't like that person you know what I might be a criminal and nobody gets any get money\nFrom it right but to a certain extent you know I I guess it I think it it has a right to say for you to work here you can't use drugs and they have the right and and and if it just as they don't hire people who smoke so if you so if this stuff is all legalized and you decided to\nDo it there are consequences to it just as people today can't get jobs because they can't pass a drug test so to a certain extent I kinda agree with you or I but I kinda agree with you with my concern over where is our country in our\nSociety and culture going I mean where is it heading it with a we keep just lowering standards I mean I feel sorry for a lot of kids today because of of ah\nNot having a a permanent family relationship you know I I I said before I never had to grow up we're worrying about where I was going to go for Christmas or where it's going to go you know my mom and dad never cheated on each other's state in the same house might\nPay their bills worked hard and all that kind of stuff and then I never worried about a raffle over my head of the solution\nRight yeah because when it comes to drug addicts\nBut you know watch the they're they're they're and they're going to be there why I Want you to talk a little bit about that pet seriously and\nWhat you know what Ron it it it is a big news a day in our industry about what's going on and it is a real real shame\nUm in fact I Am sitting in a parking lot right now talking to you on my way to our customers house of theirs um that has a real tough luck story right and I called them and said I'm coming out to visit you I Want to see what I can do for you\nAnd you know um I I've known that this was coming because you hear things in our industry or from the vendors you know they're they're on a cash basis they can't pay their bills so they jump from one company that\nThey owe money to they jumped to another company to buy their products windows and what have you um and and they play that shell game\nBut I think I think I'm wrong that is taking thousands of dollars from people and not in a somewhat knowing it and not delivering any of the goods\nI mean that's all\nYou know in the worst thing about this was is that they were caught they he knew he was going out of business he was calling customers saying look if you go ahead and pay up front I'll take ten percent off and people were doing it\nDave I Want you to hold that break 'cause I Want to talk about just sit tight for [laughter] see that's what ... that's what bothers me but pat the ... a guarantee in all in in down payments are only as good as a how solid that company is to begin with right that's the foundation\nOf course there there's no question about it um and and you know it's not the only you know I there there are good companies out there there's no question about it but you you don't know who those bad companies are you know I just hear through the grapevine\nWell I Want you to pause for a second on that there are ... you know your company is a good company and you know what makes it a good company your family would you not agree with that from the very standard\nThat it operates with hold that please stay with stuff that okay you know when you're not agree that\nThrough um you know I've been in this business for thirty six thirty seven years now Ron and and I'm not going anywhere you know my dad may may retire sometime I may retire sometime but my son my daughter are going to continue on but you know ... like it's like anything else\nUm you have to you have to know and trust who you're dealing with\n[noise] and ... and it's so vitally important decision you make when when you make it I I just want you to listen to what pets telling you you know because I'm I feel bad for these people and you're going to meet with some of these folks and path to see what you guys can do it when the

and I just heard uh on the news that he wants all of our department to cut out the way I Believe in that but here we're giving Honduras sixty five million\nDollars [laughter] they have nothing they

you that long time ago Iran I look in the paper it makes me sick\nHow many of these people having babies and I would say three quarters of these children and their loss before they even start\nRight All right then you don't get below the heart you know once you have children I think\nIt's bigger than your your life there so that there's other people and sometimes you make sacrifices and you know

secretary of state Pompeo arrived\nIn Saudi Arabia's capital that nation transfer to a hundred million dollars to the U. S. rule was cold stabilization projects in Syria the Saudis agreed to provide the funds in August but the timing is raising questions because of allegations that the Saudis killed journalist ... in Turkey that's what Pompeo went to ... to talk about\nWhen did you come home and feel like I really did a good job today and\nBe like hey so I haven't had to [laughter]\nCome to work at an outlet [laughter]\nI Would someday I'll be able to go home and experience that but yeah\nYeah and so like when you asked that question you asked that question first and then you say when was the day where you really didn't feel like you felt you were up against it and you could have done a better job what would you have done different or what could have you done different or what could have your management team that different\nWe're looking for those kinds of answers because the employees and Daryl in her case has to be a part of the solution when she has a problem or she has a question she calls me and I pick up the phone and we work it out together\nNow Darryl more beer center are and what what exactly do you do I know certify the nurse officer does know what do you do for ...\nWell my role is to actually streamline the process or the woman that comes into the imaging center I'm has her mammogram done and if we do see that there is something that we need more imaging\nWe're seeing something that could be a possible cancer then that's when I come into play I make sure that we get that patient\nI'm to the next level we streamline that process we advocate advocate for the patient educate the patient and move them down the line and really um give them the best care possible times things get lost in the shuffle and the navigation keeps it going\nWell let's talk October is breast cancer awareness month and a ... are we making progress I think we are you know are we over the fear someone would say oh it's going to hurt or it's going to be uncomfortable or we beyond that do you think\nOh I think we are really making strides we have done that technology and just everything I'm about health care for women\nUh we're really advocating for education are um equipment is is just I'm Better than ever but I think women are aware of um the need for the mammograms and I don't think it's so it is fearful but we shouldn't be\nThough it's just a test ... and ... if we catch this early it's very curable suits and we can fix it as opposed\nTo waiting it is the technology makes it easier to find\nHow often should a woman have a mammogram is that a yearly thing or what\nWell we like to say that women start mammograms at the age forty and yearly may have changed some recommendations but we we feel that aged forty is the time to start and I'm actually a women in their fifties that is when I'm\n... you really see an increase in breast cancer\nSo it ... to ... so when you're on fifty you start to see more cases of it\nAs it goes on you know what you as you were talking I was thinking about just colonoscopy so used to say started getting him at fifty and now they're starting to lower that age down to more closer to forty to try to catch that earlier because we can solve problems with you know with that as well so the same thing happens when it comes to\nA breast cancer and mammogram so that kind of stuff is uh you wouldn't talk a little bit about the technology for just a second at the imaging center like when you go in a can people call directly to have this done do you have to go through your family ... process work for a yearly mammogram\nWell a screening mammogram um we do like a patient to have a prescription for Dr their family to under family doctor but they could walk right in with that and we'll take care of them right away mhm come in for that um it's best to have a position\nI'm On board so that if we do need to do additional imaging that decision to refer to\nWrite it could be your family doctor rapid ... that that would that would send you there\nAnd so then so then your role which I think it's a really good role I mean if everything comes out fine then you know you you have no concerns or whatever people can get on with their life you come into if there's there if there becomes a another test that's needed or something of concern correct\nRight right at the beginning\nIn and to what to talk to the ... should about what a you know what the concern is er what's next because that's a fearful stuff yes\nYeah we coming right at the beginning um we explain to them what we're seeing we try to keep them calm we tell them we're we're going to do extra images that would be an mammography and if they need an ultrasound done we say well we might have to take a a different type of exam\nMove them right on to that ultra sound and if we need to do a biopsy the same day we do at the same day we like everybody to have everything on the same day if ...\nYou don't want to I like about that is still wait to can just drive you crazy you know what I'm saying that the huge difference maker right there so if you say so you try to soak it we're going to go to this process next and you then you would explain it as to why that is\nThat we have a little conference room we bring the family in there if there are there not we just talk with the woman Heller what we need to have done um I have to say that nobody wants to wait till the next day we're going to have it done immediately\nI'm like that and my doctor my hypochondriac I think I'm dying any day now but anyway you know I'm Glad to see that happen I mean I really think that that she when she talks about the south which way that's the south which way in other words you're not there said okay you got to go to the next level or the next level it's too far down and go to the right ... well why do I need to do this\nThat that is horrible to to do for it to somebody in that position and that you got to find your role very rewarding\nI Do I really do\nI mean because I think that that's that is a a difference maker are we seeing people women pay attention in October I mean everybody knows it's breast cancer awareness month we're seeing the numbers go up are we not just for regular imaging is what I'm saying I have been\nSo busy we are or things like that covered like you know of ... with calling U.S companies that's part of preventative care that's fully covered it up to a veteran insurance crushes at the same thing with mammograms preventative sprinting stuff\nScreening mammograms is yes and I think the diagnostics are too but if you have something that needs further imaging um my mayor that isn't considered I'm part of screening\nWhat how do you interface you are you mentioned about with the patient well how do you interface than with the physician\nWell we are I'm collaborating with physicians at all times ... um we have reference cards and all of our dogs and we like to um\nYou know we like to do things just the way they want us to many of them now they trust us we just go right along and go from one exam to the next um some if something needs done they are in total agreement but we still want to follow their preference\nMhm do you have to talk like you know whenever you hear if if you say well we want to further explore this kind of stuff about it I guess or is it a more frightening word than cancer for somebody\nDo you have to talk a little bit about the really how curable issues or the survival rate that it is or that we caught this early and that kinda stuff I mean\nWhat you mean to yes absolutely we\nJust I'm positive with every patient mhm you know you just have to say we've got this um caught it early American and get you to the right position um we have a team of surgeons that lock\nA space ... though that our patients could get in to see them if not the next day with in that week\nAnd I think that's very important and people don't realize they don't want to you know they they really want to talk to to another a doctorate\nSo you're like you're you're almost the I Want to say even though you worked for software would you're kind of like the patient representative through this process\nWill to to a certain extent to say okay here's what we're going to do next and here's why we're going to do that and here's you know what I mean you're kind of you you're kind of like you're the best friend of the person at the time I Would think you know just because of somebody having to know how like you have at the time advocate for the for\nBecause for the patient\nSo no let's talk a little bit of a ... year career when you got hired I mean to\nYou this this is something new\nYou know I've I've never really heard of this and it makes sense to me that self which would be charting you know ... or something like this which I think is a good idea but this was something new for you guys as well so it's\nYeah I think well I Know that nurse navigators have been around for a while but the oncology nurse navigator\nI'm really came in on the scene in the nineties and this was just a really exciting role for me because I had been in oncology in my early years and it was just I'm just really good way to get back in and do really good things for\nWomen love it there that's right [laughter] right\nBut but you know why that is it's the satisfaction I think to do that you get from being able to be there when everything is fine let's put it that way let's start with that and the satisfaction you get there to say well we got to get some other images and\nAnd passed away and I was a brand new nurse when my mother went through this and no one was there to help her and she was actually ashamed of having breast cancer and fearful of it and my goal as a surgical nurse was to make those those patients comfortable when they were coming into had such a\nUm what they felt was a horrific\nProcedure and chemotherapy and and make my mother could use their little support right I'll support what's gonna happen to me next but most of the people but it didn't exist at the time not exist so being able to transform the care of a woman\nIs my mission as well as ... as well as the entire imaging center you know we have all those radiology techs that have been doing the immigrants for years and years they have countless hours that experience\nWe want to transform the way we care for women and I think we have a good start we were growing everyday at south within me always looking for a new way and I think we have a great START I think that in based on our customer satisfaction are patients love what we're doing\nFor them so we can always improves and and you know our our fold that thought I'd come right back in a minute news radio five Seventy ...

our microphones I could if I tell you this which I find the attitudes of these people refreshing enjoy Kearns seeing that certified nurse officer right to\nDo you have nursing oh jarring achieve do I have to call your chief during the you\nKnow a kind of goes chief nursing officer and to Daryl more BSN are in South towards health nurse navigator prior them coming on I have never heard and I've been around a long time I have never heard of a nurse navigator\nBut you know it when she was talking about that position I to me I think for that makes a world a sense in any health facility but no one does but it just makes so much sense to me\nBecause of you want to talk about a time that you're most vulnerable it's in those things when you don't know what's going on you think everybody's talking over your head and nobody's helping you along at ... and you've been in regular hospitals long enough to know what I'm Talking about and then they come up with this idea\nOf what a refreshing idea that is I mean I it's just it's just absolutely wonderful do we need to I mean there shouldn't be um I don't want any of you to fear\nOr getting a check with a mammogram we talk often about women but men get breast cancer too don't they could talk a little bit about that do we have a I mean because you want to talk about an awkward situation there would be one to write\nThe street and then same way that we treat women they get mammograms and if they need to have a biopsy we do the same thing that we would do for anyone to get them to the biopsy as soon as possible at the same day we get him to get them to a surgeon and they need to have it removed that many but we we have seen\nBut it does happen and you feel a little bit of a stranger awkward because it's so much so often associated with it as a female thing and it's not always a female thing now what I Want people to do and what what I Want people to know\nHere is what you need to do or what you need to do a schedule your mammogram today that the south would Center for breast health now that's located inside south towards imaging\nAnd this is really easy to find its Seventy six twenty three market street in boardman and they offer convenient early morning evening and Saturday hours\nTo schedule your mammogram all you do is called three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred and three three zero nine six five fifty one hundred so schedule your mammogram this is\n... ... when the when these folks come on here\nAnd you know I'm sitting with a lot of knowledge sitting in his room when these folks come on here they are in essence saying\nIt's October it's breast cancer awareness certainly if you're forty years or older and you didn't get a mammogram this year you should be getting one\nTo make sure that you don't have this problem\nAnd if you do the sooner you get it the better your odds of living are is that a fair statement to make a living I mean that's really what it's all about\nSo I I mean these people is to a like a public service a labor of love on doing something like that and when they say hey this is how easy we make this to do to get this thing will take advantage of its schedule your mammogram today the southward Center for breast health\nWill get inside south woods imaging Seventy six twenty three market street and boardman\nThat's right before the car dealerships over there on market street you'll see the imaging center either they offer convenient early morning evening and I really like the Saturday hours to
