really going to be\nAbsolutely fascinating Mike on a cell phone news radio find Seventy nobody can be done three eleven in the afternoon run for till seven o'clock tonight Holly Richie joins me at six hello\nHey Ron this is going to make it really a lovely I think so too but you can't let them come you can now that would be even worse so what I think Trump should do is get in front of the camera and the night and the dress dress\nAmerican public but he's also addressing the Mexican president and telling them ex president you disperse that crowd right now if you don't\nWe will with our military home down there because you are complicit in a Beijing into\nOur sovereign nation\nRight but let me ask you this let me ask this question how do you suspect they divert ah how didn't let's let's move ... just start with Mexico's not going to do any of that they're just going to continue coming this way\nWhat do you do in that crowd is a crowd that size and growing comes to the U.S border now and now in our reality\nJust first before they get here there are why dwell on aren't working on her miles away this or something now we know what their intent is\nWell how do you disperse them now\nYou send in our military and they Mexico because Mexico right now is complicit in\nBeijing there is just the new people they're letting them come through here they are country you are as knowing that\nThey plan on reaching our borders so they are complicit and that's an act of war ride I don't care how you it's an act of war\nSo you said and US military should basically invade Mexico and the pursuit of this is your idea\nWhat are they going to throw a so that is\nWell now I'm just I'm just putting out your idea and I don't think most people would agree with that that the U.S military shuts or simply go into Mexico\nI don't know what else you're going to do or what your solution was therein lies the problem is when they come from the border among friends they're\nGoing to look at all these people and the children crying in the women crying and oh God and Trump did all of this\nWell their habits All right thank you Mike I mean\nUh in us a key question what's uh what is the solution and you want my end up the answer I don't\nKnow I I Do not know [laughter] uh this is where the president and the military and mine's earn their money\nI mean this anyone who calls me says well about shooting that's just not going to happen All right so let's just eliminate that I mean I'm not even\nInterested in taking calls for military is not going to open up live fire and just start killing a bunch of people men women and children so that I mean that's just a waste of time that's gonna happen I don't think you're going to see a country to Mike's thoughts the U.S military invade Mexico to disperse them before they get to the border\n\nSo or ... to ... it's tough Bob on a cell phone run although hear news radio five Seventy nobody can be an hello\nHi how are you ah I'm taking covered sir I'm In my bunker\nOkay well you know what I don't think you're going to have to do that\nBut uh anyways\nThere really is no good solution and Trump is really in a no win situation right there there there is no way\nThat the United states or Trump presidency in their strategy can come out on top with something like this\nUm we've already seen that the other side of the aisle\nDoesn't matter if we are at zero unemployment and we're at six percent or ... or whatever they will do what ever they need to do to regain their footing or their leverage their power\nExplain a writer right ... explained to me I I like the things that you said they will do what they have to do to regain their power but it was also take a look at some of the data that shows that the blue wave is very much alive\nIn it too and it's a good the they claimed the Democrats will take over Congress now based on everything that you've said prior to that why would anyone vote\nFor this so called blue wave to try to stop Trump based on everything you just said\nWell on there is some historical data that\nI'll forget as you don't want to claim that happens I don't care I don't care what usually happens in the mid term stinks ago unreal things are going really well why would they want to ... why would you want to change any of that I mean things are going really well now\nThinking it's their way of thinking okay there's there we don't have a rational\nThat they don't have a rational argument it's just all day thing it's like taking an insane person okay they do something about them it's not wrong to them it's not and say\nTo them it's rational you will never change their way of thinking that that makes sense\nOr frankly it to be blunt with you\nAre voting for people will try to derail Trump's agenda doesn't make a damn business sense to me I mean I I guess I get people to just think that that he Trump but I mean if you take a look at\nHow things are going things seemed to be going really well I mean I think very well so I don't agree with that I make no it doesn't make any sense why anyone would vote against sat on the last uh unless they're socialist or the or they're afraid to a lesser socialist\nNow that the American people traditionally once you have one side or the other way it's a Republican and your minister Asian or Democrat and the administration and you have that same party in control in the house and Senate they say we can't let them have too much control\nWhat has happened with our country over the last hundred years mhm they you know what we have a Republican in the in the White House he's doing good everything's fine on the economy trying to protect us and everything but we can't really let them have all the\nYeah but then you just stall everything I mean I I I I I I make no mistake I'm genuinely perplexed on why anybody would votes to stole what's going on because I mean major things are happening here but the ... the attitude towards the military the attitudes towards the police\nThe attitude towards a renegotiating lousy deals the economy everything seems to be going in the in the right direction why you would say man I got to stop this guy\nHonestly doesn't make a damn bit of sense to me but I agree with your initial statement I mean there is a mess waiting at the border in ...\n... if if Trump gets physical and aggressive to stop seven to fourteen thousand people you will have the bleeding hearts\nWhich already don't believe in borders and ice and all that kinda stuff screaming how horrible it says men women and children look what he's doing\nWe are going to have a mess it's not these people are not coming like they did a from Cambodia\nOr from the Holocaust or from the Balkans or or from Rwanda\nYou know those things are not happening here they just don't like their government their government is so corrupt okay that it does not work for the people that only works for the lead and that's what happens

border what do you do with all these people come in\nWell first of all you know and he goes on how you looking at it I have a question for you and I I'm not going to comment on your answer I just want to know\nWhile I'm looking for the answer though I thought maybe you had ... I'll\nGive you the answer I'll give you the answer that first of All right all you want a natural is like the President Trump said he is\nIt depends how you wanted to find a nationalist if if you're asking me do I believe in America first to do I believe in the United states of America do I support the home team absolutely one hundred percent I Am not a global list\nI don't believe that we should sacrifice our lifestyle and their jobs to build up the rest of the world at our expenses at our expense so I Am for team America now if that makes you a nationalist or if that makes you pro American or whatever term you want to use\nThat why would fall into that category I Am not in the mentality of the global lists that are willing to sacrifice a lot of the things that we enjoy in America to try to build up the rest of the world's a so now I Believe in America first\nWell don't you ... ... if you if\nYou look up as socialism nationalism and fascism you know they owned that you can do is just go out on the borders on shooting\nWell I ... I don't I don't I don't think that's gonna happen\nWell actually that you never know they could make it but if you want to national is and you believe what scholars some of your callers are saying they're not going to have you had no choice you've paid your self talk on\nSo I don't know about that I don't you believe in America first\nAre you asking you asked me what to do I'm asking you another question now well you you ... on there and starts unity\nYou led me to the to the next question do you believe in America first I mean as an American do you believe you do you put your country first\nListen you know what I was looking at your menu that we ... we took almost on a tight American\nThan someone forget our picture together although it was a very special moment I might add a ... if\n... if you'd asked\nMe do I believe with America\nNo do you believe in America for that question there's something wrong or right\nThat is so does that make you a nationalist I don't think so I think it makes you whenever you want to use I don't\nBelieve in ... I don't believe that as young as ... and I was I don't know if there was like on a leave of arthritis sports I I Can't stand that there was like well you got an end to end up on that which\nAre alright what about ... what about patriotism there's an is among the end of that\nWell the thing about it is people are still in that you know got to pay ... a yet to a point to them and then you had chicken pox that will talk about that I don't agree with you but I just want to know you know that's a natural is do they stand on the border and it should be\nOr what do you think we should do you have a nice day well what do you think we should do me personally yes\nWe'll see what I'm saying is\nThe problem right now is you're trying to close the barn door right\nAfter the livestock as well\nNow we are acting more and more like a third world country every day we we bomb in each other's terrorism here you know what I'm saying so that was drawn those people there that if you sit down and have honest conversation with you know and say listen you cannot come across the border\nIllegally and they they come across right they won't let them watch what you get a sign of who they are or who I say they are\nYou can't let that we disappear and there's not just on the president is not just on a border patrol all the people that are firing people it doesn't have a job here they'll be you know I'm so tired of people saying they already get on a do we get that rate in that area\nBut hang on it but I Want you to hang on a second you're not going to be able to just stand out and say hey I Want to talk to all you people also have another fourteen thousand I think we're going to bring them in right\nProcessing the bottom line it\nAnd then what are you doing would it have a job state\nAnd then what do you do after you process them because they're then they're all going to demand their day in court and then they're going to disappear so that you don't have\nThat problem it disappeared about good a job right\nNow they just disappear because they never show up for their court date had\nHappy happy they had to have a place to stay well why don't we let people do hire them they are the rich will sell to him why we let them off well\nLet's see you got to deal with the immediate problem based on what you're saying is what they say they come in they disappear into the country and who knows where they go or what they're doing what they got into the country and the jobs\nThat might feed them well do you think that we should not let him into the country that you've got to stop 'em before they come into the country\nKnow either do I and I think there's a lot of that going on I mean I I\nI I thought gee you know made a good point I mean I've been waiting for a long time for somebody to seriously put America First stop being a global is take a look good contracts that really screwed are people in our country and renegotiate them so at least they're fair to America\nI've been waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and I finally got somebody doing that I've been waiting for somebody\nThat really understood economics to know that the answer is redistribution of wealth or higher taxes are punishing business to get the economy rolling a guy that was made fun of by ... said he's basically daydreaming if he thinks he can get the four or five percent GDP\nUh I've been waiting for this for a long time somebody will fulfill their campaign promises promises that I agreed with that is actually doing something that seems to have the country on the right track both economically uh in in many other ways as well I mean we've got to a point where we have more job openings and we have\nUnemployed people but I mean that's an amazing turn around and you got Obama trying to take credit for that that's laughable to me and a half\nAgo I mean I I couldn't believe that when I heard that on the other day\nYeah I mean it's just because you can directly traces to Trump's very election you can trace it to cutting regulations you can trace it to lowering corporate taxes getting rid of a lot of the stuff all bottle putting away his change the whole outlook you know a bottle pretty well\nSaid manufacturing is dead get over its Trump has reignited manufacturing and he wants to take credit for that so unbelievable will be back after this stage of [noise]

right\nI mean there's no way we're all going to happen you got your we have about a week until they get to the border so that I mean the only rational and realistic thing I can think of it are my head is\nFrom the government is going to have mobilized\nOffend the border it might defend the border I'm saying look there in their looks scary and when they come across that thousand men women and children I'm a crock pot going to be like a war\nIt's going to be coming or crop that we're going to have for the rest of the times says it's All right thank you Nineteen\nSeventy times it's coming along ... go to their brothers dot com they use radio five seven doubled\nDown\nThe news\nI'm Scott Goldberg investigators believe there is a common thread between the explosive devices send you a number of high profile political figures\nFavor of border security but not a wall in essence what he's saying is I'm In favor of border security as long as we don't do anything to secure the border\nI mean it's insanity you simply have to stop this we can't go on having such a large percentage of our population here illegally and so I I Would advocate the use of the military to stop this to this doesn't become an incentive for future action is just like\nThis All right so so you just bring a bunch of the military down there to to do what just their residence\nHowever they can seal the border I don't know you know it's it's almost impossible that's why the wall\nIs such an important thing because you know we don't have that many we don't have enough people to put over a couple of thousand miles of border and so the wall would reduce the need for the wall and other types of security devices would reduce the need for manpower\nAnd all these people who fight against the wall there are really making this problem a continuing problem and and and then who's our local congressman he's a guy who doesn't believe in the wall and uh he should be\nA you know and she be asked about that I think you I don't know how you're going to do it I think maybe I don't know whether he has the right\nTo declare martial law or to declare a national emergency in in certain parts of the country I'm not sure I'm not a legal expert but I think something of an extraordinary measure has to be taken in order to stop\nThis new usually to reduce the number of people who make it into the country\nDo you think that this is an organized events\nAbsolutely you know I sent you a a document someone else sent me about how can these people you know the human body could not travel the thousands of miles that they say these people are traveling without the need for clothing and restrooms\nAnd food and water and health care\nI mean it's an ... it's a joke to think that these people are doing this for some type of organization and to have that many people traveling a couple of thousand miles we take a lot of money in a lot of logistical planning and support I mean you've got to move the food to where these people are you have to make arrangements for somebody to be somewhere to feed him you have to be\nKind of naive to think it's not organized it's organized\nAnd it's it is people there are people you know it gets back to the point about the nationalist versus the global is you know George Soros he's a target because he's a global is he doesn't believe in a nation state they don't believe in religion either that's why I was a Catholic I tell them like fellow Catholics not to be such\nA so we so concerned about social justice and people like George Soros because he would do away with the Catholic Church if he could in addition to doing away with nations then that the structure of a nation has served the structure of the nation the United states has served the world well\nIf not for the United states in World War two a lot of people in Europe would still be living under Nazi is and if not for the United states a lot of people would be the still living under communism in Eastern Europe so the nation states serves while you have to have some order for people to exist some set\nSome structure and some rules by which people live and we have a very successful nation states United States of America\nDo you think that if this was an organized events or by someone what is the goal I mean what is their goal is these people approached U.S born to make Trump look bad what's the well above\n... pen said that he was told by the president of Honduras or whatever the title of the leader of\nIs that the Venezuelans were a supporting this you know um\nThat's my drove down there and ...

just want to do whatever they can do damage to us\nYou don't want to we don't want to have a nation we don't want to you know is one thing to have people come here and to assimilate and to become a

we back country\nThese spots around the world that's where these people come from why don't we instead of giving these people foreign aid to export their people why don't we make sure that before we give them foreign aid they take care of their own people [noise]\nWell I think that uh I think there should always be strings attached foreign aid as a matter of fact I'm trying to just drop it is that is we're going to cut it based on you guys not a not a are sending all these people both to for for example\nA Honduras is in a big ally of ours and we we send them billions every year and they're sending their people up here are our biggest problem wrong with the reason these people are coming here we're having overpopulation problem in the world and it is a global problem\nBy America First garbage that you're pushing\nIs part of the problem because we can't ignore the rest of the world we there are a major problem in this world that we all have to deal with and by by having going and burying our heads in the than we are only making it worse [laughter]\nI'm not saying you bury your head and sand but you always have to operate with America First we are Americans and I I ... in ... and everything and anything you negotiate should have America's Best interest at heart yeah that's\nRight but the isolationism the proper pushing is dangerous it gave it that kind of\nPushing pushing isolationist somebody saying hey China needs our marketplace more than ... east finally saying look the latest with China I mean obviously renegotiated NAFTA\nAnd in Canada and Mexico went along with it made a fair agreement for the United states now he's saying that China this isn't isolationism he's saying you need are ... he knows that they need our marketplace and that they'll come to the table\nA country that doesn't respect our patent laws is a communist country and he's going to get them in line so that they stop screwing the United states of America that is not isolationism that's negotiating deals that are in the best interest of your country after they've been screwed for years\nAbout isolationism but\nWe came back in these spots around the world\nYou know what this is what we were you doing that law before Trump and meddling in the middle east and there are elections in in putting people in and taking them out and we made a lot of major mistakes certainly in the middle east I totally agree with that and that is the fault of Democrats and Republicans vote yes\nRight I don't think I don't see Trump doing that too much right now I see Trump dealing with ISIS which really you don't hear much talk about terrorism and many ISIS terrorists or problems that have taken place but he's not of isolation is\nHe basically has negotiating fair trade deals and I don't I think that's long overdue and I don't think it's up to us and I also like when he said to Honduras you keep sending all these people eat more cut your foreign aid and All right I mean I don't\nBecome a contractor dishing out to these people\nI Know they got to go to the bathroom they gotta eat they gotta have water they have all these trucks following along somebody's paying for all of this and somebody orchestrated all of this\nSomebody must have a a\nYou know they got somebody who got an agenda here\nYes it sure looks that way to me\nThank you for your call I appreciate it

Steve on a cell phone hello\nHi Ron Steve hey I'm\nGoing out shopping I haven't heard anybody talk about the last few days especially about this a German thing by the time they're projected to get to the border it shouldn't be wintertime\nAnd I don't think these people are actually going to be with us for biology which is out in the military at the border you not want them crotch and just sit there and camp out how many you know that it's going to turn into a humanitarian situation from the people out in a while\nI think the weather is a little bit more mild down there than it is\nBut I drove through there at night you maybe seven just before Christmas Time it was cold spell a lover of why shouldn't\nYeah but you have to but that's rare that's\nMore rare than normal I mean they're not protected to get in to the border\nSo Bob first or second week of January ... at the wintertime in North America and if you all been actors correct most of the north American is going to get here at our share so you're saying I don't think anybody's actually thought about it because I Know I haven't heard it on radio\nYeah yeah I must admit that's the first time I've heard anyone say something like that but I thank\nYou for saying it pretty fascinated to Alex ... on a cell phone news radio five Seventy ... can be going hello\nHey Ron it the thing that kills me is this group of seven thousand people coming here they're flying hunter and flags and Guatemalan slacks and hiking and saying or won't stop to really get to our mission there they're not even saying we want to be Americans all we want to do is live the American dream and get here\nI mean they don't even want to be American they just want to come here and suck up the system and it drives me absolutely insane they're not even playing the game right right\nThat's what kills me it's it's like ... what are you going to do when you get here I mean it it blows my mind and and the other thing that um I Want to bring up is ... and I think\nIt was somebody was talking about it on Limbaugh together day you can only claim asylum in our country bordering yours by United Nation lives so these people\nReally can't even claim asylum in our country they can only hire asylum in Mexico so that's what I don't I I really don't get I I mean I'd have to look up a little bit more into that but um it makes sense you can't hike across the entire world and say now I can claim asylum in your country because it's the ...\n[noise] um [noise]\n\nIt is I mean it's it's growing as they're coming this way okay say earlier today at all and\nAnd I just don't know what what is going to happen that day that ten thousand or twelve thousand navy by the time they actually show up and they're right on the border I mean we're not even I mean are we going to be able to put enough troops National Guard or anything on the border\nI really I don't ...\nI don't know that I mean that is the key question what is going to be the strategy to deal with that many people at one it's overwhelming at one time I'm I'm with you I mean that is really\nRight now we're going to have to have a mobile wall just to\nFind out and figure out where they're going to probably what'll happen is right when they get close enough to the border that's when the buses trains and everything that way they can really get moving\nBut if you're a Democrat right now you've got to be for more ISIS for more taxes or more abortions for more taxes or less freedom for less defense or less protection I Can't think of a single solitary thing that they stand for that\nBetter is our country in any way shape or form oh yeah on the health care on there too if you want to pay a seven thousand dollars in your ... and have basically\nNo health insurance but on a piece of paper it blows my mind if you are voting Democrat in this election absolutely blows my mind\nEven if even if the Democrats are uh you know starting this caravan which there's not a reporter that behind her and present even set themselves that um it was organized by a group of leftist but anyway even if even if they come to the border you really think that's going to change anybody's mind\nPolitics the way it is right now you're either so far left her so far right nothing's going to change your mind\nAll right well stated thank you for your call out on a cell phone news radio five

paper and the government dictator on what you're going to make work you're going to do\nAnd everything else\nWhat now what what motivates in individual\nIndividual is motivated by the reward say yet what motivates somebody to dedicate ten years of their life in medical school obviously they have a calling to be a doctor take care of people but when they're done they'll make a good living and they should make a good living because they sacrifice to get there\nWhat motivates somebody to say I'm going to take out of a second mortgage on my house and risk everything and open up my own business and if I succeed\nAre good if I say all I could lose everything what motivates them the hope of being successful and making a a a better living in the there than they are making now and have some degree of independence\nThat's what motivates people for for capitalism but the but there are a growing segment of our society who\nThinks those people should be punished that we should take from them and give it to this guy over here wants to sit on a damn front porch all day\nExactly wrong in that great one hundred percent with you but there's a higher driving force somewhere that saying no matter
