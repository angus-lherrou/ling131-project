in record it to concerts in London in July\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce or in Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann in Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from\nBut some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of a war with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel a and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday miss week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena or to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back the man that's in the middle of all of\nThis and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow view getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that don't understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in the scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime\nIn ... and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact the food does have a network of of their own deep state operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did versus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about\nElection interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead\nAt the DNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is a first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think my first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on\nYou and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged\nRight ... ... well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah it's basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been\nA source for the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some recourse for you well\nI've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time basically yeah and you know going back many years again\nAnd we had talked about how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spend total\nOver the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of document production etcetera\nRight now that's a whole different level when you went before a mall or what was that like you know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just\nBecause in general they have been a less leaky in terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't\nRemember that night but I Will I keep an eye back at all absolutely not and\nYou haven't you know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time he got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen\nAt all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of freedom well you know\nJose Ramirez finished the series all poor eleventh [noise]\nAnd the ...\nThere's ball for low in a way [noise]\nKnown as the born to start dying [noise]\nEleven [noise]\nThat'll bring up Josh Donaldson used grounded up ... you forget\nThough [noise] serious here for him and obviously brought up here and\nBe making it back to what he said his struggle\nDonaldson old for done in the series\nThe pitch outside if you look at the end the ... middle of the order\nJose Ramirez was old for eleven Edwin ... was one for ten and Josh Donaldson Oprah ten\nExcept Ramirez on a ground up\nThat pitch in their strike [noise]\nOne ball one strike\nFor a gallon John ...

we don't execute the double play and then from there you know you if you have to start playing the infield in because one more runs too much and then that leads to crooked number\n... here in the back

to give some analysis and we're also All right I Want you to get some analysis from a national level at a local level is along question are are you ready for it locally if you look at it okay and this is or the guy was six\nToo many locally if you look at it two thirds of General Motors has closed down locally because to the other ... one third is open to a therapist close and there's and the and it's uncertain what the future holds for General Motors sports town\nUh so I didn't tell you well hang on a science are north side hospital is shut down\nA so a lot of what's going on locally isn't that great however we have T. J. ex opening up however those jobs don't pay what General Motors pace or what North side uh had paid so this guy is asking me\nAsk John what he thinks about it when you take a look locally you see a lot of help wanted signs but it's twelve or Thirteen dollars an hour what's going on locally in contrast that to what's going on nationally with\nA historically low unemployment since Nineteen sixty I alright there's the question I asked him now I'll sit back and listen okay so that is always one other thing where I and I told him well John goes to Florida and he gets out you know and\nNot only that how does your garbage and conferences all over the country he's in\nTexas right on tennis in South Carolina it is gangbusters on their their only complaint is we can't find enough quality health brown here Youngstown, Ohio is\nOne of the greatest things instead of ... the people\nYou know you you look at the ... of the road and the the powerful leadership here I'm Sorry I'm just alley here in the valleys and then you know it was ...\nAnd they give so much back to the community in in in the in the bread and butter or green or people like small businesses like Ron bourbon John Arnold in my even my competitors et cetera you know we're providing jobs and are great people is a great base of people here problem is\nThat's all we have left the other the other I Want to say the catalyst that thing worked with everything we're missing is that's see that's the business that that kind of puts everything else like a BMW manufacturing plant like a\nYou know X Y Z pulling the lever for twenty five bucks an hour right as warlords touted yeah here me out and unfortunately this area\nIs not attracted those folks and now it's caught up to us\nOr you know Youngstown State is obviously a great employer south woods but it's getting less and less and less so you know if you're an investor from an advanced that's investor's standpoint I can tell you I'm biased flee\nI've been to Austin I've been to Houston I've been to Chicago it's it's a crazy runaway freight train when it comes to the economy and a good way\nYoungstown, Ohio has not representative of the markets and and how the economy's doing it's just not and I and I and that it comes down to the leadership and are you know political leadership that's been telling us down for forty years and that's why I'm a strong a proponent of the new blood coming in like Rob changing it yeah\nSo it's not in and listen I'm not so biased to where if there wasn't a great Democrat out there a strong Democrat is willing to do things right and and get businesses coming flowing innocent of flowing out they will get my vote so it's it's an unbiased electric here and the fact that\nWhat we need to change our low ... or so when you go out\nAnd when you're talking when you go out and you see all of this taking place\nNot not to say that we don't have our assets obviously TJ ex warehouse wanted to be in large town and that could attract other warehouses we shall see as time because we have Macy's we have to ...\nOther than the ... the transportation but you know we have great crossroads between Chicago New York ... Cincinnati I can go on and on and on his for Cleveland it's this or square footage\nIs ridiculously cheap here\nThat he looked at some of our our warehouse yards and and our yards out there that are just ... you know sitting there growing weeds if you're if you're a huge corporation out there and you can get two and a half dollars at three ... three hundred square foot versus ... square foot for the same thing and you can in obviously are folks here are willing to accept while the Fifteen bucks an hour\nAnd you can live decent here for that uh which is not always a good thing there's a there's a lot to be said there I don't know why we don't have a business development board like I've sat on I've sat on a business development board in Palm Beach and I've seen what they do when it takes there's a constant business going on to get other businesses\nBut it said do you agree it's easier for Florida in the places where people want to retire to for weather purposes it's a lot easier for a lot of those places than it might be coming bounces off\nYou know number of things so I I Want to do a ... you know I'm going to get in the national stuff with them just stay tuned locally or a political corruption strong union mentality um\nLot of issues the organized crime less of an issue these days but you know political corruption continues a so so um other leaders right so\nThat is\nHard to overcome and then when you talk about Palm Beach will they got the weather and none of them over there and\nLet me tell you something I mean at this ... respectively [noise] we've had a challenge in Palm Beach attracting\nA fluent manufacturing businesses okay so too hot or what [noise] nope no the ... this was a horrible thing to say the town down there is is lean the town down there's lean what what we lack here as far as like tropical trees and whether and beautiful places to go\nWe gain in human capital or human capital years outstanding compared upon what does that mean workers\nAre Walker our workers are very well trained mhm uh the ... the workout thanks very strong as opposed to going to the beach as opposed to hit you think that's the funniest not I'm telling you I I'm telling you from the horse's mouth are mean roundtable discussion is how do we get people that are graduating college and trade schools\nTo come here and not just call off and say I'm going to the beach day 'cause that's literally what they tell you ... and they don't care because they bad work ethic that work ethic ... there's the trust funds the wealth is down there so tremendous in addition to that they can quit a Fifteen Eighteen dollar an hour job tomorrow\nAnd get on the next day it doesn't matter surplus of jobs are just there\nAnd we saw what we did as a business developing board as we said well let's attract hedge funds down to Palm Beach and so while I'm telling you that is oh we found that we will never get we're not going to be on a tractor manufacturing most it's just not going to happen but Florida has no income tax\nAnd you know it was ... in Connecticut\nHow can I give you a commoner it has no income tax but let me tell you what they do have they all tax everything on your property taxes high down there this is what my brother's a seven property taxes the same exact does here by the way\nFor ... well yeah but it's still expensive down there and if for example you need a permit for everything you know put it in the air conditioner you need a permit you got to put in a granite counter granite countertop you need a permit ... anything you do any improvement you make on your house you got to go for a minute or steps it's gonna be a permanent right I agree and the reason for that permit is to raise your taxes\nIt is but here me out that's not what you're worried about us fear hedge fund if you're bringing in forty to fifty million dollars to a billion dollars we're having a year in a year in New York you're going to you're paying ridiculous taxes in Connecticut so how does this translate to your original question\nWe have not found our next year\nWe that's what drives me crazy is why haven't we we have ... I I talk to you know about that before he got elected why haven't we formed a business development board where it's a group of folks maybe the ... and John Arlington everybody that wants to or to succeed why don't we haven't formed this board\nTo call folks looking for cheap square footage why haven't we reached out and say we got this tax them even for you we have all these things we have this affordable housing we have this beautiful country club in the lake level we have milk Creek Park\nMake gift giving as simple as stopping at Austin Town going chocolates here in the west as well as a as a quarter of ... forty six and mounting avenue and I'll sit down and remember whether it's a wedding special occasion or business event us instead of going John Deere can handle it all on line had Lawrence Boston town dot com\nThat's often happily for now offering a reward for any information leading to the identification and arrested three men said robbing at five guys and burger killing the whole thing caught on surveillance tape they're offering a five thousand dollar aboard five guys on state route ... takes us Rob Saturday August Eighteenth just before ten pm\nThey waved around a weapon during the robbery\nThe governor's race to Cleveland with less than a month before election day Democrat Richard Cordray Anna Republican Mike DeWine will meet tonight in that third and final debate at Cleveland State the candidates has spent much of their time gabbing over the other fitness for the state's top job\nAnd the deadline to register to vote in this year's midterm elections is tomorrow across Ohio officials also say in addition to Tuesday's registration deadline early in person voting began on Wednesday this week\nFrom the our Chevrolet Buick GMC of Calcutta, Ohio news or I Am I'm ...

I was for\nThis is a much different right I was for you know\nVacations and holiday pay and sick time off and making sure somebody didn't get a job because they turned fifty five almost one for all that but\nDon't you feel manatee don't you feel okay we don't have a problem with ISIS don't you feel things are going pretty good right now actually but here's my point\nThat's not what the Democratic Party has any more than a crack party shopping um you know men and the grown women's back into women's bathroom ... Hollywood liberal\nA limousine people that's nonsense that's not my dad and my my family stood for that's not what Youngstown was and that's the ... the Democrats represent\nAnd when you see like the the the earnings from companies coming in are good\nThey're great they're going to be this and they're going to be unbelievably record breaking again this quarter especially because why not so bad at ... I ... I Can't talking guarantees an absolute so I ... I Believe that's what's gonna happen I've been in the past eight times I said that\n[laughter] I think ... and a quarter I think he predicted the Indians would win a series\nI don't know [laughter] I have I had to give you a cheap shot I thought I Would get a look I gave it up put it off\nNow than it is so if you're worried about the market letting a little bit of ... right now don't you want this I'm not tell you what setting up right now so ... was setting up as a Santa Claus rally\nSo if the markets full steam ahead of September\nAnd it goes in the third quarter or and the third quarter and as as going going going going going it's going to have to deflate somewhere probably in the year it's just the way it goes but ... the beautiful part about what's going on now is the teams being released a little bit and and and mid October\nAnd probably the third week of October and you'll see it start to pump up and level out in stabilized probably mid November and get ready for a kick out Santa Claus rally\nAnd 'cause that's where companies make their money that's were CEO's make their bonuses that's where\nYou know shareholders get rewarded et cetera so\nUh they're trying to pump up their earnings per share as much as possible and make their their balance sheets will because as good as possible for people with traditional fiscal years so uh at the end of the day if\nYou're if you're one of these folks that are worried her hanging on the market was X amount of points and it's my time to eat the markets not for you that lesson was down today and as they are now you know that the NASDAQ which is why is that it's just like the steam out as we\nKnow now they said the underlying analysts Macy's interest rates listen we need that interest rate increase their best to keep down inflation caress to keep down inflation and and conquer the corner TV according to the quantitative easing that's been going on which\nWas the ease of getting money in in layman's terms and you know\nFor what to say what she doesn't nine\nWe're the most ... percent interest rates that means companies were getting and banks were getting money at very little cost and all\nAnd the ... the ... the money supply was very inexpensive if you let that go on for too long you're going to create a crazy inflationary environment\nAnd then it's going to have a reverse effect of why does interest rates go up after the ... down\nAnd and you know that will make bond prices go down more than they should uh but but back to what my point was is a yeah it's the control the money supply control the inflationary environment so study so I think it's fair and healthy\nAre you seeing inflation or talk a little bit of inflation as a whole\nI I I haven't seen crazy inflation but if you just look at\nI'm Brett you look at your your everyday grocery earlier when you look at your cable bill oh yeah you look at your your your your your cell phone bills just look at the everyday things that are going up there it's a it's death by a thousand cuts they're slowly they'll attack on an extra dollar here an attack on an extradition talk on an extra fear\nAnd really what it is as a counterbalance their costs of going up okay so sorry about that so um basically I I like the ... I like what's going on here\nWith a slight interest rate increase it was needed I told you it was going to happen to did it's probably going to happen again and it's a good thing it's healthy it's it's it's really healthy thing for the market in this pullback is very healthy if you know\n... good for the ... from an investment standpoint because of December to go exactly and I'll tell you is\nYou're still bullish right I'm very ... show\nPeople getting in and getting on board with me now are getting lucky if they've had cash or coming from another visor that wasn't so great\nI'm you know we're going to be on the by Amazon's in the Eighteen hundreds versus two thousand\nAre going about pick up some high as her gee if you know on a you know with a coupon or we're gonna be able to pick up square with the ... the the things I mentioned the radio before and again it's not a buyer sells recommendations is something I'm Talking about doing my own my own so don't buy based on that but\nPeople getting in with me right now are going to get just getting lucky he\nMade like forget it has all the ... you got a meeting tonight I Know you're right you're you're going out so when when somebody comes in in his meeting with you today or tomorrow or something like that\nAre now ... there's Michael I'm Serious event so lucky time for them to come out I Would say to you and if they're coming out of the bank or if they're coming from another thing it's a good\nTime to get it let me get example people who came to me it would be August you know they're not experienced that that those crazy results that people have got got with me and since January\nThey're going to get him eventually I Believe in mean based on what I think the market's going to do but you know they they made a bunch of money in October or September in August but we take that we've taken a lot of the games back\nSo I looked like a normal advisory now but again I'm I'm a leader talk while he was all cost averaging or just hang tight because I think there's a lot more room to go on the things we have but people getting in", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "08"}
