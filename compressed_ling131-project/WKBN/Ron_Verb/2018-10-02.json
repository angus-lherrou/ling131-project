fifth term frat parties if advances were unwanted I pushed the personal way and set personal boundaries I chose to be parts of the party scene because of this I had fun and I have regrets\nI had been assaulted and not raped I could a replay of scenario like Christine foreign described as very similar to things that happened when excessive drinking occurred in my own experiences\nAt the age of twenty five I settled down and now my idea of excitement is Netflix and yoga pants if any of my current patient saw my behavior back then I could understand why they would want me or I could understand why they wouldn't want me to care for them\nI feel like being a physician is every bit as important as being a Supreme Court justice the decisions we make over the span of our careers could change the lives of thousands of people and their descendants for years to come the same can be said for the Supreme Court or any other political office held\nThe thing is poor choices in the past does not and should not disqualify them\nI a shrug to bankers club whiskey in a cornfield impede behind a dumpster twenty five years ago but friday I use tiny instruments to remove infected bony

educating myself and sacrificing countless hours to get there\nI gave up so much to be good at what I Do to be confident enough in myself to put myself out there to care for people who put their lives in my hands\nMy character is built partially on learning from mistakes Brett Kavanaugh has devoted his life to public service and the past Twenty years of his life is the definition of integrity he deserves disappointments I Am against the weaponization of victimhood believing unequivocally that women\nIn the bleeding unequivocally a woman is right every single time no matter what is giving women power to take out any one in their path\nThat is not equality this radical position is not the answer to gender discrimination and victims rights\nNo one can ever no one can even place Brett Kavanaugh and Christine forward in the same room at the party that zero people recollect except for the woman making accusations every single woman must be believed every single time we all know here\nLet me give this if every single woman must be believed every single time we all know there will be circumstances by which someone will use this power for selfish reasons\nIt sets women back so far this is not breaking the glass ceiling this is not just this this is wrong All right so that was a Facebook post by a female Dr there I thought that was interesting to pass along to you\nBasically [noise] see I think that there's some of that I think you know that there's there are thinking from a political standpoint it let me put it this way the Democratic party is just wacko fail to me anymore I mean it really is it is absolute wacko fill\nThat I've spoken to numerous times they just solely lost their direction during the election they abandon their base they totally abandoned the working class a totally that's why Trump carry Ohio Pennsylvania and\nMichigan they were out of touch with their with their base for years they thought they could cater to every wacko group out there and they didn't need to worry about their base seriously and that's why they lost to Trump in these places they if they know it's a I don't know if they'll ever acknowledge it but that is the reason\n[noise] and now they're philosophy as well uh women will side with this woman because they're all women\nAnd I don't think that's the case you\nKnow as I said women also have husbands and sons and brothers\nAnd ah you know I think there's gonna be plenty of women that say you're assuming that I Will side with her because she's a woman and then I'm not gonna use my brain and listen to this and that nobody can substantiate it what if that was that what happened to somebody accusing my father or brother or son of this\nSo they're at the Democratic party isn't viewing women is thinkers they're just saying well because they're women they'll side with her because she's a woman or a woman [noise]\nUh and quite frankly the Republican Party is a little guilty of that as I started by saying well we can't have men questioning this woman it'll look bad as opposed to saying yes we can have men as a as human beings we can amend question her in an intelligence uh and well mannered way\nAnd\nUh they didn't do that either so there's a lot of stereotypes that are being floated out there that I think are just flat out inaccurate Enron [noise]\nAh what's that being said it amazes me that the latest debate though that it's going on now this keeps its flu and it keeps changing\nHow much beer did he drink when he was in high school and college\nI mean this is ridiculous\nI mean it's just ridiculous\nI mean ... do you not see it through this I mean you know first of all the whole Democratic Party with their\nMob mentality in ... the Oregon is organized chaos that they like to do I I'm not for that at all I I just it that this mob mentality of there's troubles me as an American a great deal troubles me as an American a great deal [noise]\nThinking somebody is guilty and has to prove their innocence troubles me a great deal [noise] and they're constantly you know with this whole thing you knew from the day that they decided to do this FBI investigation and dig and give it that week you knew every anyone who had half a brand new that wouldn't be enough for these folks\nBecause it really is about a running o'clock out hoping they wouldn't have mid term elections a stall in this whole thing because the reality is they don't want this kind of Supreme Court so this is all political\nSo this is a oh well it started as is our concern now now you're hearing well we don't know if he has the temperament to be on a Supreme Court you know like he was screaming and hollering even though we as forceful in his defense of himself and his family over some ludicrous charges\nThat are that are being made his way\nI think just as anyone would be but\nYou know now now now you're hearing from the ... we don't know if he has the temperament to be on the court now it's well how exactly how much did he drank when he was in high school and college how much beer did he actually drink it keeps changing because this is all about stalling it\nAnd even if the FBI investigation comes back and say now it pretty much is we have learned anything more than we learn from the basic hearing\nNow will the Democrats are oh then we're going to vote for him because that's a pretty well settled up to you know nothing could be a proved if you will so we're going to support him\nOr the same people say well I just believe or it doesn't matter what the investigation says oh well the same people say you get what I'm saying about this these are frightening times Trump at a statement the other day\nTrump data statements the other day uh he says it's a very scary time for
