...\nWhat's going on in our country and it seems to me that one of the few people fighting against this this is our president and I think we should support him and and I think a lot of Americans feel that way I just try and find a way to reach out\nTo those who are not the kind of not really I mean they would they would if they went out and actually voted I get to that and I reached goes to\nAnd

remember we don't want to encourage people from coming here with their children\nBecause they think they can get into the country quicker and easier when they come here with their children and we don't want to encourage that\nAnd that's why they had this process\nAnd of course the fuel goods out their thought this was a terrible thing to do and so the whole thing has been reversed as a result

child\nI'm Scott Goldberg for the first time President Trump is saying it looks like the missing Washington Post journalist ... show he is\nDead President Trump says it appears ... show he was murdered in ...\nBeen working I had been working for this company for almost Thirty years\nNow my question like question is the signed contract you have yes is it is it for\nPer year and a renews yearly how do they don't\nKnow it was in her ... year deal it was a ongoing uh since I signed on with these guys are X amount of salary they got increased ah in time\nOkay but I'm assuming you ever written contracts somewhere right\nYeah like what is the term of the contract\nThere's no there's no uh no expiration date no expert now new expiration date it was just that uh you know I've got a phone call from our garage and our company\nYeah we're here near here Don here no non\nGuys our company is that we're gonna have to cut back our a number of our employees do you take a reduction in a in a salary and I agreed to help 'em out because I work with him for so long gone\nI'll do that and why beer curve and we're going to I'm going to uh pay you back when we get up to speed\nDog first of all you've got all somebody has to look at the contract preferably a lawyer and interpret that or if the contract of for example has claws that they cannot terminate you unless they have quote good cause close quote\nThat you might have an argument as to whether they had good cause to terminate you and I think California might even having the statue to good cause requirement but I'm not sure though\nYeah civil here here's what I'm telling you should do you should take that contract call our office are calling other lawyers office but make an appointment let someone interpret that contract would you'd definitely from what you've described to me in my opinion have a cause of action against direct employer\nWell I uh I have a couple of friends of mine that are also lawyers one of them are in California and a couple and Florida are just been great friends over the years\nAnd uh you know they say Hey Don me to go after the guys and um you know and figure out how you\nCan do this right done where do you live\n\nQuestioned on one yeah go ahead\nWhere do you live currently set on Salem yeah Ohio okay All right what's your other question\nA question doesn't pretend that any of that\nUm you know I've been traveling all over the country have been traveling internationally and stuff like that everywhere I go I have to have a patch worked including recently went in the last two years in New Mexico Canada\nAnd back and forth why one age people come in and cry sharp border why can't they just walk up we're going to say where's your passport ... where do you want to come and ...\nBecause people are ... are crossing the border illegally yeah they're doing it illegally\nYeah but why why when a crisis of war or why do we let them in\nWe don't let them and they we don't do they don't get caught well wait a minute they they they can plead a rite of asylum right and and then go through the process\nAnd so they let them in I think temporarily to plead asylum and then they uh they they look at the individuals and suddenly turned back some they are allowed to stay here in order to go through a court proceeding\nRight yeah we're gonna that never happens and I just I just thought okay when they show up with their border there's like four thousand out there\nThe coming now to America and I would just say where's your passport right well if they don't it doesn't matter what they said to me by her by wind or if I tried to come in through Ken All right we\nCan get it All right let's go to who's been waiting the longest next David you have a legal question\nDavid\nHello I got a question for you I was a few weeks back um got a photo speeding ticket from Gerard right and that was traveling south on eleven right where it comes in a seven eleven and the speed limit drops from sixty five fifty\nFive I'm not quite sure where they\nThe picture is that I was going sixty six so I'm assuming they're saying I was going that speed after it switched to fifty five but it was right in that area\nSo my question is if I had request can ministry of hearing and they sent me a letter and they put this wording in your says this please be aware that ... to a revised coated and a bunch of numbers that the recorded images are preying on Fox I I don't know what the\nWord is a show evidence of the tropical violation what does that mean\nThat means there's a presumption that it was you\nAt first glance at it at ... the first the first instinct is that this is accurate\nOkay so um I guess I mean I I'm assuming I was driving a car I'm ...\nI mean I was driving a car but my my question is is how as the driving a car or how do I know where they actually\nWell I think you're not going as speed that ... on ... they were going to have to show you where the where the speed reduces\nI have a family member that has made me somewhat of an expert on the cameras so I have attended some different of hearings on behalf of a certain family member who will remain nameless but\nA first of all you have to get in the ... you have to appeal it within thirty days limit if you're beyond a thirty day window they're not going to listen to you you call a call center to try to to appeal it and they'll set up an appeal date with the court if it's beyond thirty days they won't do it they say you have to pay the ticket\nOnce you appear you we'll check in the people that do appear and check and you go before a hearing officer okay if you have a valid legitimate argument\nThe hearing officer will give you consideration the hearing offer an officer depending on your argument\nWould may consider reducing your fine\nOr dismissing it altogether if it's a legitimate argument now understand you have a right to confront your accuser so if you show up and say\nI dispute where they took this picture there's a speed zone I'm sixty five going into a fifty five I think I was still in the sixty five then that person has to be there to testify if they don't show up that ticket should be dismissed\nHey here's something else where you are just as a side note somebody sent me a somebody the thing on it just as a side note for everybody listening\nYou if you don't pay that tickets or it's a ... they don't report it to their credit reporting agencies because it's it's the there's thirty five states that don't report it Ohio is being one of them because there's no written agreements\nOr as far as the contract that you entered into so here's here's what happens you get the tickets you don't pay it they call you and say you are they send you late fees then they say they turn it over to collection and you don't pay that then after that you know what happens nothing they never appears on your on your credit report because it's\nIn violation of a violation of not a traffic or criminal ...\nBut it is not a written contract that appears will hurt your credit report at all so you know ...\nWhat about if you are when you go to a review your tags or you go\nTo his no ... no effect zero so civil violation ... as a matter\nOf fact I'll get that article out now if you call me tomorrow I'll be in the studio and I will redo that article that that's it's from all three credit reporting\nAction there are no there are no points to fix that so that there would be no mark on your driver's license\nOkay All right well I think you've said something about I have to appeal this within thirty days I immediately requested the disorder straight appearing within two weeks of of this ticket being issued to me is that requesting administrative hearing\nYes same as appealing yes yes okay\nAnd you'll get something in the mail or I don't know if you did it on line or on the phone or how you did it but you will get us or something in the mail with your court date and you would\nChoke I already received that oh well then they\nSaid that that's what that what I call you about that primo she evidence that's I didn't understand what they meant\nBy that first impression yes\nThough he has to be able to prove that I was in that fifty five mile an hour area how did they do that it's just his word against my\nProvider someone from the other side shows up right exactly\nThey might not show up All right okay okay I Am very Monday\nI think I think that guy do good 'cause you don't celebrate so he might judge might take sympathy on\nWell hey game and look at his trial if you if you could say I've never had a meeting crawling someone you're saying that you think someone doesn't sound right [laughter] okay I just\nDon't have to make sure that we got that down but did you know that I mean I got\nThat article or there it's not a lot of there's a bunch of states where am\nI don't I don't know I'd have to see the article you're already I'd like to see it as well Ron than it is\nIt it does not go reported on your credit at all\nCan you make me a copy of that I can see that yes I can I just got off one of the if you saw it on the Internet it has to be\nI I Will absolutely make all of you a copy of\nEnron what how that changes everything what happens if that changes\nIt does it isn't changing it is ... is there is no written contract that they that they will not take the reports of you not paying that took a ... and has no effect on\nOh really yeah what ... what do you mean what is there are some big meeting\nOr

be looking forward to that source Brian cop tomorrow morning subbing for day Beatrice on the television show right so that should be interesting to be hard I think and and I want you to have an enjoyable time in gossip in New York City\nI live in New York and a twelve years I'm just not a big city guy writes my God have you ever lived in New York City run yes I have been how long ago or ...\nOr ... went back when the September eleventh happened with the the radio station sent me that the I think today after that happened down rivers and I went to after that shortly thereafter so it goes way back to that I'm trying to think if there's been other times but it's been it's been a long time it's not my scene either I'm not crazy about it\nYeah the the thing I remember most about is how loud it is and how dirty the city is that's what I never\nAnd they don't have young people who can do the jobs to Judy's yo semi skilled manufacturing jobs they said they get a lot of young people and a twenty well why\nAre they will show up for the interview and only two or three can pass the drug test so you know it\nYou see we have a labor market where there's a lot of people out of work up through can't get into the labor market for whatever whatever reason whether it's drugs or whether it's you know they don't want to work for that but we have an economy that's doing well and the needs more skilled trained labor especially manufacturing\nWhy do you think the economy is doing so well right now what lift this economy on fire\nWell I think you know the New York times a couple of weeks ago had this peace and it's really important that you and your listeners read it about how there was a industrial recession twenty six\nSo even though the economy was still growing in terms of manufacturing capital investment building new machines all that went into recession at the end of twenty Fifteen the beginning of twenty six\nSo I I Know you're going to walk horses said well we're just joined the benefits of the Obama years but that's actually not true when you look into the numbers the manufacturing sector of our economy went into recession twenty sixteen what changed has been coated vacation of the tax or\nWe start to encourage capital investment we changed the depreciation schedule so that people couldn't best they can buy new machinery and equipment now and then write it off their taxes lower the tax rates in I think most crucially for workers we started raising these tariffs and cutting imports from China\nOr from other countries so areas you know we're\nLosing jobs because it's cheap imports now all of a sudden and we've got a little bit of protection to help them stabilized for industries while their workers to breed and to gain some ground on the waitress so I think a combination of all these factors is really helping to drive the economy\nWhat were your thoughts are we're talking with Danny Davis our economic ... what were your thoughts about a NAFTA finally be renegotiated by the Trump Administration they don't even call it NAFTA anymore it's USC I made a but it's been totally redone comments about that\nYeah so I think this is a um I don't think this was a home run in my opinion a home run would have been completely scrap NAFTA but I think this was a solid double\nUm so I think it definitely moved the ball forward for workers and here's what's really crucial that I think is very good it's not enough play\nThe new uh NAFTA agreement the U.S see I'm a I think is what they're calling it mandates that workers in Mexico have to get paid sixteen dollars and a half an hour\nNow why is that poor wise equipment Mexicans are making more money well because it stops being sucking sound of companies relocating to Mexico\nTo take advantage of lower wage costs and so it sounds as for the first time in the international trade agreement minimum wages in other countries in these third world developing countries which prevents companies for relocate you ultimately it's a good thing if they're making more\nBecause companies aren't going to be shutting down factories here\nRelocating them in Mexico and taking advantage of the cheap labor so that is I think very important benefit potentially could we to the relocating in the inside or seen of automobile manufacturing in the United states and the other key thing that I don't think it's enough appreciation\nUh is the fact that it's going to be revisited every six years so NAFTA when it was passed that was it was done and it just stayed that way well now there's a pause it opens and invites you know this new agreement to be revisited every six years so this isn't good enough\nTo start pushing back manufacturing the United states we have an opportunity in six years to push for more changes so it's an incremental reform it's not the slam dunk that I Would want it to be but I think is a big big movement in the right direction\nAnd is and it's a huge step I mean because other of presidents both Republican and Democrat\nDidn't see this issue at all they didn't do anything about this issue I don't know if that's because the lobbyists or I don't know if that's just because they were a few fearful of it who knows what the cost of cost of it really was but these guys with the Trump Administration finally did something about it step in the right direction now\nDo you think the Trump starts with a hardcore approach you know we're going to put put tariffs on you were going to do this we're gonna do that to automatically bring people to the table to ultimately get them to negotiate and come up with a deal with a better interest of the United states\nYeah I Do I think and the other thing I think he does that is is crucial is he's not afraid to alienate are allies are so called outlet for example the European Union and the United states is currently in major trade negotiations with the European Union and what\nBrought them to the table run and this does exactly what you said was he said OK if you don't come to the table I'm going to put twenty five percent terrorists\nOn German auto exports which are crucial for the European economy\nOr Germany is really the lynchpin of the entire European industrial system\nSo he said I'm going to put twenty five percent auto imports and Mercedes Audi a BMW and the light and it's bringing them to the table we'll see if an agreement made but I think you know I I give the guy credit because he's willing to risk personal embarrassment\nOr to force our allies are so called allies Canada Mexico the Europeans Japan to the table to get a better deal for the United states I think that's crucial I think a lot of presidents\nJust wanted to let the system right you know it's one thing an election year they promised they look at these agreements and then when it came time to actually you know put money on the table they would just whatever the negotiators negotiated that's what they would sign so yeah I I agree with you\nAnd he did the same thing when you when you were talking in a previous interview you were saying you did the same thing when it came to them paying two per cent of the G A GDP until you may know rights I mean he did he didn't care what they thought of him personally saying you guys haven't been living up to your obligations\nYeah and and look and I think it's important to more than actually how much they pay you and they're going to be paying more is the rhetoric changed because no longer is that while you know please pay more it's\nPay more or we're going to take concrete steps and that nobody was willing to venture in great that damn now once that dams been broken though it changes the entire dynamics of the discussion same with the tariffs on China I mean I I Can't stress you how important it is\nIf in eight states finally standing up against the Chinese and putting terrorists on their imports and the u._s. um it's a crucial victory for workers\nYou know they did studies where they estimated approximately one third of all manufacturing job losses are due to China joined the world Trade Organization in two thousand and one\nOf the fact that we're now putting terrorists up against the Chinese is saying you know no longer it's gonna happen I think it's a huge victory I think there's something over a hundred billion dollars worth of terrorists threatening even more tariffs on Chinese good this is something people talked about for ten Twenty years never been done until now\nAnd Trump Trump is coming forward with the argument when it comes to China he says\nHe ... the Chinese need us more than we need them because they need our marketplace we got to stop it basically to paraphrase it stop acting like the when we are actually in the driver's seat it's a different perspective that he's going into these negotiations with\nYeah doing the tariffs and everything to say here are the consequences to bring them to the table but ultimately in some of the comments I heard him say he says they're going to come to the table because they need us they need our marketplace do you agree with that\nI agree look here's something people should keep in mind when people say well China has all our debt they control us well kind of gas and kind of know and that's such an odd mix ... economists answer but\nIf the Chinese they hold all these treasuries if they start selling them in math is a way to mess with us\nWell then the remaining treasuries that they own will drop and values so don't hurt themselves more ultimately then they'll hurt us and there'll be other buyers at the end of the day if they start selling all their treasury bonds the Japanese were by the Europeans will buy you know the middle Easterners will buy it so they're only going to be hurting themselves\nSo and the other thing too he makes a good point we are a net importer from China so when we put on terrorists were not really hurting our exporting sector China tried all these tariffs on us imports and the China\nThey implemented the first round round two came they ran out of the list of things are good they buy from the U.S that they could put tariffs on so we really do have the advantage because they're they're so dependent upon us on exporting to us but you know we only have the advantage for so long I don't know if you saw the story and Bloomberg\nHave to stand by

to you I Can't imagine five years ago or even three years ago or even two years ago\nThat we would be where we are economically in this country that we would see a resurgence as far as manufacturing is concerns we we we have politicians have basically said well this is the way it is trained for something else write it off\nA give up on it already and ... or ... people that would say something about these trade agreements and do nothing about them\nI mean when I look at the things happening with our economy right now\nFrankly it's unbelievable to me how well it's doing and how ... how one man has changed so dramatically not just in manufacturing but at all facets of its would you agree with that comment\nYeah I I think we've made a lot of progress my worry is you know the economy is spinning expansion says two thousand nine thousand ten vote\nEvery economic expansion is kind of limited you know there's a natural cycle the things you get eight years of growth your recession eight more years or grow so on and so forth there is a business cycle\nSo my worry is we've been in the business cycle for so long road not even over the last ...\nYears growth has been turbo charged that\nYou know I think within twenty twenty we should be looking at a recession probably very very mild but it's coming but what we should be focusing on his game made and twenty seven twenty eight and hopefully next year at twenty Ninety ... more than offset any little bit of retrenchment we have\nA twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one whatever that eventually happen that's the big concern on my mind I also think we should use this opportunity to fix a lot of our structural problems\nUm you know we've been given a grace period the economy's doing well now but instead of spending I think we really need to use it to pay down the debt tighten up the budget you know making investments in infrastructure that we need to be making these sort of things need to be happening now\nWild things are good so that we can prepare for Wendy's or not so good at that makes sense\nWhat are you are you worried about inflation and the fed raising interest rates\nSo here's a really important point I'm thinking about this a lot\nEverybody what these terrorists that we'd be getting inflation well actually we have it in places around around two percent or it hasn't even gone over three percent yet that's my that's where we should be that the science about the economy I think the two biggest threat to the economy from where we are today\nNumber one is that the threat that gets too aggressive they tighten too quickly to strongly\nUm they sent interest rates up its consumer spending and that plunging us into recession so that's my first worries with the Federal Reserve\nMy second worries with oil so inflation's low oil prices have been trying to get up and they build a fruit throughout the entire economy so you know states something goes bad with Saudi Arabia or with the Iranians are are that in oil prices go up that's going to hit the economy is going to hit the manufacturing sector\nIn particular it'll get consumer spending that those are the big right\nIn my mind inflation terrorists trade or none of that has been hurting the economy that's all been helping in my opinion a you know what people complain about CNBC again I don't think that's the big ... big threat is interest rates go up too fast in oil goes up\nToo fast in fact in fact a lot of the concern that people expressed early on as far as terrorists and that kind of stuff and how prices would spike\nNone of that really has happened to overwhelmingly I mean you heard about how much more would add to a car and how much more it would cost you to buy your your pop in aluminum cans and that kind of stuff a lot of that was nothing more than scare tactics correct\nExactly right wrong when you when you have to get the financial press\nA lot of these reporters are you know they're straight out of college for whatever they hear from corporate leaders okay so I find still says all these terrorists are going to put me out of business they'll report that as the gospel does he have any basis in reality look insurance rates are excuse me inflation rate\nI've been around ... percent they haven't gone up\n... prices have actually been trendy down recently they haven't been going up\nI'm a woman up prices same thing so all these all these scare mongering about prices would skyrocket or people would lose their jobs it happen happen don't forget he put tariffs on solar panel manufacturing everybody said that would destroy solar panel jobs here in the United states the opposite\nIs true solar panel manufacturing jobs have gone up so they get a lot of this scare mongering that we heard last year it hasn't been\nBored out with Tara I'm ... and just ask yourself a simple question okay if terrorists were so bad why did the Chinese the Japanese and Korean the German the Taiwanese every major industrialized calling me the Canadians Mexicans out the Brazilians why are they all have air", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Verb", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "18"}
