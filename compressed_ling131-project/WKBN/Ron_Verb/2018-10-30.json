how far back that goes but was another one in an office to before no now okay well anyway\nIf this is the worst the the tourist district and the highest unemployment in the state and she is an opening officers you know is that something she shouldn't be held accountable for\nBut that's not what they do they they cut all their misery and then they blame it on you know the euro opponents are the Republicans basically right\nLook look the reality is she's been there and she's done nothing about the two biggest issues facing that everyone complains about the rainy day fund and the highway fund she's done absolutely nothing about it she hasn't spearheaded anything about it she's done nothing other than collect a paycheck\nPeriod so why would I mean why would I vote for her you know I mean I I have the opportunity to vote now I make no mistake I Will vote for dates Simon when anybody\nWhy would anybody in their right mind that lives around here\nI don't know I I don't know why you would

hello there\nOh Ron how're you doing today I'm well sir thank you for calling and go ahead\nOkay what the caller I have to agree with one thing you really have changed I moved down here from buffalo and ah like for the Rosh ... I moved down here about nine years ago you were really Obama's\nBorder well I voted for Obama\nAnd you really believe that um and I know why you believe in him because he wanted to say well he was running that he was going to change in like in Buffalo like Youngstown there was\nA lot of 'em I saw move out it was devastated in Buffalo\nAnd it was a young scholar I guess ... and and I figure I really believe that Obama is going to change it\nLet me let me like things on you because you bring up a good point or two things I think that uh the first of all they claim they would do something about NAFTA and secondly\nHe was addressing healthcare which I thought was a huge problem at the time and I still think is a huge problem a ... ... with trying to fix health care I mean health care costs at the time we're going up\nAnywhere from eight to twelve percent a year and he was talking about fixing health care and he he did something to it and I believe Obamacare's here to stay I don't think it's going to change anytime soon but it certainly didn't deliver what he said it would you know as far as lower prices and you'd be able to keep your doctor a lot of the stuff he promised didn't come true\nThat's true and I I I really amazed how much you change and Trump is a guy that you are\nGets results and that's why you people out there that used to know you as a big Obama supporter and now you're real Trump supporter because you see the results it's right there in front of your eyes I'll give you argue about it\nWhile you're at a standby hanging out of a comeback to okay I promise I got a call center and I might get back to him I think\nHe's making some good points I Want to talk to him further we got another hour to go sell the motorcycle show at the\nTime it's five o'clock and shot their brothers fine hardwood Rory road can be used radio\nFive seven you Katie a young child\nScott Goldberg President Trump and the first lady are now in Pittsburgh where a gunman killed eleven people Saturday inside the tree of life synagogue at the same time demonstrators are marching\nI'm he goes for as President Trump lands here to visit\nOh that's good to hear like I said I was that guy is that guy that I'm not going to listen to your\nOn well that's all right I remember when I first started listen I Would say that they think about you write about Obama's theme\nRight well you you know that's the way it goes Obama was a disappointment but man enough to say it was a disappointment but I'm also here to say I don't think you're going to see any changes in health care I really I I met and more and more convinced that Obamacare the longer it's it's all around the harder it is to unravel I really think it's here to stay and I think\nThey started to stop that and they couldn't\nWell already tiger so thanks buddy pre shit\nYeah and I said I I listen to your values are and you know well there you go I used to like the rush\nWas good they are out here that I can lift the Russia I\nMean ... ... you know the you know again\nWell you're a good man thank you sir appreciate it to\nYou know I mean it really is in all seriousness to to most of you I've been disappointed for most of most of it I I don't interview a lot of local politicians anymore you want to know why because they get sick and tired of the BS and the lion and doing nothing\nAnd local politicians I mean it was just like so then I started sitting back as I say to all of you and I sit back and I follow this kind of stuff and that's why it doesn't matter to me of John Boccieri some veteran doesn't matter means he's got five kids\nHe's getting sixty thousand plus dollars a year in great benefits and a great retirement he should be earning it and I don't think he's earning it\nI don't think he's done squat about the two biggest issues I don't think so when I say to all of you it's not about party it's about that it has this person done anything they do that you know of you yourself just don't go by many as ... done anything anything\nThat's mattered in your life how about Michele a poor Hagen\nAbout any of these people that's why I that's why I put it out there I'm not one of these people let's say you know whether the oh this this this and that kinda stuff\nAnd let's be realistic it's a largely democratic area and these people just take the votes for granted you know I find it in ... minutes with ... you know ... when you try to get out of this cesspool of political corruption\nA in large part because one party feels that they're so strong that they can do anything and get reelected and that's just the way it's going to be\nAnd you know when you get away from this political corruption then it comes to rear end right back with you know one hand washes the other and then what's so what's going on there it's disgusting\nAnd it hurts the area but I think a lot of people in the Democratic party locally think while they'll get reelected no matter what they do yeah that's why when I say Tim Ryan is more interested in his future in sucking up to Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic party than representing his constituents are playing a game and the best interest of his district\n\nAnd that's sad that he's lost set focus he's become a politician he's become a politician interested in his own career\nHe says a bunch of stuff but it means nothing\nYou know and if I ask people\nWell can you tell me what traffic content and ... and Joe baggage doughnuts while the other ... valley center the seven eleven connector the airbase people the courthouses downtown people can search you and stuff off when it happened\nA long time ago and I can't do that with Tim Ryan\nAfter sixteen years\nDo I think he'll win probably because you know people just say okay I'm going to vote again for the same guy and you'll get the same mediocre performance\nI mean he can't even go and and to to say the Trump you know hey you know what the economy is doing really well since the tax cuts and the economy is doing really well since regulation cuts and people in my district did get a bonuses and raises from local companies\n\nAnd by the way I'm Glad somebody really fix this situation with NAFTA and acknowledge that the candidate they supported wouldn't have done any of this stuff but you'll never hear that that's why I say it's too political there is no honesty to it and that's why can't support if there's just no honesty doing\nWith Traficant here at least had that ability to just lay it out there\n\nYou know if I Would say if I was a township trustee or if I was a\nMayor or in the school system\nThat has been bichon constantly about the local government fun not coming back and I was a Democrat do you think that'd be voting for Democrats who've done nothing about it other than make excuses no\nBut they all we'll all fall in line and vote for the same people in their party even though they've done nothing about the big problem they they've been bichon about I think that's ridiculous I think it's stupid\n\nAnd just think it's an absolute stupidity and I really don't think people are ... ... there's a mentality that they're entitled or they're going to stay with the job so I think it's time for change I think it's the it's best if others have opportunities I support term limits in these areas that want to get rid of them like in Youngstown for ...
