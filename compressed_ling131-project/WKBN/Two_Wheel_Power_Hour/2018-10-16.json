W E instead of the uh that six fifty's plenty\nPotent ah oh yeah I've taken one of those are on a demo right and I was totally shocked at the performance the acceleration uh the motors a strong motor and and when you run we're a stock you know you're not going to have a five hundred ninja to compete against the six fifty\nYeah they were in Knoxville that was the only place we ran into any uh any really bad traffic we got into some stuff and go and we're getting low on fuel and his his joy came on as Richard light came on and then I started flashing\nSo he was he was really rushing ... is a company and buy a house yeah [laughter] well let's ask about the gadgets 'cause you're known as al the gadget guy can you tell me a little bit about or any of the new gadget you employ dish might just bought a new a bad at all or\nTennis so uh I mean I took I had an ass yeah the new X. X. men\nAt not at all oh I thought it was like a ... ...\nNo no well\nAnd then I understand now you're fidgeting you no longer do was go pros now use something else\nI have a garment camera but I don't use it very often but I have the garment on her 'cause then I can control it with through my garment GPS okay you know there was a pretty good yeah oh yeah I have a monitored on there and\nYou know I I uh bought off the ... the head of the Ohio division of the motorcycle sport turning association a brand new\nA remote control yeah from mine and it's just like a little watch thing and it's got a strap and you put it right over your bar over your break reservoir and I\nActually followed a Youtube video and got it to work there you know accomplish me Mr low tech [laughter] so yeah I worked out pretty good now my next one is going to try and get my phone like you did for me years ago to hook up to it and I think I Know how to do that so I'm like ... you just got to remember passwords you're right above yeah\nYeah passwords are hard but ah so you're uh the new tennis you like that yeah what's the big improvement about that\nA bigger better faster but you know the screen better camera\nNoticed is I keep going and I'm probably two ... two or three generations behind you on cell phones\nAre I mean minor Ninety nine cents through the company so I don't know you know in a box of ... or something\nBut I noticed that each generation when I use the GPS it gets better like this phone now it's got a real good GPS I mean I can do it it's very very close to\nA as it comes with to a regular ... GPS or accept that you'd have to get an order box on or something to keep a waterproof but the\nOther thing I noticed is that a lot of these guys are using Google Earth is that what you use\nNo I just I use my garment five Ninety under by okay and um and I got another garment that I have in my truck I use the phone once in a while not too often but they're wondering about the new tennis is that it is or not\nIt's water resistant or so I guess it's good for a two meters for five minutes underwater\nWell that's still pretty good data bank reform easy\nYou know vibration and stuff like that so I ... ... S C I F ... sure about that Mr dikeman don't get it I think a tennis doesn't cause Ninety nine cents no well you know so little\nNow for a couple a couple of zero in front of behind\nEr and trade in near\nYeah well it's like anything you know you if you get what you pay for and get the top of the line and that's the top of the wagon I right now\nUh it's gonna cost a little bit more but uh yeah what is capable of doing next like a GPS over a phone GPS give you a lot more loyal travel information you know like Wednesday where's the library of police department to hospital a\nThe nice thing is like the ... in there that you can punch up right away called look ahead yeah right and I'll tell you about coming back with that Corvette caravan\nAnd we've got jammed up and the guy and that was leading must not have had to look ahead because the wood of look they had either good off the road and eventually my GPS\nWill then tell you\nHey you've gotta you've gotta you've drafting a traffic jam on that I could be twenty four minutes you are on the fastest route or sometimes it'll say hey we can get you out of it by punched in a way by\nIf you go to that look ahead you can look ahead further than what the GPS will tell you immediately I mean it'll get to it eventually but you may be pretty close to getting into that traffic jam when it tells you that\nWhereas when you look ahead you can kind of you can decide I did that one I went and got that forced sailboat and all of Ninety five was jammed and all I did was look ahead\nRude around and I found a road that ran parallel yeah ran through\nSome towns and that but I kept a steady sixty sixty two mile an hour and I kept looking over at a Ninety five and it was more of the wall blocked yeah yeah so oh good\nAnything else you want to report on out before we break away now we've got a great time got some you know like I said two thousand miles on it and\nThat's a nice trip you know and the weather was good so you know it may just smile and feel good and uh now did you use a any ... between you and Dave no we don't even really know that's the one thing that totally floors me you Mr gadget guy\nAnd no intercom I mean almost everybody I Know that I ride with now they want to act with each other and they try that why you don't want to talk to me yeah and I mean I Try and it's like you know and then you find yourself talked more\nInstead of paying attention more you know like only one yeah\nYeah that's one thing about him by you wind up but he\nJust constant chatter about you know I but yeah I saw the deer over there and the right yeah it's a car when the uh yeah I smelled they're fresh grass cut yeah uh yeah you wind up ah\nJobs in their life it's just a it's a lot of great stories well let's Larry touched aren't they beginning well let's fast forward to really an amazing amazing feat let's talk about a a smaller Jews temp championship in a kind\nOf what I had a twin ten championships is a pretty amazing I think I don't think they were consecutive uh I think ... ended up getting one in there somewhere\nYeah Cody and mark pressure from over in Spain had had come over and gotten the championship as well but you know just a quick story back in two thousand six uh we were we were at at at at the final event of the year and pat was standing next to be ...\nBunch of other people that was the end of the day in order to re in hand out Jeff Aaron takes the stage and he retires\nHe announces his retirement after winning ten championships so he was a ten time champion and I remember album and pat and think pat you know\nOne day that's going to be you won't be until two thousand six feet or two thousand Seventy and if you start winning next year every year but\nThat's going to be you one day in and we just kind of laughed about it went off and and this year to to see him win is tense championship and be up there with them for the pictures and you know he says the same thing I remember that day when you said you know I'm going to be a ten times champion so\nYou know that pat his work for that harder than than anybody could ever imagine because although he's super talented a lot of his talent was a natural he had to work at it in and he's put the practice time in over the last\nWell gosh I guess almost Fifteen sixteen years that I've known him he's put the time in that to accomplish what he's accomplished their trout than it is unbelievable\nYeah I Know when mark fresh there I'm a beat him a couple of years ago there uh he really he really dug deep in a it was impressive to see and how hard he worked to win back to a championship\nYeah to think as good as he was back then that he could come back at different writer on a whole nother level and in one ear ... you know have one off season to to to themself up\nIt was crazy and then he was able to beat mark that year and you know when it's night the championship and then come back again this year for his tempting and he's already signed for next year\nA back with us again so you know there's a chance that he could he could break Jeff parents' record at ten and become an eleven time champion and and be the the goat\nAbsolutely we're we're we're certainly hoping restaurants will happen as well let's let's let's move ahead I Know we're we're probably going to be around for a number of quickly but I'm\nThe I'm
