anybody thinking about voting democratic\nI was at a banquet last night with a financial planner dinner and I talked to a man who had worked for forty years in the same company as a machinist he had worked thirty two to forty hours for the past eight years\nHe's not working seven days a week ten hours on the weekends and they can't keep up with orders I live up by Greenville and Jim town so Hodge

hearing all our President Trump and the first lady on meeting with wounded officers and medical staff of the Pittsburgh hospital after paying respect to the victims of Saturday's mass shooting president and first lady less stones from the White House and he started David outside the tree of life synagogue representing the eleven victims but not in\nIt's like a cleaner like stuff biodegradable that's a more harm the o rings and I clean that\nChain thoroughly when they very soft bristle brush so it's pretty shiny and then I put my bell re I like to use fell re chain loop on it okay and I put that ought to let it sets you know and so little and hear pretty good did that\nMake sure I changed my all so I don't know how many more times I'm going to ride the bike but want to make sure I have fresh role but I don't have any of those exhaust fumes\nWith the oil sitting around ... over the winter time right the other thing I always do is when I park that bike\nAs soon as I can I plug it in I plug it into my um bell rape or what does it del Rey battery tender gallery battery it right and I make sure that you know my battery tenders on and that things are looking good I also even though the bikes are in the garage it when I'm certain they're going to be put up\nThat's when I take the covers out and I absolutely cover my bikes in the winter\nIt's just something I've always done sometimes I'll put a little blanket over um and then put the cover over him but I make sure that I cover them up because you know that'll keep any moisture from getting on and freezing on getting off and all that and I just think it just saves you a lot of trouble in the long run that's what I like to do how 'bout you\nYeah I um I have a cover for my bike and uh I cover the ones in storage\nUh but the the one that die a take out late ... early I take it out late and I take it out early in the spring um I haven't covered that um I Do have another bike in the garage and it's kind of covered\nBut um yeah it would be able to both of you to do that because inside the garage I noticed a and I don't have a aged garage so I'll get moisture are a lot of times the tools will sweat\nOr a metal things in the garage or we'll wind up bus wedding Debbie damp or\nA new might even have a little water on him in the garage or I it's not a ... it doesn't leak or anything but\nWell how about this you are with me when we went on Sunday and by the way thank you Bob ... for an excellent oh what a ... a year we do we all get together the good old boy breakfast kind of thing and I mean I just live for that sausage gravy I mean it's it's a wholesome kind of you can have\nThat sort of like an oxymoron I Know some gravy but anyways a\nJust a fantastic a breakfast bomb but one of the things I did out there is a I I use Bob's compound\nAnd I kind of kid them about it because he's been so great but I started just about everything under the sun out there I got a mini bike I I don't have any more bikes I've so a lot of them but it's still have a bunch of parts laying around tools laying around\nAnd I also have a son fish sail boat out there so I feel the cover back with your help Roy Mm I\nSat inside a bag of charcoal and then I split it long ways and open it up and I'm sort of like using that as it what is it a desk that's good oh a absorbs\nMoisture joy absorbs moisture a lotta people do it in their campers mobile homes ah trailers and stuff like that\nOn one of the things I learned Saturday and it's similar to that but I did I managed to make the very last race of the year I managed to make the very first race of the air and then four months later I made the last race of the year at the A R C radio\nControlled sailboat races and these are big boats\nWell one of the guys as a national champion on airplanes\nFly in those ... like he's a three day pile on race or whatever so but he gave a seminar on how to maintain your equipment over the winter highly expensive electronic here I mean these guys get like ten grand in these turbo prop jets yeah [laughter]\nSo he brought out these little packages of desk desk and and it's like the they're like little blue beads\nAnd they're in packaging environment different size you just search for him on line right and he sets him inside his boat inside the planes especially inside the motor and the bag up the motor\nBut what happens is you showed us it will turn pink from absorbing the water and you can use those ... are again once you put them in the microwave and drive them out like that but you can get bigger back so I thought to myself\nWell you know what they way nothing put a little towel or something or on the seats are on the gas tank or over by the instrumentation or under the seat by the electrical wiring and sent one of those they're set one up there and make sure that way\nIf you have a heater grudge you don't need to do anything but when you have the ... temperature variants is that we're going to experience in next couple of months fry it might not be a bad idea I I think he got like fifty of 'em for ten bucks\nYet you don't put 'em in the microwave do they go in the oven is it in the ... but many of the yeah the microwave will look like the fourth of July when you turn it on\nA low areas the adults at\nMost of those canisters and like you say they come in and about three different sizes people use them in a gun cabinets to ... to keep the guns from rusting\nA in a house of course in the winter time usually in a house it isn't too bad because your furnace burns up the moisture in the air it is the oxygen in near to the new furnaces cake outside air in\nAnd it makes the flame or more efficient because it's got a lot of oxygen in it what you and your house or is a used up and the oxygen\nBut I'm your furnace when you run your furniture in the wintertime that takes a lot of moisture out of the air so you don't usually have a problem with moisture in the air so much at home now in the basement you could still have that\nUm because of the walls and the sides and so and so forth but the rest of the house is usually not too bad PR moisture in the wintertime because of the furnace drives that air out\nHere's something else I wanted to offer it to you as well and wondering what you thought about this your bike here one ear third bike that you haven't driven all year is sitting\nIn a a storage facility that is not heated correct and not electricity correct what if you bought a giant marine battery one of those big\nYeah I have a couple of those and then you hooked your battery tendered to that how long do you think that was last because if the batteries already charge all this thing's going to do is just maintain that a little bit you know yeah do you think it would last two months of the\nProblem is the battery gender uses a hundred and twenty bullets and the batteries are twelve votes when I got that solve for you so you can have a new burger and you could plug daddy and\nYeah we should talk about in murders and con murders and that but I have one and believe it or not I bought it from harbor afraid\nBecause we lost electricity\nI some pump wasn't pumping and I could see the water is getting high on my wife was standing right behind me going ... you had better do something sorry Whalen\nSee for a while but you know what I did I went and got one of those stupid little thirty dollar\nSyndromes or whatever they are it sounds like a vitamin and I plugged my some pump into that and then Iran jumper cables from my bad or that in Iran that thing literally for eight or nine hours it would cycle pumped by shut off to shut eye ... shut up eight hours\nAnd all yeah certainly and this thing's gonna never did and then I checked the charge because I had a ... meter on the battery and that's why I mentioned you that could last for quite a while and then if you get one of those\nLittle Mickey Mouse things that you have on your roof you know those little ones that are solar power and all yeah but then I don't know if that's screens big enough to can charge that battery I Am able to help\nIt would help uh\nYou could put that up what the owners are saying hey it's okay to just put a little screw and then run the cables down and during the day it's you've got light and you're charging it up and it might be a way of keeping a which that's a good test we ought to try and do\nI could do that 'cause I have a couple of different sizes panels I Am them anywhere from a three foot square to a briefcase sized and then I have a little one that's probably\nGoing to be in a bigger than that by a well a need those military does does\nThat we've seen that folded up right little brick when\nThey when you open 'em up there by four feet by four feet and those were good\nOr you don't have to use a whole lot to keep a battery maintained it isn't being used I mean what's in your bike is a ... when the keys out so long as your bike doesn't have a key starter key unlock\nWell the ... strain on that thing is going to be a clock\n[noise] probably\nSo that's why I disconnect one battery cable but in your bike you have to pull out the computer and all that so I don't know but\nThat might be something or disconnect the o'clock so I don't know how much it uses but our our bikes are older they're yours is brand new but the bike I have in the bike you have that's in storage yeah there're early nineties and I don't think that's old but by modern standards there are all you know\nYeah uh most of the time I Would say a panel a say a foot square panel would probably keep those batteries ah you know charged up a well we got we\nNeed to try that that might be an option for a lot of people\nWell there's a way to measure that we can measure how much juice that charger uses\nI just kept plugging along in what I enjoy doing it wasn't that I was making a living at it it's what I really enjoyed doing and I was just fortunate enough to make a living so\nYeah my last championship was two thousand\nNine I Believe she doesn't live in so we're right in there so\nYeah I guess I'm getting old and I forget what it's been pretty awesome and like I like you were saying about the you know now during the I guess they call it the ... the senior class thirty five plus and uh I'm forty six now but I still enjoy being out there and competing and uh\nMy son Cooper and I just got done doing photos and actually hadn't home now to a kind of start pack it up particularly\nWell it's been absolutely adjoining to watch Cooper ah ah I think it was a three years ago um we were in Daytona and Cooper Clinton battled for the amateur William and it was a sight to see Clinton was actually leading into the final laugh when a fell down in a\nA coup or ah took over and then a nobody wants to prevent and I I got a thriller shall amplifying problems 'cause that was his first main event that he made that night so I remember that stuff and I'm watching you guys marching Cooper\nWhen they're and coupon quitting or on the podium at the same time enough watching you guys now you know it's really under across in everything you've helped\nUs wealth and being able to hang with you guys in the in some you take a Clinton stuff around and it's been a real honor and I'll just tell us a little bit about girl cross and and and and what's the future\nReal Cooper's Arizona will go into the the the honesty is getting ready to go to ... and kind of wrap things up and and we want you to tell us a little bit about the training\nYeah no I was like you were talking about indoor requirement and they crossed with your son Quinn and stuff and you don't want to do across is it's probably one of the most exciting to wheel race and you can see it's indoor it's basically extreme off road writing inside of the stadium we have logs rocks water job\nYou know guys that are jumping bagel logs to another log in a ... a ... acre those guys are just amazing\nSpecimen specimen to watch because they're just add another level and it's been an ex game I think eight nine ... now it's a it's a blast to watch how far its came and pretty much a this weekend is our last event for the year in Boise and almost every round we've gone to it's been a sellout so all of the stadiums have been\nJust sold out and it's the most unpredictable racing because\nThere's so many obstacles and go down to be leading would laugh and then back to fit for the next five you're back to leading that's what makes it so excited and then uh yeah I Would definitely try to check those out and then getting getting to the highest the what you're talking about which is international six days and there are\nSome people do it is I asked the tea or ... years ago and stuff and it'll be might tempt prime and the reason I'm going again I didn't think I Would ever again but uh my son qualified on the U.S is\nAnd uh and I qualified also so I'm gonna be able to

going to be an honor you know they're representing the country again and stuff\nYou know at that level is it's tough to do and I don't I don't know if they don't expect to hire for the fact that I'm getting older and\nI stay more than my comfort zone than I used to in a in why don't get paid to raise ... we're living in your ATM still how my son and I are out the comic sided with that I'm looking
