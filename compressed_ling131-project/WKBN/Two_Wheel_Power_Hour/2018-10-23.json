race was covered in by the Washington field's reporter and it was quite simplistic in ways but if you're a few of the little fractions of it for instance about motor cycling in March twenty six and Ninety nine [noise] the city has a considerable number of enthusiastic\nMotor cyclists and they have taken steps to organize a club with miles in Warren motorcycle owners included race meets or

S. T. A. fall colors or M. S. T. A. Marietta over to West Virginia and hold on and oh boy mhm uh it was actually a a decent pace\nSome really good roads or some of it freaked me out because they had paved roads\nAnd there was no edge line and you know how they put tar down before they put the actual blacktop on it right they tarred about a foot from the edge of the road over into the ... the whole thing and it was shiny and the sun was shining would glint off and it just was spoke to me a couple of times you know\nBut I had a pretty good time it was a great ride with Steve ... are certainly a a veteran leader of a a lot of events and that and uh I had a good time so uh one of the things that I noted is\nThat there's three faces to riding right now as far as clothing\nYou know that when you first go out in the morning you're going to be bundled up you're going to be the marshmallow man you have and whether that means that you've got a jak liner and an online or in your over pants\nOr that means that you're wearing your electric electric jacket and then you're falling jacket over top of that wearing a back a lava is always a great thing I I find that to be the best\nFor keep my head warm and that and then a course you know we've got those winter gloves I wore those Gore Tex clubs I bought up into BMW shop\nAnd they were okay but they're not going to be good for anything that's a thirty some no metal yeah if I can find my other gloves that'd be good then I'd be okay and I have electric car gloves and of course I haven't broken out that electric chair of the last time I think I was when you and I\nAnd a group took off for Daytona and it was the very last week like the twenty seven twenty eight the February and that's when\nDaytona was the very first week of march back then ... back back in the day right and that's when we had to wait during the week look for an open but ... now I can remember\nLater when it was twenty seven out and there was snow banks but no snow on the pavement payment was dry yeah we've ... we've had times when I was a foot deep up here and we had a trailer part way yeah yeah um\nNow that three three things so you know you're going to address ... you're going to layer up in the morning but by the time you get around noon or one you're going to probably taken some of that stuff off court at the very least like I did it change gloves and opened up a ... to ... kept all the gear on\nAnd then as if you're out all day as you start to come back in the sun starts adept yup that's when you you're going right back to where you were in its chuckle when I pull and they say you know I began looking like this and I am looking like this [laughter] yeah\nThat's kind of the way it is a for fall riding especially when you leave early in the morning I Know the last couple of Sunday's it's been in the thirties well it's pretty chilly ... get out of the meeting or whatever uh then you don't need to get heated gear or you know at ten or eleven o'clock it's not so bad\n[noise] [noise] well I Know that you're going to talk about in touch upon some things but one of the things I'll mentioned briefly as that are\nNow because especially in the mornings when it is in the thirties and you have an excellent chance almost a hundred percent chance of getting frost on something\nWhen we're traveling and we try and go through twist these which are mostly tree lined or what not you know I dread going and leading the bike over because I Know once I get in the shadows\nThings get loose yeah and I don't want to hit a leaf I sure don't want to hit that yellow line or any of the paid in lives cause you slide all over the one thing you don't slide on conversely this tar snakes\nWhen they're hot there slippery and when the cold I don't find them to be\nThat is correct you they they supply you grip or\nSo to speak in the wintertime you don't lose it like you do in the summertime but a dose shady areas on the road that early in the ... like a day can be crossed in or it can be there and kill the sun comes up high enough that it comes over the top of the trees in it melts at a frost well\nI'm sure we're going to hear more about it and your segment
