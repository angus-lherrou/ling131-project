Bronx that's one good place to check down there in uh south Canfield reason being it has to extend it I have a wood burner in my workshop in my garage haven't used it in a while\nIt has to be so many feet away from ah the side of the house it has to be so many feet above the highest point is they've just mentioned to me but above the peak\nTo have a draw if you don't have it extended up past that it ain't gonna draw because there's no air convection no matter what size you know pay people to him because of the majority of the paper six to eight inches double wall you know as they go through the you know the ... or whatever six exposed\nAnd you may have some constriction in it so you're going to in fact you can do research on the Internet but you're going to possibly have to add pipe ... pipe on to that uh you know flu that you got there to get it to draw properly because it should do it you shouldn't have that\nYou know push back down through the same thing goes with sewer pipes are we've got one down at the lumber yard where the stack pipe was only\nA a like two to three feet above the flat roof but it was close to another portion of the building we don't get that draw so would I had to do is I added a six foot piece of PVC pipe onto the top of that I put a draft induce or motor on that\nI put a a a cap on the top of them that's what's the water doesn't go down through there we flip a switch it pulls the sewer gas cars in the wintertime with the air being held at\nIt Bush's everything back down into the building and it gets pretty stinky and there I put up with wood burning smell versus what we got sewer gas but that's what you're going to have to do and you're gonna have to research that\nAnd get it up high enough so that it does the draw on that\nIf I Can't lay it down to Cambodia no you know any other contract\n... you\nYou could check with Youngstown propane because they they do fire places a Scott out there and Mike out there ah in ah boardman Canfield

American concrete home care show a law will run and gun is going to have on November ninth they're they're fantastic fish fry so if you're in the neighborhood Louisville rod and gun is up to twenty four\nAnd a towards a hills ville\nTowards the Newcastle there towards that area and uh that's going to be the ninth and my buddy Larry ... who um you know who comes into the lumber yard posted a sign and I did not\nRead everything off the sign so I think it's may start at noon but you can always give logo riding gun a call and find out but it's always it's always a great fish fry I think when Larry has done their own Corey road sixty two twenty five or erode in ...\nAnd ah if you want to contact them you can give a call at three three o\nFive three six eight one for three and Larry says after I get done with the fish ... got to go home and burn my clothes sizes was full of fish\nBut it's always a great great event um lady that called in last week after the show closed down a she has a lamp post and I answered your question and I happen to be in one of the big box stores I was looking for some electrical things over the week that I didn't have that at the yard\nAnd she said her photo cell in her lamp post burned out and do I have to she said do I have to buy the whole head being the the whole fixture with the light in it and uh the glass and all of that and no you don't they're sold separately they're easy to an ...\nPaul now she isn't going to do it but if she gets somebody out there\nAnd uh you pull the head off and then of the lamppost down inside and the pipe and a three three and a half inch pipe there is a little black rectangular boxes that has a screw embezzle on the face of the photo cell\nAnd that an screws and then you can put to get the new one the new one I think was eight to ten dollars somewhere in that range um\nAnd you just look at the wires if it's red white or black why or why why are you just take one way or off at a time and\nThen reconnect the red wired to read where the black ... black choir and the white where to the white where you've got to make sure that the power is shut it off to the unit\nUm that's the critical point that you have to make sure that uh there's no electricity running in while you're making that change if there is a switch inside the house to controls that you can shut that switch down and you can also you know tested\nUm a lot of guys are not afraid and they'll they'll wired live you know they'll one way or at a time and be very careful not to our comer\nTouch 'em together but I don't advise that uh if there's a switch inside the house you got to make sure that that's the hotline that's going out there that's that's broken or you shut the breaker off if you can figure out which one that is too if you break your panel is labeled\nSo that just tough as it gets to photo cells are inexpensive are easy to replace and or somebody with some mechanical knowledge not necessarily electrical knowledge\nRed the red black to black white the white and uh you know and follow the instructions but that should help her out also Tom called in and he had a a hit or ... or something of that nature that had a poly you know the identity polyethylene gas tank on it\nAnd he said that the whole in there where the hose went through it was too large\nAnd he had ... or the rings it out or gotten too large and I told him to call my critic and making I happen to sit down and have lunch on Tuesday\nAnd I had mentioned that to him and told Tom that if he couldn't get the whole to fit around the rubber where where it was leaking or that he probably have to get a new tank and that's what Mike was suggesting also but I told them\nThat if you get J. B. weld and you've got to clean the tank out the the gas tank you may have to remove it from the ... or whatever the device was\nAnd then um\nYou fill the whole up with J. B. weld and the lead it's a mushroom out into the inside of the tank and mushroom up to the outside of the tank\nThen you can read drill that to the exact size of your gas line that you're trying to fish through there and that should make a tight enough sitting around that gas line\nThat uh it should not leak it would be the same as having the polyethylene sitting tight around it the other thing is to ah they do make rubber growing much you can find those at the electronic store but Mike and I were talking\nAnd saying that if the ... is not a gas resistant petroleum resistant than it will get real stretch in and kind of soft and punky over a few years\nBut it may get them through a season and if he buys a half a dozen ... may last them a lifetime so that's another quick fix for a a weed ... that may have a\nI guess my problem with the whole two large in the tank or we're going to go to Jay are good morning chair how can we help you\nSay you're a member no not really years it was this guy it was on the local TV news I think he lived in West side of Youngstown, Ohio\nI figured out how to get his water free here's how he did it he started off and put four by eight you know grab all behind his house right then he'd put four\nFifty five gallon drums yeah yeah and and he put a little unfair on that so it wouldn't look on slightly right yeah they connected those drums to the gutters ring a bell\nLittle things behind bushes in places and nooks and crannies around your property you might want him to put in a motion detector security like she'll give Steve ... call it's inexpensive to protect your\nProperty you don't have to lighted up twenty four seven moon's shadow landscape lighting three three o five six five four six five three uh all kinds of great lighting fixtures Eli these incandescents a to compact fluorescents even though they're going their way out a Mr Edison is probably rolling and\nTossing and turning in his grave but you know what ... the way to go there's so many varieties of them out there give Steve ... call three three o five six five four six five three little light up your life\nOkay uh\nWe're going to take care of Denny and uh and David so hang hang on the line you know um there was an article in the Ohio a state extension was on\nA Thursday and the poor poor bug repellent so they were talking with trap or used to talk about Osage orange\nAnd there was an article in one call 'em there but talked about the Osage orange ended in high concentrations of the juice or whatever comes out of them\nIt can be a a bug in spider repellent but they said for the most part part and and you know trapper I Apologize and I don't want to be ... reputation but it's it says it is relatively ineffective unless you use a concentrated amount of\nWhatever comes out of those Osage oranges um but uh\nIt was nice well west as you know trapper was a great guy and ah we still have great memories of\nOkay ... let's go talk\nTo David good morning David how can we help you this morning [noise] hang on David we're going to put you on hold we'll be right back after these messages on five Seventy WKBD in home care\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] were given a proud of them coming from Iraq from all around the corner [noise]\nHorrible proper her party [noise]\n\nWas having a shirtless mad yelling at the roadway led Struthers police to thirty five year old Michael ... who\nPolice say said his parents had a pet dog Pearl were possessed and he killed the pet police searched the home where he lived on Alina drive\nThey found mutilated animals in his room and the remains of the family pet Pearl in a trash can neighbors have called the cops on hello Kim multiple times\nHe's into my own in county jail investigators say they have some leads in a case where a mother and her son were found shot dead at a Youngstown home police say the homicides are related to the victims lifestyle choices\nHaley ... lord we're both found dead in a home in the Twenty one hundred block of summer street\nYesterday morning Y.

this morning good thanks good list that\nI put in a new thing in a faucet in my whole thing and it was like this\nJob I've ever done I don't know how it happened but\nWhen I turn on the hot or cold and I think sometimes it all like push like it'll help like when I turned the handles\nOn ... air in there but I think because of player that's\nIt's a possibility there's a divert are in there and that may be plunging in and out ah it it shouldn't 'cause it should only Paul said when you use that sprayer\nA is when it should Paul said so that may be hanging up on there or the pressure may may hit it and then it it may cycle but that would be the only thing that I could think of since you say that there is a sprayer on there and there is a diverted what brand for citizen\nOh I don't know the exact name of it\nAre the look that look that up because if it's if it's a mowing or adult or appear lists\nUm any one of those you can call them they do have some really good help hotlines end of the folks normally on those you know on those phones\nAre pretty good about solving them or go on line and ah there's a site to a couple of sites that will answer questions for you without charging you for it but the or the district the um whoever you you know whoever\nManufactured that should be able to give you some advice on that but again that's the only thing I can think that what Paul said in there and give you that slump or that or you know ...\nMore or less yeah uh because if you if you have you taken the uh the fuse are off you know the offer an you know when you put it on a ticking off the screen on the end of the faucet okay\nTake that off and let that what that water run and clean out that you know in case any debris you know settlement has come up from the old pipes when you you know took them apart and put it altogether take they take that ah you know screen off\nAnd let the water run and look at that and see if there's some settlement in there then you're going to be sure that Ninety nine percent of the air is out of that system and then also use your sprayer because that may be clogged up to hopefully not but right try both of those and that may solve the problem in the short run right\nYes thank you very much for your health All right thanks for calling a we had a fellow come in\nYesterday and he was explaining to me and he brought in on a piece of paper the
