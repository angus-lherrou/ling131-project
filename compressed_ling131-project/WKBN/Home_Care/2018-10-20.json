a\nSomewhat of a mushroom aficionados and that was happened to be in the ... on Thursday about mushrooms and it described it but I must have left that back at the ranch\nOr natural gas prices are all over the board\nUh to to do to do\nThere is a company in one of our listeners are not the lumber yard and he mentioned Santana S. A. N. T. A. N. N. A. and he said the gas from Santana when he signed up for it was around two Ninety One somewhere in that range per thousand cubic feet\nI Googled it and I found it at three Nineteen on that same now that was for six months\nUm then ah twelve months was three twenty nine which is still not a bad price I signed up for the lumber yard and a bunch of other buildings\nAt about three thirty one per thousand and which is not horrible I mean it was better than last year but uh there's just um\nYou know there's just all kinds of things you can find on the Internet for apples to apples PUC oh a and that will give you some gas prices and I'm not going to see your ... almost too late because there still are they're saying that the gas supply you listen to two different you know stations in one says there's a plethora of gas\nAll around and then there's another one sister is a little bit of a shortage because or whatever and and who knows who's telling the truth should go on to the PUC oh in kind of Google it and see where the gas levels out to be going to go right to the phone and talk to Iran good morning Ron How can we help you this morning\nI hear your situation our toilets or will it will it will fill up stop and then\nAbout two hours later run for like checkers and quit and then two or three hours later it'll run for ten seconds and then I mean not in the middle of the night I could hear\nWell ... you know I I Know no mine's mine's my stories better than your story ... okay then let's say let's have a story on our mind\nAll right this was an ad Gracie story at Gracie uh she was up in years and then I went over to the house to to hang a door for her on on a room in the house\nAnd she said her while you're here can you go look at the two toilets and I went in there and they had they had to read ... in their ... and if you're familiar being you'd a plumber supplement or you know what a red ... red cork is a is an after market flapper\nRight Korean resistant at that the red ones in the chlorine resistance ...\nAnd they make them adjustable so that if you missed the whole some of them depending on they have a whole line of yup flat bridge\nSo I flipped a little over on the toilet because it's an American standard it gives me a data gives me an model number and everything so I call my buddy they've done it Trumbull supply\nAnd I said David Was a plea da da da da da da da da de ... got ... I should have two of them set aside for me and and I took them back and I installed them because it was doing the same thing that ... was doing it would snow in back and forth\nYou buy an original equipment O. E. M. original equipment manufactured flapper in it because they've engineered it for that toilet and again the after markets lepers may work and may not work\nAnd ... did not\nGet stopped her problem and she quit losing water now what I did in my house because my toilets go back to Nineteen fifty and they have the American standard timing bucket on it which is like a cylinder on the back of the flapper those I won't say that they're they're obsolete you can still get them\nBut I put the fluid master a flush your fixture on there because it's got a timing bucket on it which you may or may not need but it's got the uh seat where you clean off the flush felt area in your toilet\nIt's got gum in there which is a really is it's um duck seal electrician Jews\nAnd clean it off real well and you and your dry it and make sure it's real dry and then you re installed that Bulger and I've had them in the house for thirty some years now yeah and they were not Ryan what what's your suggestion well her\nFirst thing I Would do is ask Ron have you ever taken the lead of the toilet off and looked inside of their\nOkay [noise] yeah have you don't have you have you done that yet\n... American standard American standard coated with original equipment and however it is probably twenty five\nYears they get my she yeah and they lose their seal yeah usually if you if you reach\nYour hand on the inside of the tank now I'm not selling any of the customers reach their hand inside of the ... the ball down the other thing that that things all clean on its dirty [laughter] you know they're taking all clean of you but if you raise your hand inside\nOf there and you feel that flapper and then you hold your hand out in your hand gets a little bit black your fingers get like a little bit of that rubber on there then we know that that that needs to be to be replaced the flapping airplanes that spring\nBreak is\nCorrect so now we've had that same thing happened I'm\nIn New installs or not new in cells but new rebuilds before the guys I'm you know before my service experts knew better and toilet is in the plumbing world toilets are probably the biggest source of call backs that you have to go to a call backs being\nI'm a freebie because you know something wasn't done\nQuite right the toilets are the biggest pain for all farmers in in the world but the there's an assist toes\nThat comes off of the ... the film vowels and that is just as yeah so that assistance if that if this has this push down inside of the tube too much I think there should be an air got but if it's pushed down inside of the two but it's called an assist too\nBut if it's inside of the assist to too much it will slowly safe and water out of the tank put it into the bowl then once it siphons out enough of that water you'll hear [noise] and then they'll fill up\nFor about ten seconds and then you know and they'll stop filling and then about an hour or two later\nWhich leads to my next story [laughter] mother\nAnd to top it off the filler to pitch wish she was just interested in the middle so I straighten up a shame that I was wondering if that would have been a problem\nYeah did you get when you straighten it up or do you have a going into that assist tube that I\nFeel around three quarter inch plastic\nPerhaps a little bit holds it on there\nYou're you're up above the the siphon line\nYou as long as that too but as terminating above the water level in the tank you should be OK\nOkay that makes sense\nYeah so if it's going inside of the assist to too far it'll just continue safe from one another sometimes where I've seen some of the old box that fail hum with aids\nAnd they'll allow a water to drop out if the arc is a little bit too um prominent it you know a at a downward angle so I'd see water sometimes trickling out there\nBut I mean it sounds like the first thing is the flapper so it's really just two things either flapper and when you do change their flapper whether its original equipment or whether it's a quirky which we we probably quite honestly by about\nFive to seven hundred ...\nA year ...\nWe don't have I mean we don't have any issues with them but we're good about cleaning off the seat because if you don't clean off the seat it doesn't matter if it's original equipment or if it's a quirky flapper you'll be going back there and when you clean the seat off you know I usually have my guys take a piece of plumbers cloth plumber stand in class\nAnd they just lightly sand the seat all the way around um I've done it before with my thumb now just to see if there's any uh imperfections and the seat because if there's any imperfections and the seat the flapper won't make up the difference a lot of times you know you'll you'll have\nA an issue and you know once you do change the flapper whether it's you know I'm you know American standard or quirky went once you change a flat bring it to seek cleaned off it's a good measure um now hardware stores I think uh I Would imagine even um\nYou know to cut the wouldn't stops out and then he wanted to obscure the reason the window broke he was trying to put an obscure\nUm frosting on it with us we're called Mac tech or it's like a contact paper on the basement window so that you know people couldn't look and he had a shower down the basement or something of that nature and\nThat's what he wanted to do to that window but ah it can be somewhat labor intensive but if you're fairly handy a lot of folks out there can fix it themselves or two weeks ago we had a ... was wasn't a ... a\nPrice Fisher I had it written down but he had a problem with it and he wasn't getting much um you know volume out of the kitchen faucet mhm so we said if you disconnected down below on the because I don't know if it was hot and cold and he'd taken off the diffuse are up from the you know you know on the top and still wasn't getting what\nBut if you're flow was okay when it's coming up to the faucet\nThen it could be the divert or in the faucet if you've got a you know sprayed\nYet Alvin ... biggest yeah on a chateau faucet that Ninety two ten I think is a model and diverted goes bad\nYeah and in those forces are normally guaranteed for life I mean they they jump through hoops when you call them on the phone and said yeah ... yeah ... do you want a new Washington ... delta did that to me I should note the one that I have this kind of space age looking it's got a high filler on it\nAt the ... the force it I mean I didn't pay six hundred bucks for it but the forces are six hundred dollars and yeah and she said we'll send you a new force it I said I Want the cartridges well you know that such and such has been discontinued ...\nSend me the cartridge the hot and cold and I said I'll be fine I'm not crawling underneath the counter and taken this force it out and it's not going to be what\nWas in you know and so you know it's just [noise] but they are willing to bend over

over there and the Youngstown area uh-huh ah I'm over here in uh eastern Butler County da ... and uh we're paying like highest rate in the state over here it's like night\nAnd then the yeah for residential I just wonder what your title a residential rate is over they're\nNineteen fifty Bertha that's Nineteen dollars and fifty cents\nR. and fear that the total I think the gas it\nFell are charging effect ... well eighty five three dollars at the wellhead they call it and then like outlet okay yeah All right and then they add a translation chart\nOkay All right we have it and they start\nHim on a you know it would be ... I guess what what uh what is yours over in that area roughly\nThe transmission feed there isn't much you can do about that but you're the price you you're paying for gas yes that that fluctuates and and I have a card in my hand here that was three dollars and Seventeen cents per thousand and you're saying you're too to Ninety something\nWell it it somewhere between ... lady five and three dollars that well had\nA lighter double it you know but I'm Wondering about your how much is your total bill what is your translation charge in that area over there\nAnd that varies yeah so in the various ... a month to month it can be ... again it's so much for you know per cubic foot and I don't have my bill in front of me at the moment um but\nYou know that's why I say you try to bargain 'cause you can't do anything about transmission I mean they're going to ... you can't find another transmission company as far as I Know to bring the gas in to the house or the ... the business or cetera\nBut calling a natural monopoly on me now to where it is completely I mean we're\nNot on a ship like yeah we're surrounded by wells and not the actual price of gas that might affect their if it's the highest rate of pay higher than it's ever fan and that's where all the magic ... translates\nThe there's no law now on how you like it would cost ... through the line\nWell I like to go\nIn what they want they did years ago in in in Ohio well here's two there's three on one of ... three ... three dollars and thirty four for per thousand and then the other one was a was an odd company here there was three Seventeen that was Ohio called a company called Ohio natural gas\nThe uh the PUC oh public utilities commission allowed the gas companies\nTo increase that transmission fee a few years back and the reason they did that is and we talked about it a couple of weeks ago that they were replacing gas lines\nAnd they're replacing them all over Ohio here and I imagine they're doing it in Pennsylvania also\nUh they said that they needed so many billions of dollars to run to redo the infrastructure of those methane gas lines and also the ones to the house now it goes back Fifteen Years or better\nOr they charged me I think seven hundred and fifty dollars to replace the gas line from the devil strip or from the street determination valve out there\nInto my house I paid for that now when we talk to the gas company just recently they said well we own that line now you don't have to pay ... a you know we're going to run lines into homes the new plastic lines and put the new meters and so\nYou know we we can talk for hours yeah on gas especially with that because we used to do all those gas lines who I used to do we used to be that contractor they went out and then them from the house the street but\nThen they have such a bad problem with leaks and um the steel line so dumb Indian has an an initiative to get rid of all of the steel lines and teens or in a plastic by like twenty twenty five\nOr ... and they took that responsibility away from the homeowner specifically for that reason because of the fees that they were having to charge and they wrapped it into that delivery fee that direct the jurors are asking about I'm not going to say complaining they are asking them by and not", "show_name": "Home Care", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "20"}
