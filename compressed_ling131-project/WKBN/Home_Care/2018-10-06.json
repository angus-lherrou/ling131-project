clean up the garage queen out of a corner of the basement before we closed down for winter that might be a practical thing to do today so uh you know give it a shot and see if you can get rid of some stuff around the house\nUh and you make somebody happy either your hobby or your wife one of the two we're going to go right to the livestock to Tim good morning Jim how can we help you this morning\nOr good morning my question for you and I said yes yes\nIt any more conclusions specially gator there on that gas line up in Massachusetts and if you have any fear\nThat was one of the topics we were going to discuss yesterday so I'm Glad you brought that up first yes\nOkay are you are you an old time Youngstown resident\n[noise] okay\nWell do you remember when McDonald burned Thanksgiving morning well same deal I'm In the old neighborhoods ah if you have a meter in your basement and it does not have a pancake regulator on it it's not going to if it's in the basement mine doesn't\nUm those systems were regulated\nUm by a extremely large regulator\nA that is in if you drive around Youngstown the old neighborhood you'll see these like little green buildings on a corner uh maybe four to six foot square and inside that is a regulator for the entire neighborhood\n[laughter] yeah\nMhm [noise] so um but predominately in the old neighborhoods they didn't have regulation at the house so they regulated for the entire neighborhood in McDonald that flooded and it froze so instead of being a step down pressure it went to line pressure\nAnd uh consequently we had lots of fires and I think there is like nine houses lost\nAnd uh it ruined all the gas valves a on all the furnaces that were in town\nI unfortunately he went to Disney World that morning or so I missed all the event but uh the the new product it's out there today if you have high efficiency furnaces\nThey have um the gas valves have regulation that\nThey can't open against an extremely high pressure like that so if the furnaces in the off mode and it gets hit with high pressure\nThe valve doesn't have the power to open against it however should that Val being the on position ... then there's nothing to stop that pressure from blowing through and that's what happened in McDonald is the stuff that was on\nUm or the old standing pilots stuff that was pretty ignorant didn't really know what was happening uh it opened up in flames you know rolled out the front end of the furnaces and the water ...\nAnd uh you know caused a lot of damage anything that was you know by it you know a lot of those furnaces in McDonalds slab homes and storage is in their next to the furnace so they had flammable ... uh the end result is the town burned\nUm fortunately being Thanksgiving morning a lot of folks were home making dinner getting ready to go somewhere and they were able to shut it off um\nBut they went to like four to five times pressure in that scenario\nNow what would happen with the gas oven or gas cooked up or something of that nature potentially would just flare up especially if it had a you know standing that what's right and that type of thing\nAnd and you know the problem you know natural gas methane uh we'll see you know if it's ignited or trying to ignite it will seek oxygen so it'll roll right out the front end of the furnace or it'll go wherever it needs to sustain combustion\nThat's why they have rollout flame sensors right most of the the the new effect the birth of showed me that on some of the old luck shares where these little buttons you know right and sensors were in these in these older in these well one of the more\nModern but see I see offers within the last twenty five thirty years yeah is had you\nKnow flame over temp sensors on them yeah a flame rollout sensors in all my furnaces today there's flame rollout sensors that are manual reset\nAnd uh you know in the event of an overheat scenario like that you get about two or three seconds and it's going to knock that the gas fell off line the uh\nYou know but it it the potential is that it will damage the equipment no damage the pressure regulator and the gas valve and you know if it just popped a over limit its manual reset but it fail safe to off\nUm you know the the beauty of natural gas\nIs you know they pump so much more captain into it that you'd run out of your house that have very low level a firm that rotten egg smell which is them or captain but natural gas only burns between five and Fifteen Percent solution so if it gets away from the ignition source\nUm and or if you get a very high concentration is not gonna light\nBut the problem is people that smelled gas [noise] uh you know they they may call the gas company or the fire department or whatever and they'll get told you know vacate the house turn off all their pilots yadda yadda yadda and then some people will go back in\nWell if the houses that twenty or thirty percent concentration\nYou could light matches and nothing's going to happen soon as you ventilate the house and they and it drops down into that five to Fifteen Percent solution the phone rings and you blow up someone hits a light switch you blow up\nAny ignition source so the fan motor starting on your furnace potential spark\nOn a non totally enclosed motor yeah right\nYeah and so people have this false sense of security that hey I did everything I I called the fire department and their common and it's all good and here in the house blows up yeah\nSo that that should answer your question but that I appreciate you mentioning that to him because that was one of the things we were going to definitely going to talk about this morning\nThat was their gas company stock and date or I mean\nI I I Would say so is it a a regulator some more failed and I've heard they've already set aside a extremely large sum of money to cover the law suits or whatever\nBut you know there was another issue in New York City where we burned down a a townhouse high rise here within the last year it was a hundred year old gasoline routed through\nWell if you look at your gas bills you see that our our meter service charge went from roughly four sixty eight to almost twenty five dollars\nAnd the public utility commission nationwide\nDetermined that all gas utilities shell replace all Ferris lines underground to something it won't rust\nAnd that I think the date set for that twenty twenty five and the utilities said well how are we going to pay for it and they said well we're going to raise your monthly rate but if you were again in the area last summer\nI'm going down honing avenue Austin Town area west side you know ... by a raccoon road you know the whole road was tour\nOf all they're doing that in Struthers now and Larry my

all hope like little little reminiscing on the phone yes\nStarted me thinking about when I used to live in smoky hollow it growing up in the late fifties sixties and uh now when you started talking about ... fell to fish stuff\nOh oh yeah well I'm not a I feel I'm taking that you're Jewish occasions [laughter] well\nI'm Italian and minds of the time when my mom was talking one time that she has to do some cleaning for some Jewish people down\nYeah it's like she was a young girl yeah and uh she met one of her a\nLady she used to claim for Mrs aronoff and she met with her one day and she said it it she said you never come back to finish it and I paid you she says\nMrs there enough the way my mother used to clean you could have enough my mother's floors\nOf this so you know so clay yeah yeah [laughter] and\nShe says Mrs there enough you probably should have paid me\nAnd uh because the way my mother cleaned and she didn't go back for some reason I don't know\nAnd um is is there enough was complaining that she didn't go back and finish the job and that but she was always throwing in oh now you have to do a T shirts and can you do this but my daughter and my mom for the same\nFor the same amount that sees that\nTo pay her you know yeah this is there enough I didn't come back but you probably should have ended up paying me\nMore you know I\nEven meet refund but where we still live lives on Adams\nStreet right on a right there um\nI don't know if you've ever gone to the end the art seems\nApt now everybody in this town that is is anybody has gotten to the envy are you are okay well\nWe live right off of walnut street there on Adams street yeah and my brother in fact he just he couldn't go\nHe couldn't my brother could live anywhere he wants believe me he doesn't live there because you have to yeah and he lives there in his home is still there I think there's only a couple of houses on the street\nAnd he's one of them and it is home there and it has it all fixed up and it's just beautiful inside and that's where he chooses to live you still living living the life and he's a retired teacher and he lives there he's not married yeah and so but it made me think because we used to do to uh\nThe the Greek Church there were a tally in but we used to go for the festival days\nThat this weekend is is a saint Nicholas a that is the festival this weekend today and tomorrow\nFor them for the Greek and again Youngstown is such an a and it it's not unique I mean you go to Toronto you go to Chicago you go to Pittsburgh there sections of Greek Italians are there's a you know a Jewish section in different towns and there's um you know there's also Indian and uh\nYou know Middle Eastern and it's just it you know we all can live together and it is it's a lot of fun in that area down there as you said I was just a melting pot of young starting out\nYou know her my mom people would hear her talk she could she tallying uh-huh but ah\nI tell you an American or American Italian whenever she could speak Yiddish is that I don't know if that's what you said ...\nWell that's a that's a German and and it's a combination in it and it's a fun language because there's so many different dialects and meanings for a lot of the different things the same thing with the Italian and the Greek uh it's just a really unique area uh\nWell she spoke Italian of course yeah 'cause she spoke to my grandparents but\nShe also spoke Slovak right and and people couldn't understand and they didn't know what she was well she was a [laughter] well we lived you know in in a Smokey hollow she spoke all these different languages so they weren't sure\nBut some of that came from the mill workers to see the mill workers we were all neighbors of each other and the ... workers were you know the United nations they were for that and you know you know some of them were tool and dye makers some of them work we're in we're labor's I mean and it was the whole gamut\nAnd it was it's really a Youngstown is an enjoyable place to live\nIt isn't it a beautiful place yeah I mean I I'm On the upper upper north side that Crandall park that's where I live yeah and\nI I Love it there
