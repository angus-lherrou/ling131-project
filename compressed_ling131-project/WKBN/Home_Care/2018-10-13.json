stream and whatnot [noise] yep\nSo that's even a but let us know how it comes out All right hey thank you guys OK okay thanks for calling okay we're going to go to Steven who's been patiently waiting good morning Steve and how can\nWe can hang on a ship ... thanks for taking my call thank you\nUm I have the highest Ninety One percent starting last winter the thermostat one set auto fires up and just just begins to blue sheet flank shut 'em at only ... seats for one to three seconds but when I put it on\nI put the thermostat on on the furnace runs fine no problem\nUm I've had the fires stick changed I had a technician out that knows the unit and he's tried a couple of things it just keeps reverting back to the auto setting shutting off as soon as he starts blowing\nAnd then it starts back up again consistently but once it gets up to temperature to blow heat it shuts down again\nIs that the auto setting you make reference to is that on the sand side where you have auto or on or is it on the burn aside the your thermostat has an auto toggle ... alcohol\nOn the heat when it's on heat and when it's on on it works fine on the thermostat on the thermostat set for auto and heat that's when it shuts off every time the heat blows\nAnd then immediately heats back up again\nAnd just as it starts to blow he'd claimed extinguish is\nAnd it cools off and as soon as it cools off enough the flame comes on heats up again gets blowout just as it spread it a blowout just starts to blow out the furnished shuts off against shuts off the flight\n... and so just to clarify if the than is in the armed possession\nFan isn't the on position\nIt's rather than than it works out fine okay how old furnaces\nTwenty three years wow we got a bad heated exchanges oh okay so here\nHere's my thought on it or it's if uh if you get someone good that has the combustion analyze or uh you got to call them and say you\nCan wash Daniel was or you can bring with you the winner furnaces white you typically get\nDirty can last for a little bit of time and um\nIf you have a good ... you know as we can see what your carbon monoxide you're oh two and you're a C. O. two outputs are ah if there is a breach or a Cracker Barrel or something in the heat exchange or soon as a fan terms on you actually get a clean burn\nBecause it is pressure rising the heat exchange or with fresh oxygen ate at air so ... what\nHappens is you have a cleaner burning a I I presume that quite possible when you have cracks in the heat exchange here and it has the heat exchange or starts to warm up the heat exchange or opens up and then if the ban times on\nIt can actually put back pressure into the heat exchange here and cause a distortion in the butterfly him was hitting the flame sensor\nSo um the the ... product those were clam shells exchanges that Ron I'm formed in a certain team many of them and they were a attached partway up\nWith this little town a button and read it so on one side they punch a hole in about a half inch diameter raised a half inch and then the other side they drove a dies through it and it forwarded the metal back onto itself like rather\nA we have had many many many problems with every design that use that and then use that ... that the ... product you is that a calorie used it\nIn over time especially if the furnaces oversized or you've had inadequate Airflow you get too much expansion\nContraction the exchange or in a way pop that kind of live it off\nAs soon as the heat exchange you're starting to gain temperature it opens up and then it can allow\nBypass air from the border to come into the heat exchange or and change the parameters of how it's working so that air pressure can actually cause the safety switched to trip on the pressure on the matter\nAnd that's what's happening to safety switches tripping right\nSo that basically what you told me as you got bad heat exchange or time time to change it time for\nIt so it's not just a matter of changing the heat exchange\nOr well out of a new set of Twenty one years old it ain't got a war without a warning [laughter] I'll I'll tell you straight up or I had a eighty percent one acts uh I was gonna work for a my cap the among extract the action program and the furnaces in warning\nThe mother board in there is worse to arms and at least half a leg\nAnd I had a similar problem with one of my products a of a different brands source and ah they the industry as a whole I Will tell you had some issues with that\nBut uh consequently all my systems I put out there that are of that type of technology we put surge pressures on them\nA which is you know a hundred dollar item installed probably you know if they're out there\nAnd I think it's well worth it because all my mini splits the food to products on her drive\nAnd the the issue in in those things is that compressor you know normally we would have a thirty four fifty are rpm compressor in it the compressors and they're the scroll Copeland compressors can run out the sixty seven hundred rpm so they are humming when they get up\nYou know really a it is I've heard it they are they oh yeah they\nThey ... they can like you can hear 'em but the thermostat generally they have a setting you can clamp the speed of the compressor\nUh and and walk it out so it doesn't go to school if the noise as an issue but I'll tell you that more often than not it can come down to an air flow issue on the inside if you don't have adequate Airflow it is going to cause that compressor or to have a real bad life\nAbout tell you what Rick let's hang on for two seconds we'll be right back after this break and then we're going to try to solve this problem on the air on five Seventy WKBD and so stay tuned and we'll be right back\nOn home care by American concrete [noise]\nConvicted murderer Jacob ...

E. B. valve on their units they use regular T. X. the valves so all the logic up you've got all that Rick\nUh all the time\nYeah all the logic really goes between the thermostat in the outdoor unit\nUm and that high ANP draw it showing us over current\nIt to me the those things a lot of the first thing I'm going to look at is the Airflow on the system that you have adequate filtration you have adequate return air and duct work for the size of the equipment that was installed\nA you know we used to say four hundred see a ... ton between three fifty and four fifty a lot of the heat pumps systems would prefer the four fifty in the wintertime a yet cooling they're probably a little happier at three fifty for better treatment of vacation so you ...\nReally should get back\nWith your dealer and if you're not happy with them or for some reason the a distributor is based in Cleveland\nI'm up rock side road area independence and they have technicians that they can send out to assist your dealers\nI'm In diagnostic codes that product but you know and as much of what you paid for that because that is state of the art product a you shouldn't be getting these aircraft\nIt if we like to eat it for about the first year and then we've had nothing but headaches ever since we've been get eighty eight degrees an eye on one day\nYeah there is you you absolutely need to get back to your dealer and uh I hold their feet to the fire or should I say\nBut there is people there there is yeah there are people [laughter] in the area that they can in list to come out and help them in diagnostics\nAnd what and what Bob is saying is that it just like your car dealer you know when you're out there and then you're you're got a problem with your car they bring in the division chief to take care of it that's what he's telling you to do from up there on rocks I wrote in to get to do it now before it gets too much further down the road\nBecause you know in in the brand I I sell a I had some problems on a Seventeen years or three speed pump and uh they are now on their third outdoor unit and second indoor unit\nAnd my manufacture would at the bill every single time and because they want the\nProduct right and you know my product as I think the product you had has a ten year no lemon guarantee 'em meaning that if you lose a compressor they give you a whole new outdoor unit\nSo that's why I say it's it behooves you to jump on this thing like right now before the heating and really comes in the in the swing so that this thing is ready for you in the next ah six to eight weeks right yeah\nRefrigerated storage should also be a problem\nIf you heard it on the rpm on the compressor like you were saying to the cause I Know what you're speaking up would that help possibly slow down the lockout occurrences", "show_name": "Home Care", "year": "2018", "city": "Youngstown", "day": "13"}
