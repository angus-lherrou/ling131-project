and if they didn't have at least ... percent for that board equipment and\nUm it's a very strange place to be in because not all companies are the same and the oil companies are able to do\nTo that situation any time soon and side we need to have a great concern\nThat we're talking about legislation rather than ... either ... or more gender balance on board critical we do get gender balance over time but they're on the second is like seven companies like something that the longer to get that and set in the areas where there are less women maybe so actually qualified to take on that role\nIn certain sectors but I said to me to say that we should stop that was encouraged people to get on with that but I don't think legislation it's a way to go at this point in time I think it probably send the right\nSignal a new or dead that we actually get precious said that down the organization the only place because they can make a difference at this point in time they thought that I taught and

helpful way we can actually get that but we could look at different\nSchools that people that we don't look to the usual suspects so that she says the position and actually the more that the cool so we find talented women no matter where they might be\n... and the question of quotas I must say that um it's a controversial ones because I've been out there trying to make progress\nAnd especially in the financial services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress little bit now more than most recently but that having been said I think that um if you force\nThe issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation and so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think we need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is not true because if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith a perception that they're find sequences on the back and you know I think the excuses for inaction\nRunning so it's really incumbent upon us too I think with that little bit of pressure keeping the spotlight on the issue\nIs a type of thing that hopefully in that light light people feel that the needs a new and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation just a little bit you get to a tipping point and then it becomes

actually encouraged or the Senate to hear Dr Ford testimony in the same way he encourage them to hear a judge Kavanaugh says he is simply stating the fact\nThat we are a country of law and order we are a country that still believe that you're innocent until proven guilty only want to see that process I go through in its entirety and it should be on a fair playing\nField I simply the only time like the cars are finally feel the heat in the field that now back in the specific comment day but that's\nEnemy because if the president has taken this Sunday or president has taken this moment to say that he's not affected\nBy all of these allegations and he's picking and choosing just as the question was do that because well five ... five of guilty and he has made Bill Clinton's\nHe decided to change his mind on this this will cock fighting because they didn't sound interesting that\nYou bring up Bill Clinton nobody wants to hear those accusers voices be heard but you're certainly happy to hear all the other day they\nRest is I don't have any way shape or don't want it to them\nServe several times in the last week the president has tried to reassure voters\nPeople with preexisting conditions from\nIs that a sign that he's worried Republicans are the argument on health care in this election\nI think it's a sign that the president wants to protect people with preexisting health conditions I think it's pretty simple he said that he supports that and he wants to make sure that that's not something that gets girls' gym\nActors is a\nTime when it was pretty obvious the president was marketing Christian laws before last night and he says the how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember\nWhere is this place I don't remember\nHe seemed to be to the delight of the crowd there in Mississippi mocking her repeatedly\nIsn't there something wrong with the president of the United states mocking somebody who says she was sexually assaulted seemed\nTo me that he was dating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again a\nEvery single word that judge Kavanaugh\nHas said has been looked at examined picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at ah whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them every person that she names I had come out and said either they didn't call it or didn't happen or they weren't there\nEvery single bit of evidence and facts that we've seen in this moment\n... supportive judge Kavanaugh's case and the president simply pointed out the facts of the matter and that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not or\nSenate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not\nOr on your show\nI think both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nA or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploit of this process they exploit a doctor for their exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusations this isn't the process it should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh and that should be part of this process and the facts have to be looked at\nAnd I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nThose are where are you see all of those facts laid out and I think she makes a very compelling\nTrade show for it but I don't have any problem stating facts know John ... then you probably do have a\nBecause when you don't see the stars shine\nBut you're going\nThe most of it was very different\nRally audience\nWhy would change\nThe president's job believe we should vote fraud that she was very credible\nAddressed is the number of times I'm the president also said she had a very compelling\nStory and nobody disagree on end and nobody nobody disagrees with that but the president simply stating the fact that she laid out in her own testimony and that the prosecutor laid out in her memo at the end of the day that shouldn't have to make a decision on where they stand\nTo pick one I Want to\nFrom Italy that judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed he has a lot of confidence in him and he'd like to see a boat see that happen we\nTo make the credibility of a plane with how much time has\nThe individual need\nAlso causes activities scandal in the\nThe president seems to\nClaiming as he is the way to come\nThat's just completely untrue the president\nHas supported again ah throughout this entire process Dr forge\nAbility to come forward and tell her story he's the one that order the FBI to do a\nFurther supplemental background check\nI should look into each of the accusations and allegations that the Senate deems a necessary before making a vote um he's also um been more than happy to give a platform to the accusers that have come out against a then President Bill Clinton I to say that he's never started with women it's just ridiculous\nEven though he is calling for an investigation\nAfter judge Kavanaugh was banned in public service and in the public eye for over twenty six years been through six backgrounds investigation now part of a seven\nThat this is the first time you're ever hearing of any of these allegations the fact that all through all of those background checks not even an inkling of any of those things is ever come up despite the fact he was one of the top\nProsecutors for Ken Starr in in a major public position none of these things came up when he was nominated to be on the federal bench none of these things came up she has been a public figure and there's been a lot of opportunity for people to raise this issue and it never has and now at the eleventh hour the Democrats have exploited\nThis process and don't so publicly and it's a shame and he simply calling that out thanks so much\nSo I don't know if you could tell Sarah Huckabee Sanders is not having any of general Costas nonsense today did you hear how the friend that question well you know he was mocking or do any or would that do you want to hear the audio of what he actually said\nYou could if you wanted to say something about the tone vine I mean and then we can have a conversation about the town that was used to treat a Brett Kavanaugh if you're upset about innocent people being just marched right\nLet's listen to this was that that was the last\nLast night before last last night yeah the ... at one of his rallies or listen this was this is what they're asking about\nI have one right I Am one\nWell do you think it was it was one of the how did you get home I don't remember how did you get hurt on remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise] what [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where was I don't know what I was younger and [noise]\n\nAnd I ... a man slices shut\nMe up so that I mean it's so people are mad because they said oh he's\nHe's mocking her that is what he's doing is just so horrible why was he said that and I've seen I've seen a couple of conservatives the ones that are desperately trying to find some kind of foot hold\nThe ones that always well I'll say something about the administration after I say something bad about the administration's those individuals they have the day they are trying to show everyone how fair and balanced they are\nBut then they say something that I see so many ... especially a lot of upcoming people doing this stop it you just it makes you look so bad\nTo be honest if you don't agree with that just say I don't agree with it if you agree with that they agree with that what was factually incorrect about what he said anybody let's start with that question what was factually incorrect about what the president just said\nNobody knows he's pointing out the inconsistencies and her account he's pointing out the inconsistencies in her testimony\nIs pointing out the inconsistencies that are between the letter to issue the letter to that Feinstein had some of the the the tests that the um uh the synopsis of the\nPolygraph et cetera et cetera there's a lot of inconsistencies there and that's exactly what he's pointing out and maybe if the media many in the media they worked as hard at looking at some of these inconsistencies as they do a damn your book quote from high school with Brett Kavanaugh\nMaybe they would I mean maybe the president then wouldn't have to ask these questions instead of\nIt may be depressed could do it so I and here's something else how many people that were sitting on the Senate Judiciary committee mocked Brett Kavanaugh because unless there's some sort of damning evidence
