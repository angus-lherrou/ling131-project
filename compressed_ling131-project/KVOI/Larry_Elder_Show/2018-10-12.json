going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nIt was about what's going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nWell you know the DMV it's it's kind of taking on a DMV kind of like shooting fish in a barrel I mean the ... are are just a competitor across you know go and get the DMV it's like a cross between a a bus station and the Soviet red line you know the five six hour wait we have now so\nWhat I thought was if we're doing a motor voter what worse agency could you can you have to ah to deal with this stuff in the department of motor vehicles and no no\nNo government agency or that does a pretty good job with databases and the DMV is notoriously awful it basically everything it it it does\nSo now we're going to allow the DMV to register voters and this was in a state where and I'm not against having driver's licenses for for non citizens just for practical reasons but if you could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nAre back in two thousand or Fifteen when this was proposed and was of course accused of of being a racist\nOr by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of a a voter registration so you're the the DMV report it last month going to be twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots other potentially a mistakenly registered by the DMV uh the DMV insist that no illegal or legal immigrants have as a gotten them but it looks like some\nPotentially some non citizens have gotten these these ballots and then the LA Times look at a software that rather than Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventies that lets you know she's me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV and some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the DMV seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mess\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California is somewhat of a scandal and the\nUh you know again the DMV insists that uh you know a legal residents have voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses to where people provide a you know our information so that the security on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records and then the war when it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um\nWhere you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the ah the immigration status of the of the person uh you know who was being registered and in that last set of her person as a quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California or new voter motor voter program\nPerson's registration chubby presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get registered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault that it it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprised the envy may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure what that right\nYeah exactly I carry it and and I'm not you know my views on on immigration are really quite you know quite a courts I lean towards bloody as many people and that's as possible uh provided they follow some rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of\nImmigration restriction is then yeah I I you know I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if
