first of all like to thank you for playing that are some audio from night storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing that question\nI Believe we have the technology for financial institutions to prevent personal funds from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras Guatemala\nAnd I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense or the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're having\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do with the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nIs I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse uh and uh would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument against a Mexico his at Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks

year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency change it I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what

less said that it's all women and children there are some women who looks suspiciously like I'm In\nA lot of them they look just like man many many many many many men\nI saw more men and women and\nChildren came in let's say there is ten thousand listed as only five thousand\nBut not one hundred percent of those people are good people there there's a faction of those people that are there to take advantage of those\nThat are making the travel for some reason so you know for Democrats to support this and to continue to be a beacon in a magnet for people like this to show up illegally is actually harmful to their own life well yeah\nI mean and it contributes to the human trafficking\nIt's it's I mean because you're going to what is it some of the border patrol agents told me that they would carry a plan B\nFor some of these little girls that become a little girls that will come across I heard some horror stories and I'm either going to repeat here on air um for some of the border agents and some of the chief down there who am I have spoken to face to face whenever I've been down near the border and I\nMean it's amazing to think that the stuff happens and twenty Eighteen it is amazing to think that this happened\n... sick or is the fact that the media would rather paint this as Trump being evil and not accepting these caravans or whatnot as opposed to what really goes on to these people think about it like as\nIf these people because they said that they want to they they were trying to say that they want an amnesty and in Mexico city where you're going to have to fill out the paperwork and go through all of that well they didn't want to wait for the processing time\nDo you think that the processing time if they if they make it to the U.S border is going to be any easier or any faster than what they saw when they were at the border between Guatemala and Mexico\nHardly hardly doubt it\nThe president has said look this is a national emergency here\nUh they are the Caribbean has grown in size the president says it as a national emergency and he they've these meanwhile they've they ... they have successfully crossed into Mexico they regrouped ah the Mexican federal as their failed to turn\nBasically and\nThat he has said he's ready to send troops to the border\nBecause it's a national emergency emergency and that this is you know honestly also how or does everyone even have proper documentation et cetera et cetera et cetera\n\nIt is I've read in some instances it the Caribbean is either a mile or two miles long\nAnd for the most part they print been pretty unimpeded I mean I'm Sorry I looked when they were going across the border there and Guatemala and Mexico it didn't look like they were they were impeded at all\nThat it it didn't look at I mean they just busted the gates was just not it didn't look it didn't look I Need it didn't look that they it just looked like they walk right on through that and that was\nPretty much it so that's that's a that's problematic and if these individuals' darn aren't ... if they don't want to wait for\nIn Mexico for any because see that's the thing they didn't they didn't have to come to the United states they could have stopped and in Mexico and they could have filed for amnesty et cetera but that's not what they want to do\nThey want to go beyond that they're wanting to go all the way up to the border\nKane says if they cover about Fifteen to twenty miles per day could take anywhere from sixty to eighty days well that would be after mid term\nBut who knows what's gonna happen who knows what's going to happen at this point but there's\nAn edge to march up to the border in demand entry that's not going to work and if it's if it ends up being five to seven thousand\nAre they going to try to break through like what we saw because I've heard some people say that looks like an invasion and you know what their rights\nAgain you could have stopped and sought amnesty and Mexico but they didn't want to wait for that they just want it immediately go in and then they didn't want to stay there they're just going to go to the United states is it about amnesty you have to ask that question legitimately is it really about amnesty because you don't have to go all the way the United states\n\nSo and apparently some in the caravan and includes a number of deportees deportees who have some experience with all of it um because apparently now there's a second caravan that are formed in Honduras\nAnd they've already across in Guatemala and they're going to catch up to the main group that is now in Mexico\nA\nTraveling with them as a man named Anthony ... says eight twenty nine year old who was deported six times his last time just five months ago and so he's with marching and he's apparently advising people\nBut\nHow do you mean that's the thing what they're what people are going to want to do is they're going to want to have a stand off at the border\nAnd I think that they would time it to be I I don't know after a while it's going to happen after midterms by the time they end up getting there but I Do think that there are Democrats that won the object of having that stand\nOff at the border because can you go overboard can you overplay their hand\nThere's going to they're going to be some people who are going to I mean if you put a military response on the border to prevent this sort of storm in at the gates is what we saw from Guatemala and Mexico you're going to have that optic and on and tell you what you're going to have Democrats are going to be campaigning on that forever but that doesn't mean Republicans should shy away from doing the right thing and protecting America sovereignty\nYou don't have the right to demand entry into someone else's home no nor do you have the right to demand entry into someone an end to another country you just simply do not no matter what there is a legal process and you disrespect the country you disrespect the people in it by ignoring the legal process to enter the that particular sovereign entity\nAnd that's all there is to it it is a massive sign of disrespect it is a sign that says you cannot be trusted it is a sign that shows that you do not want to be in good faith into the country and be a part of this you know this citizenry family that's what it showcases\nAnd a sovereign entity doesn't have to let every person in they don't have to let anyone it it's a sovereign entity\nThe rules of the sovereign entity are not dictated by forces or people outside\nAnd this is this is it this is being used as political capitals what it is\nAnd I don't see any Democrats trying to dissuade any of these individuals from undertaking it's very dangerous twelve hundred plus mile journey to the southern border going through cartel country\nWhere people go missing constantly and no one ever stops to search for them because it's just too dangerous where cops or even killed there was one story about a border town well it was close to a border town that was in cartel country where the sheriff was murdered than a female took over because she was done with the crime and she became share of all they killed her to they don't care\n\nAnd this is all for what Democrats want the optic they want the optic of a Republican president and then they're going to make they're going to make comparisons to a um the civil rights when a who was it a Bull Connor or they're going to make comparisons to bulk up they're going to do all of that stuff\nI guarantee you that is what they're going to do that's what the plan is\nYou're going to have them go down there for a photo ops all of that stuff is going to be a huge thing\nAnd they're going to try to make those individuals who think that everyone should enter legally because the country has the right to know who is entering to make sure that you don't have bad characters and drain they're going to make those individuals look awful started that's what the goal is going to be in the media is going to work overtime to help them and how bad this is depends on what happens during midterms\nIt all depends on what happens with midterms\nSo coming out there's more NFL anthem drama there was a player pre games scuffle over kneeling and I just thought this was so bizarre this story also Cory Booker has been accused of sexually assaulting\nA man and\nComing up health and Human Services is moving to reestablish a sexual a scientific definition of sex and gender will have that story\nFor you as well and then Steven nice joined
