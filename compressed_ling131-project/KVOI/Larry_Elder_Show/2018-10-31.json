[noise]\nLarry fifty join you\nYeah thank you very much for taking the time professor I was fascinated by your piece that you co wrote on housing here in California is it true that the regulations Ruth restrictions literally ad fifty percent to the price of housing here in the state\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely do and in fact fifty percent might be an understatement 'em and they were there was a report in San Diego just two days ago indicating that building\nAnd affordable housing unit which is not a large unit is now at no cost to four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars um which just just teams are beyond the pale\nUm California is just the most expensive state in terms of regulation and it really does affect the price of housing and and the ability to\nPut a new construction and er which would which would bring housing prices at the California right now is forty nights and the country in terms of housing construction is very expensive to build that it's [noise]\nAnd it and it takes an awful lot of time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and recall studying economics in college or in in recognizing that the price of these regulations jacks up the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize it I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\nYes I think people are becoming more aware of it now given just how rapidly prices are rising I'm only about twenty six percent of California households and there's some\nTwenty six percent of California household and this includes households with multiple wage earners only about twenty six percent of households can afford the median priced home in California\nAnd people often think well what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley or forty two is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government to to put in place policies\nThat will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got to fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how you know the cost of regulation is what you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people in a recall you telling me that if anything I probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking exhilaration the benefits of these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two cops and twenty a virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars\nOff for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hands around around noon and one PM um that type of regulation feeds into\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market California's not placed regulations really benefiting consumers\nHad just a very weak and partial recovery from the oath of an overweight recession and the reason that had a very weak recovery is because she is economic policies didn't promote economic growth\nThat recovery was pretty much done by two thousand Thirteen and during the Obama years to country lost about Fifteen trillion dollars which is almost one year's worth of GDP under his leadership or like the economy growth rate really ramped up a once Trump came in and in my opinion that reflects\nChanges and regulations and changes in tax rates

Brian shelter who is making a statement that it's you know it's really it's Fox News it's doing all the dividing\nScary stories about a legal limits\nIt's really it's Fox News is doing all the dividing unless\nIt was scary stories about illegal immigration a rails against Democrats he's in Fox News pundits mode president most he makes the crowd\n... Saturday the president rightly tweeted about the evil attacking Pittsburgh he said we must unite to conquer\nWhat are they going to START I don't\nKnow your network ... you're the president of CNN blamed him for\nA ... uh the the bombings Dave ... the ... said that they were quote attacks on Trump's targets are you guys have been spreading along with other networks and other pundits and people who are associated the whole quote unquote mega bombers situation I don't recall any one having that same\nReaction when it was a Bernie boroughs who shot up a ball field or people who are on the left who decided that they were going to send rice in out or I Love by the way to spend that I saw from CNN recently when they said that the gunshots into a Hulu Shia county Republican office we're just quote vandalism in quote [noise]\nUm I don't see that being treated that particular way\nUm but I Do find it ironic that a network that wants to lecture everyone else about tone held a town hall where people were screaming burn her\nAnd we're trying to get up on the stage and a network where are they allowed everyone who they they did everything that they could to inflame pass and pass it ... to the breaking point purposefully\nSo that they could get the most viewers which is why I had very harsh words for that network pointedly and other networks that would behave in such a fashion the day after a this is a network that they routinely use the ... the guise of journalism to go after and try to settle scores with people politically\nAnd I'm not saying that any network is free from it but what bothers me is that they pretend to be objective while they do it and that's the thing that I find most concerning no one believes that you're being objective at least when people on Fox ... they come out and they say that they're conservative than they really don't leave any\nAny ... any space out all whatsoever to assume otherwise but the problem is that there are so many people on\nA with CNN that take offense and I know because I used to work there or they take offense\nTo\nThe assumption that they are editorializing or that they are part is an or that they do have an opinion either way\nThey believed that they believe the lie that they are somehow bipartisan an air presenting things and it completely objective manner and that just simply isn't the case\nNow no one expects people to not have any opinion out all whatsoever about the news\nBut when you choose other individuals namely your competitors of editorializing things and they've always been up front and honest about it\nWhile simultaneously denied that you yourself do the same thing while also presenting this ally of objective is to readers and to viewers as a way to get them to think that what you're doing is actual objective journalism when in fact there's no better than editorial position\nThan we have a problem we have a problem with with ... with with being disingenuous we have a problem with honesty we have a problem with consistency\nThat's what this is now\nAnd it's not just CNN audio somebody twenty six Mika Brzezinski goodness she also chimes in on this listen\nTo stop it you were holding\nActually had it puts you in ownership media companies that is spreading the white nationalist wise lives about leprosy lives about small pox lives about the others invading the\n... to take a look anywhere you're joining us ally of white nationalism you can invest in some of the Fox news programs and they thought\nOh my goodness that is so crazy so this really over money what ... what what place are they in by the way I don't know it was like Thirteen I I don't know I um [noise]\nOh goodness I and again they were just lecturing about tone\n\nIt isn't substantive disabled I simply just like\nWhat you're saying because you are a\n\nWell you would go because you're a racist and a white nationalist\nThis doesn't this doesn't work well for the laugh when they do when they engage and things like this this doesn't this doesn't help anybody and by the way there is even more uh the Washington Post Max Boot blamed right wing media for domestic terrorism Oh yes Oh yes oh there's more but wait there's more Florida\nSenator Bill Nelson compared to current political climate of the United states to Rwanda\nBefore a genocide that killed up to one million people in the Nineteen nineties\nGoodness we have more there's more [noise]\nIt keeps on going and a left wing billionaire Tom Sawyer runs it ran a Facebook app where he compared Trump to Saddam Hussein\nWhat\nOh and he also compare them to a Hugo Chavez which really\nI ...\nYou know he was a socialist right and it just gets it gets more and these are all people who are simultaneously lecturing about tone their lecture and about tone over and over and over\nWhile engaging in this well Joe Lieberman he finally had enough of all of this stuff from the media and everyone else and he decided he was um\nHe was on I think there's was he was brought on finally was he was on CNN and he pushed back\nThe a former Democratic vice presidential nominee wasn't buying it he was on CNN was seen as John Berman who was very trying very very hard Monday morning to get everyone on his panel to denounced Trump is some sort of\nMurder inspire or as a as amused from murderers\nAnd\n... a Lieberman wasn't having a news busters has the transcript he he said that the president's campaign attacks on George Soros ah we're all about anti Semitism\nIs essentially saying that any attack on me is just means you hate women logically it's the same\nWe're going to completely nullify your actual concerns and make it all about identity politics so as to take you out of the knees\nAnd leave you nothing to stand on because see if they can if they can paint you as an anti Semite then you can't disagree with anyone anymore because you're tainted good\nSo let's forget that he supports horrible policies and let's forget all of that if you you were going to cut you cannot disagree with anyone who is a B or C so by that logic anyone who disagrees with me hates women hates them and probably wants them to die", "show_name":
