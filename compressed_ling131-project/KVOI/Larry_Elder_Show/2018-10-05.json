a Saturday evening I think that's what the schedule\nIs we're going to go over that all later on in the show welcome to the program by the way I'm didn't last that the U.S on Twitter official down a latch on Facebook\nThat is what it looks like it's going to be happening the game looks to be over because\nThe FBI report concluded and delivered and Republicans say okay well\nAnd they're even some Democrats who say this to you got people like mansion and everyone's looking at Joe Donnelly as well to see\nWhat how that's gonna what's gonna happen with a with Joe Donnelly and this um and I pull that out but apparently can't uh but anyway this ah\nThat is absolutely correct absolutely absolutely correct so anything that the ... that the FBI were to get close to the Senate Judiciary committee which is insane that they're saying well we\nCan't we can't give this to you we want to give them to the FBI when we sit down for an investigation\nIt's a stupid delay tactic by her lawyers it make sense at all whatsoever to hold is one of the committee considering what they discover [laughter]\nTo the committee because\nEr into the background check the request of the Senate Judiciary committee that's right class that do it is to get the information so is she refuses to provide the evidence okay\nBye Felicia we're moving on we're going to hold a vote that's how this works you can't say well I demand that you consider this evidence and\nAs a way to corroborate my claim but I'm not going to show you this evidence okay by\nHow this works none of this works this way there is a process but it's not a criminal\nTrial yes thank you so much for reminding me that you know at that point were holding the vote\nAnd and by the way why perhaps it was in her lawyers goal this tactic\nMake for a looked like she wasn't entirely forthcoming during the hearing I mean let's let's examine what information did she not disclosed during the hearing because that was\nAnd I'm Sorry I'm having a Sam kennison moment guy that was the it\nWas the whole purpose of the whole purpose of having a hearing you don't go\nWait a minute there's some things and I purposely what else from the hearing that's not\n... no it doesn't work that way at all if you had to pick between a not how this works and B doesn't work this way actually both would be right\n[noise]\nSo this it was I mean it was pretty amazing to me to see that that and of course that's not gonna that's not going to work by the way one of my super super smarty pants lawyer friends who is a a litigator he says let 'em and what he ... he\nSays the failure to turn over relevant information actually in a courtroom lead to dismissals so they better be damn glad that this isn't a trial\nOoh\nOoh that's my little lawyer friend who lives in California so just than just saying it is and and so now and I'm also\nSuper I Am\nOf that with this other talking point all ... sect oh it is one of my favorites do you guys want to know what it is oh gosh it's okay so now I'm here now they they say because now that it\nShows ... interviewed by the FBI right they haven't said anything about Ramirez\nAnd I love to have dinner for Reuben to pretend conservative at the Washington Post the only reason Jennifer Rubin calls herself a conservative is because they have a bunch of of old angry progressive women already\nAnd that that's an over saturated market place so it's what is it is if you claim that you're a Republican or conservative and you've actually administration well then there's some ...\nThat you're a Republican or conservative and you pass the administration well then there's some click to be had there come on over there like me calling myself a football player her saying that she's a conservative columnist\nDidier so harsh this morning just to sit down and have a cookie that's where I can call you a football player it would be yeah I Know more about football machine hosted by conservatism oh my gosh and that's just not a lot\nSo she had asked serious question doesn't Deborah Ramirez count blah blah blah blah blah yeah they they they\nInterviewed her good job keeping up on the facts wants you to write a column about it but no one will read except a bitch about good job keeping up with the facts they interviewed her you know they interviewed mark judge for eleven thousand hours I don't remember how long it was like ours so that they interviewed\nHim nothing there nothing there so\nThis was the ... so they they made the talking point that they have is that while you know they didn't talk to the some of these people there are you know I Can't believe that there will be out and talk to some of these people wait a minute I'm Sorry you mean the people\nThat you told just like a year ago like a year ago or a couple of months ago after this guy's name came up that oh well I think he did something to me those people who heard at thirty six years later and they heard it secondhand you think that that's a corroborating witness\nPrayed sell sell high\nI just have to ask just got to ask I mean it's what what the\nLike Democrats sometimes think that the FBI will be Keystone Cops for them\nNow all of a sudden they're not happy with the FBI you remember that organization that it was essentially a thin to criticize just a couple of weeks ago Cain actually just a week ago do you remember them all sitting there like sketch these on that panel\nDark crystal reference they'll remember them sitting on that panel and they were saying oh my gosh we must have the FBI investigate it is the lead a simple ... set the FBI investigate this\nAs a main sent you a shouldn't have all of these I mean I use that as soon as we must remedy this\nBy in stealing the authority of investigation into the FBI because they will get to the boss him as it is Oh yes and then they all ... amongst themselves oh\nYes it's absolutely we must have them there I say cat and grass and I wish I into to vote on on this individual and hey we have a ... and that\nAnd then the FBI investigated and then they came back and said yeah\nAll good and now they're ...\nSo I have a list of who mad you want to hear my list of who mad pharaoh\nBooker Matt Feinstein mad a Democrat mad and now they're claiming there is a cover up\nI kid you not\nIt just gets better and better they stay there is a cover up you guys\nHow I mean I'm ... how\nHow in the world would that even be possible in any way\n\nHow would there be a cover up I mean it's only the most known about it and that's just\nWhat are they covering up some than\nI doesn't make any sense but that they're talking point that it's a big talking point in fact uh this is from listening to the uh audio soundbite a tutor to I guess somebody Twenty one Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer says this was all this wasn't good enough listen\nWe as many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized that what\n\nWhat what fares oh now\nSuddenly the FBI didn't do a good enough job that's what working as a nation who's skills and abilities and the resources and can be ... at the last at the last war and love our committee sat in late is no longer goldie NASA\nWell what do you what the hell you want what do you want for real\nI mean what what what are you all waiting for when it gets better because then Dianne Feinstein the woman who sat on his accusation for how many weeks who you know you could have had an investigation that lasted forever but you all thought you were going to be killed and sit on it and suddenly that doesn't look so cute anymore right\nYou're I Know you guys are yeah it's just not working so here is Feinstein discussing that she's she blames Trump\nThe White House certainly blocked access to millions of documents from judge Kavanaugh's record I Know that I'm at and ensuring that Ninety percent of his emails and memos weren't available for the Senate or the public in the hearings\nIt now appears that they also blocked the FBI he's from doing its job\nEx pats blocked\nExcept it's not true it's completely false and not true um in fact there has been a just with with Brett Kavanaugh there have been about nine hundred thousand pages of records\nWhich is more than the last five justices come by the last five\nYou're messed this up so when we come back more who mad and what's not stay with us [noise]\n\nOutdoor limited as your one spot stop for all your

this husband and wife team started the company and their garage four years ago and they believe in selling good products at a fair price\nAnd he uh\nThey wrote a piece of read the New Yorker about that and then his surrogates were saying\nWell you know if you need any any more evidence that the uh that this that this has turned them into ... at you know journalists become advocates will know and that's what Ronan Farrow is here he's he's he he I think undermined everything that he was building he became an advocate and forgot his journalistic purpose\nWhich was unfortunate because he had such a promising career now nobody can take them seriously anymore\nNo one can take them seriously they have tried they tried to delay delayed delayed delayed the lay\nYou had her\nAttorney saying well we're not going to we're not going to basically cooperate who by the way the say\nNo to the Senate Judiciary committee is that the new standard you can just say no I don't know you could do that she she wouldn't turn over her nose\nShe refused David French and attorney wrote about this my friend over at National Review\nHe said no she she outright said she wouldn't do it and it undercuts any effort he said this is a serious problem and it undercuts any effort to prove our claims against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe American legal system is characterized by mandated transparency\nAnd he goes what my friend and I said he says in criminal cases the prosecution is required to release exculpatory information\nIn other words it can be required to undercut its own case and civil litigation parties are generally required to turn over not just all relevant non privileged documents to the other side there are also require to turn over all documents that could lead to the discovery of relevant information\nThat's one reason why the decision to litigation ever be taken lightly 'cause you're opening just ended its called discoveries what the process is called\nSo [noise] but the Democrats kept saying on purpose well this isn't there a trial says job interview so essentially what they were saying is well we don't have to meet the standards of fairness or balance or anything like that we can just make a baseless accusation and not have to prove it that's what they were saying\nAnd in any other any other courtroom that would have been in a courtroom it would have been dismissed and it was and it and it should be a bit and should be dismissed here they can bitch and moan all they want you about something being incomplete but you all have nobody to think for yourself you got an individual who could not corroborate a single one of her claims\nYou got an individual who refused to cooperate and provide information to the Senate Judiciary committee that could have further shed perspective and an end in in some sort of\nAnd could have further illuminated the scope\nThe breath of her of what she says corroborated and was evidence of her claim she refused ... uh cooperate her attorneys refused to cooperate Democrats refused to cooperate and now they want to complain about the process and say that it wasn't it that it didn't include everything\nAgain why I have no idea what that\nIs insane\nSo going forward oh and I wanted to share this\nSo going forward oh and I wanted to share this to\nA a\nWheeling Kaiser's her family's speaking out there was a big I don't know if it's author of and checked with there's a bigger piece up about her ... that was a where her family spoke to the daily mail\nAnd she they say and apparently living Kaiser says Christine for through her under the bus\nYet and the family says yes she did not corroborate her story to the FBI\nA close relative express anger at Ford suggestion at Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges she said no health challenges of not impaired her memory but being caught up in the cabinet scandal has been physically trying\nThey're and they're mad they say she just she did they say that she just uh it was like she was dragged meant that Ford was called to the principal's office is is that the family member said it felt a lot like Christine was the one called to the principal's office to get an account of something and through Leland under the bus you know just reached foreign name\nAnd Howard J Walsh the third Kaiser's attorney a confirmed last night that Kaiser spoke with the FBI and when she did she could not corroborate forward to count instead she double down on what she already stated to the Senate committee\nDid you guys hear anything by the way in the media on MSNBC CNN any of them about FBI talking to leave and Kaiser\nNo\nAnd she completely did not corroborate Ford's account\nMhm\nSo she was the FBI I spoke with her and and remember Ford called her her best friend\n\nShe says she was my best friend at Holton arms and apparently even after she said that they were close and then Kaiser's relatives said that Keyser was shocked that she named her as a witness because she hadn't even spoken to her and several years she said it was like she just took a name out of the ether\nHuh [noise]\nNow she that yeah she had just kind of I think they talk via tax really but that was pretty much as you said she hadn't talked to her and several years\nSo the protesters are out in force as well\nAnd it looks like because we have two scenarios here and I you know like I said I was on Fox and friends this morning to ask you know what would happen what would happen if they if they didn't confirm Kavanaugh and I hope that the Republican Party does not play this kind of a gamble\nI actually like Senator Lindsey Graham suggestion that if that didn't happen and they didn't uh they weren't able to confirm him I think that he should be\nRe nominated Trump should re nominate him and then you appealed the sentence verdict to the ballot box and Utah all those people out there you'll elected me to fulfill my promises that I made and I filled my promises\nBut they are blocking your will in the Senate\nPulling across America shows and I could sit here and go over it with you\n\nPeople are infuriated over how Democrats handled this process which I'm going to discuss how it's tanking Democrats later on in the show and a number of states and a number of battleground races too and it's also increasing a GOP voter enthusiasm which is huge\nAnd Trump to say look I kept my promise the Senate's blocking\nYour will how are you going to respond\nEven if Kavanaugh is confirmed you only to realize you still need to turn out just\nAs you would if he wasn't and he was re nominated again to be confirmed after midterms\nBecause you see how Democrats are acting right now\nDid did you did you hear about the Democrat who was doc scene Dianne Feinstein staffer who docks everybody he was doc seeing all these Republican senators gel here about that Democrat in turn was arrested for doc seen by dachshund I mean he was taking all of their private information and putting it all over the Internet\nJackson Cosco age twenty seven can you be twenty seven years old and an intern\nHe uh was sharing all the details of Republican senators posted their private cell phone numbers apparently and everything on line he worked for ah Sheila Jackson Lee he worked for Dianne Feinstein\nAnd he has been hit with seven charges including including witness tampering identity theft and second degree burglary he was currently working for a number of Democrats but most are but at but really with Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd this I mean unbelievable he posted a lot of their details\nOn line with with with what goal you know ... they they boosted security at the Capitol after Mitch McConnell was a accosted in the airport Ted Cruz was ambushed at a restaurant\nYou had white powder center cruises office\nYeah stuffed into the White House\nRand Paul's wife spoke out she wrote an op ed saying my husband and Rand Paul in our family have suffered intimidation and threats\nShe says it's nine o'clock at night and as I watch out the window a sheriff's cars slowly drive past my home I'm grateful that they've offered to do extra patrols as someone just posted our home address and rent number all over the Internet that Democrat staffer\nAs a part of a broader effort to intimidate and threaten Republican members of Congress and their families I
