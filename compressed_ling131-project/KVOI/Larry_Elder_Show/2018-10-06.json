[noise]\nThere's a really good piece it's over a spectator it's a medium angles it's a duty to question for journalists malpractice has it's never been a practice\n\nThey say a reasonable objective established media would have spent far more time than it has in delving into Dr Ford's background and credibility and her veracity under oath especially if they think it's relevant to endlessly parse Brett Kavanaugh as high school yearbook joking memos about beach week and collegiate throwing of ice from a barroom glass\n\nThey say the examination must be done granted there is an important line not to be cross between rational examination of relevant information and on the other hand blaming her bullying the putative victim\nBut it has to be done you cannot be automatically seem to be guilty it's not a legal principle but a moral won a false allegation even if it never reached a court of law can ruin reputations in lives\nYeah most of the media has that that is that the only one who's veracity and character are legitimate grounds for investigation is the one accused of heinous acts and just try to very true to refute that idiocy by reference GQ Salem witches the Duke lacrosse team to University of Virginia fraternity\nThey go on and on they say\nThe in the case of Dr Ford several lines of investigative investigation journalist should have pursued without prejudice either way would include the following does she have political or financial motives\nShe claims she's fiercely independent but does that actually her record anytime a conservative makes any complain about a liberal the immediate assumption a news and headlines is that the complaint is politically motivated so why not at least asked a question here\nTo her ... her story about why she went to Myrtle counseling stand scrutiny apparently not she said that the marital tensions stumped for her demanding a second front door because of her fears of another assault but the second front door was actually

life join any fear of flying prior before she claims such fears the reason why she needed to delay the hearing answer apparently not\nWhy did she changed her story of an assault in the mid Nineteen eighties when she was in her late teens to Nineteen eighty two when she was just Fifteen as does her tail of struggling due to trauma match up with that timeline\nWhy did she offers so many shifting details in short order and leave so many links on her story why is it that her memory is credited as unquestionable with regard to Kavanaugh being the perpetrator but her manifold confusion of memory or accepted as being a relevant to\nThe perpetrator but her manifold confusion memory or accepted as being irrelevant to the former question why haven't reporters and editors been more interested in studying dichotomy between for lifting of her lifelong friend legal and Kaiser as president at the gathering and Kaiser's insistence that she never even knew Kavanaugh and remembers nothing remotely like what what was claimed\nHow could they accept without question sports contention editors unremarkable for Kaiser to forget such a gathering\nI what why did it take a British not American publication to explore Kaiser's status\nAnd finally for ... testified quite specifically that she didn't speak with anyone during that time frame other than my council yet entered the hearing with her
