a a a heart rending\nA weekend and she had some some things to say about the Pittsburgh a massacre and the president's attitude about it unifying uplifting words I Want you to hear them I don't want you to hear how you emotionally it struck her\nAnd then she opens the floor for questions guess what happens here we go\nIn the wake of the attack we witnessed Americans of every faith tradition coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community the president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country\nHip doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family\nThe president as the grandfather uh several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people and green for
