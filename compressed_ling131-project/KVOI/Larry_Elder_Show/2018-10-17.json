they thought they had a they thought they had it because they thought years he's a Republican\nThe Republican base is never going to put up with anything like this the Republicans are thought out and

been talking to some political operators including a his own dad can Williams Bennett who's a longtime political ops who worked for rock Obama Enron and Manuel\nSo that's something we might be able to save a and a cops that have to address that statute and swallowed a glass craft type\nAlthough Steve says chance the rapper denied it indoor somebody else well I still think he might be considering something anyway smoking gun says cops a suspect that they had this woman this crazy lady she uh apparently shooting a crack pipe to try to hide it from cop as they approached\nYeah that that's not going to work in the suspect had a lengthy ... she does well coming up James if he joins us to discuss Claire McCaskill\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and surprise your hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix it\nThis is why I recommend extended vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield can save you from pain for repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or the dealership fix your car it's your choice\nBut she tries to hide it from voters and she is struggling because Missouri's the state that went by Trump double digits and Missouri is the state where you have so many moderate Democrats blue collar Democrats voted for Trump\nAnd they're really disillusioned with ... with the Democrat Party and with people like McCaskill says she was very quiet if you notice she was very quiet on Kavanaugh\nShe's been very quiet on gun issues she said very quiet\nOn a lot of stuff well at least publicly but she did talk to project very tossed\nUnknowingly because they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think the first time by is of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen\n\nI mean\nYeah and when she has but the thing that she's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote unquote assault weapons\nBecause she said before I supported assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use is a catch all phrase for semi automatic firearms semi automatic rifle specifically but they would like all ... should be banned um and so her staff are actually spoke to this odd in another video listen I can show them\nBecause you store it is for [noise]\nGrowing mushrooms I think some of them is like a little bit\nMore soldiers worse which is insane to me because when you look it up yeah uniformed crime reports from twenty to twenty sixteen it shows at hand feet and says her more people three times over then some at a medic rifles but here we are James O'Keefe with project very fast action dot com where you can go and watch\nThis ah undercover this expos eight in full joins me now on the phone James always good to have your thanks for joining us\nGay data thanks for having me back again\nOf course oh this is ... ... people know Claire McCaskill Senator McCaskill in Missouri very tough race\nOr she's actually being challenged and this was the closest that anyone has ever come from from from basically you know taking her out politically getting her seat and she's been successful at it previously because she always presented herself as this moderate and she never on the big issues the hot issues that every other senator speaks on\nShe seemingly incredibly quiet and ... and and your experts say I'm actually kind of discovered why tell us about it\nWell Missouri Dana ... I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative more pro life they're more pro God of theirs are shrinking base that a clear as to appeal to so this video tape and side of her office shows her own staffers\nAre saying they're for field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters she says of course when we asked her about gun\nShe says of course when we asked her about gun bans we got clarification from her staff you've heard the soundbite they're semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick stole roast says that she has the same policies as President Obama but she has to\nMislead cheat and she says that people just can't know that she had the McCaskill above quote essentially have the same views on everything so there's this\nPattern in these red states Missouri being probably the strongest example or the Democrats half the why they have to mislead the voters because of the nature of the political dynamics in the state and that's what this video tape shows it shows over staffers saying\nWell she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything\nWow yeah she said that they ah what the video shows is that\nUh she still close with Obama that he can't come to Missouri to campaign for her otherwise it will\nAh make her look as though she's not a moderate it came out that she gets to take money from Planned Parenthood although they they don't publicize that they take money from a mom demand and apparently ... demand that Bloomberg astro turf gun control group comprise a lot of her staff\n[noise] hit us got Rob Mills who's one of the higher ups in our office says that she doesn't open ... support moms demand action because in this was a direct quote because quote it gets hurt her ability to get elected Missouri and see that and they're like well I don't want to support or even though they stand for the same policies so you're talking about his incremental approach where she'll\nShe'll do it a little bit at a time and he says ... coach he's really good about strategy and making sure that goal it can get their uh she's worked out stuff with moms demand to make sure that she can support their goals without supporting organization openly and there's this pattern in in Missouri where\nThe Democrats are there still are I guess a very tiny pro life Democrat community it's shrinking because most of those folks have have chosen to become Republicans but they're they're still she's still trying to\nLike she has to lie to half of the people and be honest with the other half and that's what this reporter so damning about because it just blows it all open there's a Greek chorus of people in our office all saying the same thing on all the issues Obama guns and Planned Parenthood\nThere's even a thing about impeachment where we ask this this staffer Glenn Winfrey is the staffers and it was just so tell us about ... plans to impeach truck\nAnd she goes we the staffer says we're going to tell the moderates to quote get over it\nOnce we pull a bait and switch on them you know so it's just all across the board inside of her office\nWow yeah and that and that was pretty I thought that was fascinating as well like get over it and that's what moderate\nDefinitely should pay attention to she's focusing on all of the things ultimately\nThat a cost Hillary Clinton the election and it's you know it's difficult for her because it is very much it's a Trump state\nUm a lot of Democrats voted for Trump and they're pretty pleased when you look at approval ratings and his approval ratings are in Missouri they're pretty pleased with what he's been doing and what it means for you know the manufacturing in that state um that I I I had she responded as to the\nUh because I I guess is she can tend to allow her staff to talk for her are all in all of a moderate to\nThat is the question I I was in Columbia yesterday Columbia, Missouri and I did talk to this next arose to walk down the street to his office and I do or stop them with a with a camera on my shoulder and a microphone and I said look you know what why aren't you honest with people and he said I Can't another authorized to speak to the press\nAnd I kind of felt proud because I kind of felt like say well neck they don't consider me a journalist so maybe you can talk to me but\nHe did not talk to me are we did get a comment from Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate he tweeted the video out twice and they usually what happens data has happened in Tennessee is that that first they'll they'll try not to talk about it and then there'll be this bubbling critical mass groundswell in from the grassroots\nIt'll go on local TV ONE of the local reporters last clear and she'll have to fumble and bumble that's typically how this stuff goes because there's nothing to say all of her staff are calling her a lot or what is she going to do fire all of her staff will\nThere be honest with you the staffer are being honest there they're on unbeknownst to them they're whistle blowers and they're being very honest and forthcoming about what she stands for so it'll be interesting to see the local TV stations in Missouri ask the questions\nYeah I Would I think that Missouri voters would like to I think everybody would like to know where she stands on it because she it's weird she'll be very vocal about where things and then she goes and hides when it gets really tough\nSo uh we'll see we'll reach out to her too although I don't think she will ever come on but uh well if we can yeah we've reached that were repeatedly she hates me so\nI got you got more from her than any other than any others during the ... project varied has ... dot com and I've tuned it out the video as Well James O'Keefe we're going to follow this closely because we'd love some clarification from Senator McCaskill as always thanks for joining us\nThank you so much take care\nYeah I Would love to the I'm just very curious and and did you hear and then the video too if you watch it the Sacramento yeah we got a lot of moms demand people that work here they're trying to import into that state just like they're trying to do in Nevada just like they're trying to do in ah Texas and everywhere else they're trying to Bloomberg is trying to import\nUh or export from New York end of the state New York style gun control meaning in New York state fact they are going to the state's going to make sure you store things the way the state wants it to et cetera et cetera uh but uh and and she's not vocal about it because it will cost her with voters\nSo voters in the state especially the more moderate ones\nYou know the only to figure out sort of where you you guys are going to be going with this ah because she looks like she and being on the up and up with you\nI Will reach out for clarification as well we have more to come including coming up Broadway star Patti LuPone says the Christian right is no different from al ...\nOh I Know I see\nYeah the president rips a Stormy Daniels right ... calling her horse face she says game on tiny and accuses him of ... this is where we are\nUh also it's only twenty two days until mid terms we have that twyla Barnes Cherokee genealogist joins us to further debunked all of Senator Elizabeth Warren's claims without Florida Man and so much more\nYou don't want to miss a single bit of it in the meantime as we get moving on I
