well\nI I don't have the the stats on white women in front of me but that's not what she said Sean chief specifically said that the Democrats have not taken the white vote in sixty years or one being Lyndon Johnson the other one being my husband and she was wrong\nBut earlier in that ... if you played that clip again it said women have voted for me okay\n'cause I heard I heard her say I heard her say that and then she made a second point in the second point was false second point was that a two time the last ... years the white vote has gone to the Democrats when in fact it only gone one time and that was Lyndon Johnson in Nineteen sixty four she also said my husband was the second one I play it again\nLike when all women went for me and [noise] look white women had then a voting against\nDemocratic presidential candidate for a decade now or the white votes has only been one twice\nIn the white vote has only been one twice now last I'm sixty here last sixty years my husband being one of the two\nAnd now he was not one of the two John So that's all I'm Talking about you were just wrong about that\nOkay I I liked that betting that ... thing she did say before that a white male or a Republican or a decade I mean again I Would if she was wearing white as white\nWell Shawn you're being awfully generous I Would like that people give the same kind of flexibility to things

Do that with Hillary\nWell here we met was a white woman that's not what she said she was very very specific she said the Democrats have not won the white vote in last sixty years when you do that

I mean it's it's it's awful and he's right that's exactly what it is a Venezuelan style socialism is just socialism period but\nMore currently scene in Venezuela and so everybody in their brothers mad at him because I dare you sit here and honestly talk about our things\nHow dare you say this so the Washington Post they decided to try to fact check it wa wa if you want to lose brain cells without

... over it being accurately accurately called what it is and don't do it\nSo\nAnd he's right he said he goes in practice the Democratic party so called Medicare for all I Would really be a Medicare

it's his I Know that Amazon now uses it for much watered down version of the recording engine Dava some rudimentary chores like removing duplicate resumes every time that they've ever done anything with that stuff\nWith that without AI it always ends horribly it always ends or like ... all the time the craziest thing\nYeah the wear and then last but not least ah the work you're going to watch on hurricane Michael as it has made landfall\nThere on the Florida Panhandle will bring you any developments that we have coming up Heidi Heitkamp condensed Hillary Clinton and Democrats tried to fight the mob label\n\nHave you ever taken your car and for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and surprise your hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty you're paying out of your own pocket to fix that\nThis is why I recommend extended vehicle protection from car shield if your car has five thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand miles ... can save you from paying for high repair bills replacing your engine or even a simple sensor can cost thousands when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or the dealership fix your car it's your choice\nThis was after I which I think is incredibly are responsible for Hillary Clinton to have said this because we're talking about a time of which Democrats shot up a congressional baseball field attack Senator Rand Paul in his yard sent powder and other things\nTo a Republican senator and other lawmakers offices um threatened the children of a number of Republican lawmakers ah docks Republican senators threatened to put the medical records of Republican senators children on line can I go should I go on\nThis is a time when people who are on the left have been protesting by burning down buildings and punching people in the head and engaging in property destruction and Hillary Clinton says this\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nSo she's saying civility we can't have civility until we have power\nThat's what she said we talked about her comments a little bit yesterday but I have more on and now she's saying that we cannot be civil until we have power\nWe're not going to be civil to you we're not going to be civil period until we have\nPower bottom line bottom line and this\nBy the way she's not on the same page as the media who is coordinating a massive push back against the mob narrative\nSo yeah and I have more on that so Heidi Heitkamp she uh said that she condemned\nAh Clinton's remarks Heitkamp said on Cooper last night I mean I Can't ... she said first off she said that it was ridiculous what she had said that what Hillary Clinton had said she said well it's ridiculous uh she said that\nAh it's that I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides high can't one points out she went on to add that she hopes we can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera so\nThat Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting to ah avoid the mob tactic now do you want to know why there's this coordinated effort to push back on the narrative of the mob and it's not a narrative it's just a fact\nWould you like to know why they're doing that\nI Want to take you back to the president's op ed\nLet me just take you back to this real quick I Want to take you back to the president's op ed in USA Today where and he discussed Venezuelan style socialism\nAnd he also discussed the on civil way that Democrats have been um having discussions on a ... everything every every policy\nOne of his ... was the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern uh and and he said he mentioned that again and his op ed but do you remember the speech that he did yeah can you give me this audio he says the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern but do you remember his audio he said you don't hand matches to an arsonist [noise] and you don't give\nPower to an angry left wing mob and that's what they've become [noise] he said you don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what they call them that was the president's quote from his rally the other day\nThat was the president's quote a Sunday night at a rally the day that Kavanaugh was assassinated started Saturday Night the data Kavanaugh was ah finally confirmed listen\n[noise] doing our\nLeft wing mom [laughter]\nCNN and MSNBC and everybody falling all over themselves to go back against the ... in fact broke Baldwin over on CNN wouldn't even say the word mob she literally said the ... word adios down by twenty three this is some of that discussion listen\nIt's because I Believe it's the overreaction of a left when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants\nBy a mob oh you're not going to use the law we're all we're totally of all it is without a job that there's no other word is a go put up along the GOP stop\nOut on a mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August ago law is not what we saw chasing right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls were not all that\nCivil protest or about 'em up I think it's usually a mall\nYeah it's a monitor what she was saying the N word earlier it's\nA mop it is a mob and show\nThey're they have to they have to respond to this because this is the way the behavior of Democrats el always works against them this is why they lose\nThey they they just blow through their strategy because they they fake it but they can make it 'cause they can't fake it that long\nThe real intent always comes out the ... the authoritarian as ... tendencies always come out to try to suppress difference of opinions or force\n\nYeah Charlottesville was a mob and you know what so it was the antifa on the left you know what was the Portland protest that we've been seen you know what though is the mob of people who went outside a lot of the rallies and we're doing the stuff that they were doing so is that\nThose are mobs did you see what happened on the inauguration that was a mob all of it was a mob\nViolence angry hateful mobs people punching people because they were a red hat people ripping hats off of people's heads at malls and restaurants et cetera et cetera people hounding other people in restaurants simply because of a difference of opinion running them down in airports attacking them in their yards\nShooting up a ball field violent mob like behavior\nJust insane\nThat that's the idea that they think that and remember these individuals' you can't get a Democrat to even condemn antifa it's they're good out the vote apparatus\nSo now they want to say well mob is it's a well mob the N word I Can't even believe anybody says that with a straight face\nThe dumbest thing I've ever heard\nOf sound by twenty five now here's we're seeing and tries to explain to you a mob like scenario\nCalling them a mob is that a bit much\nNo not when you see what they've been doing look uh I don't think you need to tell me that we want and need to tell those people out there that are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and chasing senators out of public restaurants and they only had US Senators are in an elevator sort of looks\nThe Republicans won they knew that that meant that the president would have the opportunity to appoint one possibly two nominees to be confirmed on the Supreme Court and they should actually acknowledge that if they spent more time handing out voter registration forms across the country they'd be much more effective that habit and prime tactic\nThey read a lot of people don't I mean all of us who doesn't mean that people don't get to object I mean that's your right American to object\nFor sure is covered in the first amendment for the other one yep sure they certainly have a government\nYep sure they for government\nSure they certainly can do that but what what are you saying and and we're seeing it across the country going to a restaurant and screaming at an elected official in a public restaurant\nAnd they did the thing that they're a fan or they've done the things of course the nails and many members of this administrator them because they object with the policies of of this president is and what ... what the elected officials were elected to do that's not how you go about doing it I\nSaid well you mean as calling and the mob\nThat's not accurate I mean people are going to object to I mean it's you know that's not my behavior they're angry with the way the country's got that mob behavior\nThe first amendment does not include busting down people's doors and engaging in violence\nAnd it's my behavior they're trying to justify mob behavior we were not wrong and we said that Maxine Waters was calling for this show called whereas she doubled and tripled down on it these are brown shirt tactics in which they want to find individuals who disagree with them and screaming shout and bullied them in public\nThe mob that we saw in in in Portland\nThat's not a First Amendment protection you don't get to beat somebody's car with a bat and cost thirty thousand dollars worth of damage that is not your First Amendment\nIt's not your First Amendment to get the records of somebody's children because you don't like the way their daddy voted and threatened to put the records of their children on the Internet\nThat's not that's not a First Amendment privilege it isn't the first amendment privilege to attack someone in their yard as they're doing yard work and beat them to where they have serious injuries and they're in the hospital with conclusions and broken ribs and pneumonia that's not your First Amendment right either\nJust as it is not your First Amendment right\nTo turn your objection into bullets that you let slide a congressional ball field because\nYou don't like those Republicans that's not your First Amendment right either\nCivility is you can be civil even in the face of hostility", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "11"}
