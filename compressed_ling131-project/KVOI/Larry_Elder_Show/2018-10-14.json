there a couple of good games one game really offensive when Ghana the wire one game was strong half but consistently even though a bunch of teams were off still a lot of action and\nJose let's start off with medical liberty wow the pioneers thirty for the alliance thirty three six and one seven and all those records changed but it was a sight to see and you saw\nYeah what a scene from the start stands were packed I think I have to park at a dirt road blocks away so it was it was great site in the wild factor believe\nIt or not other than the ... the final score was that liberty was actually a thirty three to fourteen in that game and they were controlling pretty much that entire game I don't know James Donahue were watching it as well um this was all the way up to the lake\nThird quarter I'm Jonah good bar the quarterback from liberty was having an upstanding game throwing the ball a pat are running the ball as well and then I think\nThe nickels defense at just pretty much go over and spark that rally by political to pull out of thirty four or thirty three winter there was an interception by Kyle Bryant which was huge after liberty scored their final touched down\nA there was a big hit on a third and ate a there was also sack by them and then when you got Spencer back there I mean you cannot give him the ball and I think you have to touch down there in late in the fourth quarter to pull out a victory but\nI've despite the loss of very impressed just like you were with with Brophy but I was very impressed by liberty and what they were able to do but\nI mean there was a huge huge game not just as far as taking our first place and the reason the playoff implicate absolutely much into it and we'll get into a little bit more as a progressive but what again what an ending to\nYeah you're a hundred percent right I think that that intersection by called Bryant really really changed everything because like you were saying they were down begun and Spencer came back and value them together\nReally impressed by Jonah go far though like eat tremendous athlete they say you Iran four hundred and state so he's a fast guy but he sure active unarmed too and he was battling all night and that last\nPlay the game was very close like a force in inches it came down to fill out the sticks to measure okay and that's how they walked off was by inches there so yeah heck of a game last night\nYeah it said to myself leading up to the week that is liberty hangs with them let alone leading cause I wasn't sure that was necessarily going to happen but if liberty stays in the game that means there are a force come playoff time and evidently they are they almost wonder darned game\nThe political crazies showed up but when their team was trailing they decided to take off or you go yeah and I think even a rather call them out on Twitter saying see you know shaking my head I can't believe all these ... you know 'cause I have half of the stands were empty a while to get in the fourth quarter so\nNow but they should have definitely stuck around what an ending I talked to defensive tackle drank or a after the game for political ask them did you guys change anything defensively what happened to support that rallies and no\nWe just got them fire under a button and find a so uh yeah they definitely did and they take over first place in that region\nNow the game that was lopsided final score but the half was just the first half was terrific the parrot whom as they defeat the Brophy Broncos thirty one to three and yes it sounds weird but I was impressed with

rich original host the strip ... hills next week to see which team remains undefeated in for a south west region and it's just so good to see these teams just seems\nThat haven't been dominant year and year out having great when total it just talks about the parody and the way that some of these guys are straight up getting coached up\nYeah I think it's exciting for communities for ... for them to rally around the team that they haven't been able to build rally rally around in that same way and sometimes I wanted to present with yet and that's your number for headlines from friday [noise]\nLucky number seven continue those little oil will get a chance to win a seven game of the season next week for the first time since two thousand fourteenth next to it's thirty five fourteen

schools that we haven't talked about uh you know these two teams are obviously on the west side and I I might end up going to that game but yeah we're definitely looking forward to see what happens there with west few ...\nAnd I tell you what jumped out in the about law where I was looking at the power rankings last week long voyage number seven gene Hamilton number\nEighteen when has that ever happened never\nKnow and a lot of people can be fined for the playoffs for certain the last few weeks and that is our a number three headline for for friday [noise]\nTwo of its Tempe highschool Buffalo's down forty two to twenty eight and a half they held thunderbirds or just one second half G D\nTo win a very high scoring game sixty six to forty nine camping needed that win because they were ranked number one seed shoo in for a ranking senior running back for our Williams with Ninety seven yards rushing touchdown Tempe is now six wins and losses and Jose you were talking about\nCan see is now six wins and losses and Jose you were talking about just some of those matchups next week Garrett battled for there's division titles well\nYeah they'll play greenway which we had we I think he talked to the coach before the season started we were thinking about to be one of the big surprises return a lot of players in that seem to be going into that game against simply there'll be the favorites\nBut this game I think ultimately determine who won the skyline region and will catch up with coach Brian ... Fifteen you had a lot to say about his office of my coach of what they're doing over there as far\nFrom the running the ball you guys know what to pass the ... you said a lot of people just passing out left and right but he is just running it up and down\nYes the most uh highest of the most points ever scored in in Tempe high history sick actually been planned for Nineteen twenty four last time they score sixty six points in the games in Nineteen fifty against\nAwful and Buffalo's or your number to highlight of the week [noise]\nIn a cool nickel pioneers valley back thirty three fourteen and the search for her to the liberty thirty forty thirty three\nPinnacle moved to seven and one is now a loan birthplace in desert valley region that teams are both rank the top three and six days so identical keeps on rolling and fight back against the when\nSpencer rattler is just amazing I mean when you have a guy like him up for you START I mean we talk a lot about three years starters and that sort of classified shelf but you're never ouch was fence around he proved that last night\nNot at all with uh the life signing and cameras everywhere I there's a documentary give me one you'd be once following them or for the next on Netflix liberty ...\nI think a to point conversion to fill the one they miss the P. A. T. so I Know that hurts them as well\nAnd in terms of playoffs this was huge because if pinnacle when in doubt the big thing about this game is that likely ended up with the number two seed\nAnd the obvious thing about that they'll be on the opposite side correct of challenge so I think that's what town are liberty also we're thinking about going into that Lima new\nLiberty might end up with a number three seed as well depending on which they've talked the rest of the way and you might have another rematch between these two of the some of these two teams I mean I think yes for sure I think up to this point in the season the\nChannel or number one for sure amicable number two and I would say liberties right there as well number three I I think even though they lost [noise] I'm a heartbreak or because they were on thirty three to fourteen but for them to to hang in there\nWorking political and being charges that gave for three quarters that's\nTough I mean I'll get back on that bus knowing that\nYou had a W but in the end you walk away with it now yeah hundred percent right and I think you look at panic although they have a lot of talented athlete surrounded Spencer you look to give up coming to an end and some of the other players he has a running back to ... Roland played really well last night so they have a lot of talent surrounding him and the defense really stepped up\nI think liberty got away from the run game a little bit too early to though they had control of the game and the third\nQuarter and started passing a little bit and and less Spencer an opening so that's the number one headlines and friday\n\nGood stuff as we sort of wrap things up around the valley and\nGuys will talk a little bit more in the second hour about just a playoff seatings in rankings but it's also yeah will be a two weeks from today will be over at a famous tapes and failing me brackets which was always a fun time we had a great time doing that last year look forward to doing that again this year but\nYou figure yeah indeed Chandler chemical and then after that it really starts to become a toss up but who's going to be number three and four and\nJose you are right you don't want to be you want to be in the I guess I ... you want to be a from Chandler channel is number one you don't want to be number four\nNo they're going after the third state championship in a row and uh I think they picked up some players obviously after the Fifteen minutes see some tremors ... black you don't want to be number five you know and you know once you've been looking at no point\nYou know there's no starting to creep up there yeah kind of do you think big went over chaperone last night forty two to twenty four\nAnd if they end up outside of the top eight seed you do not want to face and you don't know which team which mount pointed this show last you know it's like they've been winning or losing losing so we'll see how how it ends up with the last two games but that is one danger is the most you I don't think anybody wants to play in the in the playoffs\nAnd we can just try to keep the ball sustained some first downs and try to tire mouth but yeah that adds up to them and they they play real well on defense um luckily our defense played real well put off in ... in some good spots and we didn't take advantage of it\nAnd uh but our defense more three four down stops I was that was huge tonight in real proud of our defense\nHas challenged the indeed the thirty one points is obviously nice but the three points I think was just really most impressive\nYeah that would that was huge we told them you you have the potential defense with how you're playing what you're doing we we need to shut out because we knew our defense are are often could come out and struggle a little bit sometimes what happens with our op answers the guys are so used to work and so well\nAnd when we have to punt they really don't react very well they're not used to it and so we tried warm while we were gonna have to ... to ... it's OK\nMost teams dupont it's going to be okay we have to this is a good practice reacting to a good solid team and uh they did they they made us on several times a night and uh our boys responded well and they stay patient and and came through\nAnd Leslie did mention just wearing the team down wearing your opposition naturally that three headed monster comes in\nOh yeah we we have three great running backs and uh those those three kids were were okay to have them start him play the entire game but fortunately we get lucky we can keep 'em fresh weaken wrote to him every play every two place they all three have their specially strings\nBut they're all three can be an every down back which is we are very blessed to have those three kids with us thanks so much thank you\nKnow senior night last night that Perry high school as the plume is improved to six wins and losses what a way to go out no more home games left during the regular season but the way things are going\nThey'll have at least one home playoff game maybe even to all that more Fifteen eighty and the fanatics CBS Sports radio\nFolks it's pappy intern here I just learned about one of the cool features in some of our Toyota vehicles Siri eyes free you just connect your phobia Bluetooth and you have Syria at your service hands free\nOh why you drive sometimes I find myself going up to my car at lunch and talking with her or before dinner Mrs thinks that the pan odd I think it's a little odd that somebody is still says pad\nHealthpoint has greatly here and in your twenties my financing I\nThree from top spy new twenty Eighteen rat heart rate up and visit me tell you that probably like ...\nSeconds you know five thousand dollars you might have seen in my house I had money [noise]\nInside of the higher [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nSometimes fall short of a cap on\nThat is more than ...

that's what I think a great way you know they're putting up some some solid portrait no pilot dark the quarterback you are doing a good job over there while they got a solid running a church or essentially they've been shown some teams down so\nI looked at 'em a little bit [laughter]\nOh that's a very definitely appreciate just you're inside and um yeah James\nYes when you could walk as well do you guys the tightest school record for points in a game on on friday to do that and the first time he scored as many points he did since the fifties or do you give your guys any kind of shot up for that for scoring so many points and now you don't want to be in such a high scoring game all the time but\nI'm just at a school record are tired of school record last night as well\nBefore the record in before the the the fans of to NPR oh I'm In terms of what we do for boys or how we reward them as a day will drain way next\nWeek [laughter] but I think that's awesome council coach Walker

the Buffalo's from here on out\nThank you so much because of survey research\nAre riding that's coach Brian Walker the Tempe Buffalo's and yeah high scoring game James and certainly a jovial coach

confident of a Perry\nYes and then also uh there was one in markets than either and I can I forget her name or in this great soccer players well do you look it up but ah yeah\nGreat to see that I mean it's a solid checkers I mean for extra point to feel goes but for trinity with Perry she wasn't a more\nThe extra point she was more of the distance kicker and she was able to place the ball well so yeah it's great to see them have that skill level Christian we're was yes some Marcos outstanding\nOr just a a growing process you know you you get thrown into varsity game as a sophomore right out the gate and you play a Gilbert who's a very good football team and um tie you know it's been a great uh\nPersevere through an injury over the summer and he he didn't really didn't have much rocks and tell us about two weeks before the first game and so\nThe way he's matured through the whole a process of understanding reads taking care of the football to actually being a threat as a runner um he's now started to embody the whole position from a running decision making passing\n'em and putting us in situations to be successful so that's been the the cool thing to see over the last eight eight weeks\nAnd you mentioned injuries that was a big part if I'm correct of your season last year you guys were hit with a lot of things kind of elaborate on that\nAh yeah last year it are are are key guys went down especially our linebacker last year a corral um went down and then we had a couple of their key injuries that are on all sorts of linemen and a couple a\nOr other ... and so that that
