five quarterback since Richard Taylor been there\nIt's all about what happens to them in the trenches and arguably can have the best front seven in the state so defensively\n... all they do is put shut out so much for so far for in a row\nAnd then also we want to send our best to a larger ... sunrise mound\nWe understand he would say in the hospital last night or a after during that game against and also we heard he was moving to the extremities that he's doing All right so we're sending our best to Mr allies and hopefully we'll see I'm On the on the field because I'm pretty sure sunrise mountain also going to be there in the post season for the five day conference\nAnd most of the seams as we spoke about indeed will qualify for the post season but there are a lot of teams that are on the bubble Arcadia they felt\nIt was last night forty nine to thirty five various ... fourteen the twelve winter's over north point no there that was a terrific game antelope a was a big winner last night Barry Goldwater over our free at twenty eight Twenty one\nSouth Mountain was a winner over central thirty to forty one student me thirty two fourteen and ... tell us in twenty four fourteen why don't rattle off some of those teams\nYesterday on the playoff bubble but these teams have just had some outstanding years because for the most point most part the teams that we spoke about recently\nHad had three wins Chu wins and then all of a sudden you see lower oil with seven victories South Mountain with six when Barry Goldwater was six when it's been a long time since those teams knocked on the playoff door and had six or seven victories\nEven if they don't make the play offs it's worth mentioning some of the economy blitz Mississippi teams had carry tailor the job that he's done in the first season they didn't win the game ended up winning six games this year in his first seasonal records Taylor and how about Marco says well they beat Arcadia last night forty nine thirty five\nThey missed the last ... last week or so Eric lobbied the momentum that he's building here towards the end of the season over\nI so Eric lobbied the momentum that he's building here\nToward the end of the season over Marcos than either a lot to take into it to the off season you mentioned Barrett off\nUh six games a that's a a school record for them and I\nOne seven games first time ever for them a Goldwater they win six games first winning season since two thousand four for them so congratulations to go to the you know they don't make the playoffs they have a lot to work on the off season a lot to take into into next year as well\nThanks yeah South Mountain when in the seventh game for the first time in ten years as well and then you look at all as well one seven games last time they want seven games it's twenty fourteen so it's been that some time even taller than the last time a one seven games within twenty Thirteen so you have a lot of teams that have been\nStruggling for a while that are bouncing back and it's good to see it's good to see kids get open some excitement about communities that have had around the football teams and sometimes and I think that's another sign to the eighties up there and administration to look at like a guy like Terry Taylor guy that\nThat played high school ball here that's been in the community that younger coach that you give them a child and he can breathe some life into a program that I haven't had it and sometimes so and it's sometimes even the guy a chance that that has the energy and maybe hasn't had had coaching job before getting really read some reward for you\nHe might be a guy curtail that we need to have on our show because I look at what we did last year we had problems on all of the U.S gives me a Barry Goldwater\nAnd also the twins who coach over South Mountain with those two struggled a bit but look at what they did it in a year's time since we've had them on the show so I'm going to say we gave them a little luck as well as the cost of your skill and ability to sell might be time\nFor us to invite Arcadia absolute look through it and then also big shout out to men gifts or what have they done the\nLaws they end up in the region the Grand Canyon and read a very tough three ... three or four teams to the playoffs they end up losing Bobby young the legend who started that program is now the defense of corner for Notre Dame\nBut for them to come up to pull off this region victory and then pull off the region title as well over Prescott Pesca was in first place in that region makers wasn't second they pull out that victory and under the first year coach was a former player there are so congratulations to them congratulations to the Grand Canyon region we'll see how many teams they end up going to the\nPlayoffs and it is good just to be able to talk about some of the smaller schools it's not always about\nFive and six say although that is a huge part of it but to three and four a notch in some of those victories and getting some achievements winning the region titles that\nI'll say for me some time our news the little Colorado region that it's just fantastic so to be able to talk about some of these teams who are hours away from us in Mesa\nBidding for playoff spots in having successful seasons and that's what they an hours out of high school football is all about\nI don't know about you guys but last night as we're preparing for the bracket show a prepared for the show regular show today I was watching some baseball too there were some

we've got numerous other people that were going to thank for putting on this production but today for the most part it's all about football and brackets but\nSomething that you can just never take away from high school football is good old fashioned rivalries\nAnd for the one hundred and the fourth time Miami played globe and this was one of the more thrilling ones the Miami vandals thirty eight globe thirty five and very simply yes Miami may just even their record at five and five but they get to walk away with the copper kettle joke one\nHundred and fourth meeting you're not as quite amazing and then when it comes down to the final game of the regular season so it'd be like that guys we\nGames I think it's something that's missing a in Arizona we do have\nOr we saw last night with global Miami a flag and cocoa and then also with Peoria cactus but a hundred and forty meeting it's not the oldest rivalry I think the ground valley St john's ... Douglas those two are the oldest robberies in the state but when it comes to\nThe rubber that's never taken a break it ... it is globe with Miami so it's always nice to see those guys I don't think they'll probably get in the playoffs but would it doesn't really matter I wouldn't have to face off and is it fair to say no one's probably ever seen a hundred and four\nAll order says yeah but yeah congratulations to Miami and they're great great to be a community that the schools that I don't know what the distance it's been less than ten miles but thirty eight thirty five\nI was great to see and I would get the ... that's the that's the prize that's uh the the war that's been handed out so uh I definitely want to bring one home on these days a week bringing in\nSo that'd be cool maybe very cool and then also the\nFlagstaff Coconino meeting yeah the fiftieth meeting between Flagstaff in Coconino usually played at the end and you walk of sky dome but this time they played outdoors at the commerce stadium so\nAnd a heck of a scene that it is that it's up in the mountains and you have it just like this feel carved out into the mountains here for us right behind it is really beautiful\nAtmosphere up there but Coconino beat Flagstaff twenty four to ten\nSo Coconino going to last night was the fifteenth see but then you also have region winners that are going to be interesting to watch to see how coca needle ended up finishing out but they can victory for Coconino over Flagstaff last night\nJust to the setting as you mentioned and just I mean you guys I'm going to say dragged me up there last year for the sound burger classic and I was just amazed and like I said the pine trees and kind of a one sided stadium with the stands it's a it's a very pretty setting and it's great that they move that game outdoors\nYeah first time since Nineteen Seventy seven or they did not played in a youth played in a coma for field and now let's see what we get back to call ourselves Polanski here from a guy so I Know he's got some pull maybe he can\nTake us back next year for the phone burger classic up to come for field so you're dealing with a thumbs up as a guy that can make things happen as he got a lot of pool here like they'd rather than bleachers into because there's going to\nBe so crowded there to bring an extra stands to make sure there's enough room to accommodate everybody that wants to watch that game so windows two teams get together at north a lot of people could fill up for it\nAnd speaking of drivers another robbery took place last night Peoria cactus the fortieth anniversary for this rivalry and to Rob price I think uh at his name and the history books when it comes to this ... I think the guy will be talking about\nTen Fifteen Years from now because he put on a show last night for touchdowns just in the first half you that track speed to break away from long runs ended up with five ... game as\nIt gets to victory in that one and you got to think that victory I don't Perry was ranked number nine going into has probably going to help on the set up a home\nFirst round game for their first a for a playoff\nGame next week and we'll see who they face off cactus having a great a season or the coach ... was there for the first time I after last can hire I Want to say well do you find\nThirty nine matchup between there so we wish the best also to cook fucking are still out there as well but what if he's in those two things I think the Thirteen desert adds another thing from that region there probably are they ended up in that region are going to get a pretty much I see it as well so we will find out what ends up with them\nA couple of the current moment says we talk about some of the things from last night as we prepare to unveil the brackets here in the next hour a very cool moment up at Prescott a senior Ryan tighter bono [noise]\nUh this kid a very you know everybody\nHer on campus or he ran into a ... the running back for Prescott during a I think a school day this week and a\nHas Down syndrome and he had told Silas you know my\nWas to get in the game to seniors knees and uh so Silas did everything he could he talked to a political director the I ain't got involved the officials got involved so Mr Ryan talk of the bottom of the coin flip and after he did the coin flip before last night's game it gets me is\nThat given the ball twenty five yard touchdown that's awesome to set off a game a blind burden or a sports editor of the daily courier captured that beautiful moment so we want to say congratulations to arrive congratulations to the Prescott family for pulling\nHarlem get off to an amazing start we see desert existed just essentially running the table more or less with the exception of highland mountain point obviously very solid queen creek having a great year matter of fact we did a show from queen creek high school very early in the season\nExtremely strong region as you said highly won the region but it will be no shocked to see a bunch of those teams get into the postseason\nGoing into that concrete deserve it forgave obviously they're losing Devin Larson Howard ... react and they had a week to prepare and coaching staff of the Sherman ... excellent coaching staff so I was wondering how they're going to react to that and then playing deserve is a very solid desert vista team\nBut to pull off you know thirty five and they were close there was a thirty five twenty eight\nOr try to read all the backup quarterback or took over now lower ... creek I already had excellent game are ... there from the game a from a kind of life perhaps he said that Trey had an excellent game I think Trey is a sign of the the flight director there queen creek so don't count quick quick out\nThere but there is something we learned from last flight was definitely great quicker selling if they moved up to six say they played excellent all year long they have always been able to run the ball as well so we'll see what what trade present here in the post season and what ... going to do but\nEven though they lost their lesson and we had lots of member yes he did yes I think a lot of Star Wars yeah\nSet out to a big red or you know it's sad that we lost him congratulations on the career yet I Know\nRooting for him I Know he wants to get some more offers so we definitely want to send our best to ham it will be rooting for him wherever he ends up when it comes to college ball\nOne team that doesn't really have too much uncertainty at quarterback obviously Spencer rattler no longer eligible but J. D. Johnson he's a guy we spoke too early in the year via phone when he came in and relief\nAnd the pioneers I'm not going to say they're not going to miss a beat because it's very tough to just replace Spencer out there but they have a quarterback who already has an offer from University of Arizona I think he might even have multiple offers so indeed the pioneers aren't very good hands and like they did last night they put up forty two points\nI think they're going to put up to forty points a couple of more time to they move deeper yeah ...\nPercent ... a lot of ... wide receiver that's really tough defense that showed up both of them all year so they're going to be with him to watch still even wanna censor our out so keep your eyes on them or doesn't valley match up last night as well and the six eight ... division the at liberty and ... and offered playoff positioning\nA Lebanese yesterday three fifty one to Twenty one and not match up so they celebrity keeps on going heck of a season that led by coach march Smith\nIn five the Peoria a pure teams in Tehran sunrise mountain they stop so that's another one of those rivalry games and a genuine the northwest region they get a victory forty eight zero over sunrise not\nLast night I Believe that's four straight shut outs for Richard team the centennial coyote the defending five a state champions\nThere just tough there there's no way to just really tiptoe around that you're going to have to play a perfect game to beat Richard Taylor team and they're just in not going to say cruise control but they're in a very well oiled machine right now in this day and age\nWhere we got spreads an R. P. O. they managed to\nHeal our school as it gets when it comes talents and tell you I don't think they've ever had a power five quarterback since Richard Taylor been there it's all about what happens to them in the trenches\nArguably can have the best front seven in the state so defensively\nNot the best front seven in the state so defensively\nThey ... they all they do is pick shut outs and like you must have been for so far for in a row and then also we want to set up to a larger Anderson sunrise mound were understanding of the hospital last night or\nA after during that game against and pay no so we heard he was moving to the extremities that he's doing All right so we're sending our best to Mr allies and hopefully we'll see I'm On the on the field because I'm pretty sure sunrise non also going to be there in the post season for the five day conference\nAnd also that seems as we spoke about indeed will qualify for the post season but there are a lot of teams that are on the Bible\nArcadia they felt\nWas the last night forty nine to thirty five various ... fourteen twelve winter's over north point now that that was a terrific game antelope was a big winner last night\nBarry Goldwater over our free at twenty eight Twenty one South Mountain was a winner of essential thirty to forty one seems to be thirty two fourteen and ... tell us in twenty four fourteen why don't we rather off some of those teams\nYesterday on the playoff Bible but these teams have just had some outstanding years because for the most points most part the teams that we spoke about recently had had three wins Chu wins and then all of a sudden these ... with seven victories\nSouth Mountain with six when Barry Goldwater was six when it's been a long time since those teams\nKnocked on the play offs door and had six or seven victories yeah even\nIf they don't make the play offs it's worth mentioning some of the accomplishments of the teams had carry tailor the job that he's done in his first season they didn't win the game the end up winning six games this year and his first seasonal records Taylor and I bought Marco says well they beat Arcadia last night forty nine thirty five\nThey missed the last ... last week\nOr so Eric lobbied the momentum that he's building here toward the end of the season over Marcos than either a lot to take into it to the off season you mentioned ... a six games a that's a a school record for them and I bought one seven\nGames first time ever for them a Goldwater they win six games first winning season since two thousand four for them so congratulations to go team that you know they don't make the playoffs they have a lot to work on\nOff season lots of taking to the next year as well\nTo South Mountain when in the seventh game for the first time in ten years as well and then you look at all as well on seven games last time they want seven games is twenty fourteen so it's been spent some time even taller than the last time a one seven games within twenty Thirteen so you have a lot of teams that\nStrike was a little while that of bouncing back and it's good to see it's good to see kids get hope and excitement about communities that have had around that football teams and sometimes and I think it's another sign to the eighties out there and the minister rations to look at like a guy like Harry Taylor a guy that\nThat played high school ball here that's been in the community that younger coach that you give them a shot and he can breathe some life into a program that I haven't had it in some time so I mean sometimes even the guy a chance that that has the energy and maybe hasn't had had coaching job before getting really reach them or what for you\nHe might be a guy carriage that we need to have on our show because I look at what we\nDid last year we had a ... of the U.S gives me a Barry Goldwater and also the twins who coach over south mountains those teams struggled a bit but look at what they did it in a year's time since we've had them on the show so I'm going to say we gave them a little luck as well as of course they're skilled ability cell might be time for us to invite Arcadia\nAbsolute look through it and then also big shout out to Maine gets a what a topic gun\nLaws they end up winning the region the Grand Canyon readers very tough read it said three or four teams to the playoffs they ended up losing Bobby young the legend who started that program is now the defense of corner for Notre Dame\nBut for them to come off to pull off this region victory and then pull off the region title as well over Prescott Prescott was the first place in that region makers wasn't second they pull out that victory and under the first year coach was a former player there\nAre so congratulations to them congratulations to the Grand Canyon Reagan we'll see how many teams they ended up going to the playoffs and it is good just\nTo be able to talk about some of the smaller schools it's not always about five and six sale of that is a huge part of it but to three and four a notch in some of those victories and getting some achievements winning the region titles that\nI'll say for me some time or move the little Colorado region that is just fantastic so to be able to talk about some of these teams who are hours away from us in Mesa\nBidding for playoff spots in having successful seasons and that's what they an hours out of high school football is all about\nI don't know about you guys but last night as we're preparing for the brackets show a prepared for the show
