I Want it to the care man I'm Glad that are that trust for the call military out but another aspect but he was talking about very much for the media\nMaybe the drive by not talking about either is the process of polio as well as well as the migrants were Congo has also joined the caravan last month we had a ... migrants\nLast month we had a ... migrants from Africa from Central Africa with Ebola type symptoms of eagle pass Texas that was reported out of the Ebola outbreak map dot com website which I can to\nHelp people out with a kind of things that happen unless the mainstream news on your listeners probably would take notice of this aspect as well because the drive by don't like to talk about that because I think well there's a lot of votes um migrants talking about diseases coming across the border and did you have you been to that website as well\nI have not actually no I'm not I've I've heard of it I have not visited no sir\nIt's called it's called Ebola outbreak map math

resource for everybody that courage to go on there especially I ... and we're going to be voting for Trump\nBecause I see this problem in our country with migrants with\nDiseases and things that are doing to our country and it's just going a country that it's been so long the wrong way and this is a snack everybody\nEven look at Kennedy JFK used to say it was a Democrat and he said that the book and do what you said that you should get Kennedy said we need to do with that statement that said you care what Americans should care\nAbout astronaut and we'll ask not what you get your country can do for you asking is that what you can do for your country was the most famously\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm thinking I Wish you all Americans care about our country on our borders as not or how it can take about a democratic it's being an American and as Americans we should care care about our borders and our country\nAnd what's great why is that is a great point because you're right President Kennedy who is a very different kind of Democrat then there's the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country what can you do for this nation we not for the world not for the United nations\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us first nation first\nBachelor nationals I mean it is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge electrolytes said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever we sided that pledge using\nThis is where my allegiance laws don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national

around the world and Dana radio dot com one\nSo we're watching this developing story of all of these these ah these suspicious packages that were sent to a Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nA Governor Cuomo a as well as the the Clintons and ah the Obamas and a Eric Holder and that we know that\nThe ones that were sent to the Obamas uh I think it was both Obamas hole over and then and then there were sent to CNN too but at least four of them they have confirmed that they are a related as and it's the same\nUh it's the same in individual apparently behind it they had a Debbie Wasserman Schultz has a return address which is weird or the ones that Clinton for us we're not confirmed which is why didn't include those in there\nThere's a reason why I said they're specifically only for that they've confirmed because only four of them had Debbie Wasserman Schultz the ones that Clinton and Obama that those were completely separate so there's a reason why I said at the way I did [noise]\nUm the other thing that struck me as odd and I've been seeing some discussion about that so there was a photo of the one that was central Brennan\nAnd it had stamps are all over the package et cetera obviously but there wasn't posted marking on the stamps\nAnd then when you when you send a package and you you have stamps on it you get postage marks on the stamps right this didn't have them just didn't have any stamps on the package at all so\n... what\nI mean think about this as well um and someone else or a bunch of people that are make that a ... a couple of other people made this point to the a pipe bomb and they know and that can mean a number of things by the way the incendiary explosive device\nA but this particular device uses steel piping and when you're shipping a package\nYou are you are being charged by the weight of it and so some\nIndividuals apparently some people who even working or have worked in a post office before they were saying well the stick stamps wouldn't have covered that\nAnd everyone speculating you know just how heavy it would have been but they all were in agreement that well the ... wouldn't have covered that even if it went through but there were no posted posted markings on it at all whatsoever\nSo what ... what I Am wondering and what other people are questioning because the Soros one was hand delivered to that facility this seems like this was also hand delivered to now that makes me wonder was\nWere the Clinton ones was that hand delivered was\nI mean there were these I mean these were these all hand delivered\nI mean I think that that's kind of um I think that's kind of a fair\nPoint to ask and also if they were is there any\nWhich I'm sure they're looking at I mean if there's any sort of security footage et cetera et cetera where you could uh um where you can\nSee the uh\nYou can see you know just exactly who it was that that did it I don't know it's just that because that strikes me as weird I mean I'm looking at this photo of this and it strikes me as incredibly weird um do we have time I know it's our quick fry segment\nIt's time to take into some quick five okay yeah let's go ahead let's got\nTested for

was referring to the message me and said they still work with a post office had said if you're going to mail something if you know not pipe off you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nThan it would be you would you would have to put it in a box America this lay stuff in one of those old bubbly on bullets and and mail it and that's just not going to happen but I still say this

so we're going to continue watching this this ah this this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting developments and\nAnd I don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio Andrew Cuomo engaged in an earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous\nWe're not doing that um but this I'm telling you it is a it is big yeah ... ...\n... I mean six stamps for the weight of a steel pipe fix stamps for the weight of a steel pipe\nI just don't I don't see that I don't know\nI I someone also so Bryan on social media was also saying hard to determine the explosive weight but it couldn't have been much\nSo I this yeah I Am just really you've had since you have rights and that was sent well suspected rice and to Trump to James Mattis to Christopher Wray Gina Haspel Heather Wilson to John Richardson earlier this month\nUm and then did win if they determine uh who sent this\nThen I mean this is just getting out of hand this is just getting out of hand I mean this is you know just come on just come on\nAnd it but but and that was that was those were actual that was the actual domestic terrorism too I think this is also domestic terrorism\n\nSo we will ah\nWe're gonna we'll continue sea and said it will continue following these developments as we get them there was um apparently so now apparently a suspicious package was intercepted by Capitol Hill police and it was addressed to Maxine Waters according to several sources this\nOthers according to several sources this as per a B. C.\nSo this is a\nThis so they sent to Matthew right and I don't know if this is the same it we don't know anything about it at All right now at this particular point except that that was just it was intercepted in a it was sent a Capitol Hill police got it\nAnd and we'll see I'm sure we'll get more information more development as to whether or not it was like what we have seen with the Brennan package and with that pipe bomb et cetera but I'm just\nI mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um and\nThere are a lot of theories going around there's a lot of stuff going on I like to wait as we get more information\nI like to wait and see and the reason I say this is I go back to when you know they had the the election um ... Israel's last election what was it there there was a there was a report that there was um\nA bunch of bomb threats to all of these Jewish centers and everyone was thinking oh it's the political system says and it turned out to be this just just not job teenager and Israel\nAnd then back in twenty fourteen I'm a scorn spouse trying to find her husband ended up sending rice and letters to the New York city mayor and the White House back in twenty fourteen twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen so that's why I say you kind of all you all it's always smart to wait\nAnd then when you find out and then when when when we find out who and the motive then by all means but\nYeah this was that the envelope there was no sorting coat on the novel up there's no postage marks on the saddle whatsoever this was never handled by by United States postal service this package was not handled by the United States Postal service at all\nThis was hand deliver this point this ... this package with hand delivered so if it was hand delivered that means there's going to be closed circuit footage but here's the other thing I think about this\nNow it is possible because you have what you have the ah\n\nThe Clint yeah the President Clinton Obama's or in DC you have the I the Capitol\nHill ones I Would imagine are those I'm sure we'll we'll figure out if those were\nUm hand delivered are mailed but since all of these are hitting about the exact same time these all could not have been hand delivered correct or could they have\nAnd they do wouldn't that suggest there was more than one person involved right it's hard to believe because the hub were former presidents in the White House get their mail is where\nThese were discovered so unless your hand delivering to that special into the yeah the CNN the New York wasn't right and then later and I don't know where the Clinton sorting facility was that's why you're you pointed out to intern with those you know yeah that's exactly where it's a so with\nSome of it on now Laughlin mark hey over at the Daily Beast says he thinks that there isn't a he says it looks like there's an ISIS flag on a pipe bomb that was sent to Debbie Wasserman Schultz\n\nSo\nAlways I I I don't even want to try to before I verified but I Do think that it is\nA\n... that would be very and I don't again I think it's even too early to determine that\nSo there's just a lot a lot here and then that and then that brings up a whole other you know\nAre we going to have our mail system used for terror but this is absolutely domestic terrorism there's so\nMuch a there's a lot happening right now and uh and and and a lot a lot of development coming in on this and but I Am fat because that wasn't the only person who said this\nThis isn't the only person who said does this look like an ISIS flag lock on our K is not\nI Know I've ... I've known a lot going for ten years he's pretty much a moderate so yeah that's very interesting a lot of people are going to be looking at footage I Want to take a quick break and I'm going to round up just some of the developments 'cause there's a couple more um\nThat I Want to make sure that we have and uh when we go to break here I'm going to take that time to do that uh and then also we have other headlines to get into as well um ... because this is all of these happen around the same time\nAnd if if a lot of these were hand delivered that had to be more than one person\nI just don't and I I'm not ... I'm just saying I don't know how is it possible for it to not be so well we'll get into I we I Know we've got a lot to a lot to uh get into so uh we have a more stuff to come\nOr in the meantime as we get moving on I tell you one of the the best things to do to exercise your Second Amendment rights is to make sure that your training and that you are\nThat you know you're you're you have a particular skill set to defend your life and not have your loved one so that heaven forbid if you need those skills you can rely on them as opposed to not having them and need in them\nAnd that's one of the things that Cal Tech support Cal Tech is a very family oriented to a small business I mean they they started I mean George ... started the company I mean this is the tail of a\nA a as an American immigrants success story who created a very awesome business and that employs a lot of people a lot of veterans\nAnd they ... the the employees they're genuinely love their jobs\nAnd George is he's the driving force behind every innovative fire on that's manufactured by this company or whether it is you know their pistols whether it's the rifles whether it's you know the already the both hooked on right or\nThe pay three eighty which is the ... one of the most copied handguns out there a small a small carry a gun I loved I think everybody should have this particularly ladies\nUh tell type just does it right quality\nA safety innovation and affordability check them out at\nCal Tech weapons dot com K.
