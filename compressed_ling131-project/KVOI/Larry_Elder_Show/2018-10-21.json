with your way out but that was the um\nThe two great acts by the way el blood you know who I'm going to\nMake a request to Casey it doesn't have to be in the show but maybe next week or whatever how about some nineties dance tunes like mid nineties stuff [noise]\nThat would be that would really be a nice little pick me up to you know through it I I Am not dancing to the U.S I don't do a whole lot of dancing\nPeriod but not there was a good night he saw her early ... yeah and I hear the hours that seeing the alternative yeah he's when he was like three or four years old at least I Know some of the chance [laughter] book you up next we're dry out sort of laid back you guys\nGot fired from friday definitely one of my favorites segments of the show something that we kicked ran over the summer and housing James decided to introduce an I'm fully on board with it so let's get right to them [noise]\nWas the top storylines\nIt's time for the five from football fighter [noise]\nNumber five last night again that was broadcast on ESPN it was the technical pioneers defeating the chaperone fiber twenty three to seven but the big news in this game was very simply neither one of the starting quarterbacks\nPlayed in the contest Spencer rattler of I was gonna say Spencer rattler chaperone Spencer rattler pinnacle he's committed to Oklahoma was built against he against jak Miller of shop around two outstanding top notch quarterback but in the end neither one of them saw the field but\nChemical the pioneers just continue to steal their eight wins and one last and if you got to watch the game you did see some outstanding talent [noise]\nYeah it regardless of obviously to remove the two stars or rock we still have one quarterback for political back up to eighty who's a already has offers from South Carolina from you know so and I saw it more I think Lipman a tall tied him ended up you know the player of the game for that game\nI think critical pretty much just feel that region titled up or you know part of the ... by the number two seed insect say despite the dream big went by medical shop around now with the stroke jak Miller how long it's\nGoing to be out with his ... and how long have you know I think I did see crutches when I was what ... ... with the rattler but you know you're going to be back next week is walk without going to be ready for the playoffs so that's\nGood because they definitely need him more than chaperone needs more than medical needs Spencer rattler they're not as deep as the pioneers\nHe'll go on with the analysts he said he's out three to five weeks or the train them see out there and that's why we like kings the\nLander though while conceivably chaperone challenge ... could be over or I shouldn't say ... but uh oh Spencer rattler yeah if I ... we all are wild yeah oh that's a said he was feeling a little weird ... earlier in the week went for an MRI\nOn Wednesday and they said at the screen in the house and he was walking around he wasn't on crutches but he had a brace on that leg dead Olympic going that changes a lot of things come playoff time\nAnd that we'll say that your number five pilot for the week [noise]\nOf those games from the week coming in you thought was going to be a real close to one in the to aid to aid division Arizona Lucerne came into the game right number for Phoenix Christian number nine but Phoenix Christian roles Arizona Lutheran\nOr Phoenix Christian number nine but Phoenix Christian roles Arizona Lucerne fifty sixty nothing uh Phoenix Christian is in first place in the ... region he can clinched the region title with a win over Scottsdale Christian next week\nJust solid dominant defense Phoenix Christians plate of course very very well all year long and there are a couple of times or Phoenix Christian was actually on the road and I'm like you know what let me go see them but they were playing teams that\nHadn't notch the wind yet so I'm like I'll just take it for granted the Phoenix Christian will continue to roll and that's what they've been doing they scheduled tough early last week\nThe last year there are ... that was lacking in their schedule hurt them come playoff threats but a plane round valley they lots of ram alley but the you know they weren't there all the way to the end in overtime and had a couple of injuries that got some young players in there as well but\nFor them to pull out this victory the way they did and then I see that the way they defeated round valley last night that was another big game ... in a to a level now you're thinking because ... definitely the favorite admit to it\nMaybe Phoenix Christian is the second best team going into the into the playoffs I Believe now you write a victory last night over Arizona Lutheran so that was a big statement\nVictory by by Phoenix first and then we'll see what happened or once they get enough lousy how far they make it and that's your number four had lots of friday [noise]\nI got a set of big set out to our good buddy left of all the heat checked in here during the commercial break\nTo give us a heads up on what's going to happen in highland defeats does or rich but before that looks gets we're number three ... a headline\nHighland defeats cream creek thirty eight seven I think most of us were expecting a closer gay bread and highland does defeat does a rich next week they will be the central region champion\nThe ... team there is nothing that you can't like about them\nOff and special teams Austin max American dropped hunch like the best of them and his kickoffs fail in the end zone top fences runs properly defense extremely salad\nJust very down to earth real kids just really personal highland hawks are there on a mission and I mean they got some great senior leadership overall I really liked his hawks teams\nCould be dangerous team in the wild less well he's on the way to the Batman individual in Delaware state championship matches overt independence high and then let us know obviously if I was going to happen violent situations they wanted to raise is so big set up to last and I will say he is the number three had locked up for friday [noise]\nNumber two the market was to needs a Padres they upset mesquite with eight thirty five thirty for overtime when while who saw that coming as markers to me that I Want to say pretty much out of nowhere and just\nDid what they were supposed to do close game throughout the team had more than a seven point lead but in the end the homecoming game at Marcos saving the Padres always good to see those games Jose late in the year\nYeah we're going to take the blame for this because I don't ski was still\nWith us\nAnd we were expecting that it had one poor five in a row losing her first three\nWe're talking about if they win last night sets up a potential region championship game against the wall and lost my sets up a potential region championship game against the war oh and I miscarried about sixty three sixty or Seventy you know\nThey're not out of it obviously you know regardless of the score against the war all playing them is going to help them in the rankings but what happens now the Muskie or do they make it to the playoffs so huge upset and big congratulations to to go to Eric Lauer to a mark goes who was in his first season after coming over from mount point so that's a huge\nHuge victory for that program helps him probably during the off season built the momentum for next year in law\nAnd that is your number to highlight [noise]\nCame in ... number twenty eight and the ... and vision but Apache junction pulls off an upset win fifty three to fifty two over number three ranked Glendale and Rob your despite Kevin Daniel seven touchdown performance\n... head coach Vance Miller on later in the show to talk about the victory but heck of a win for Apache junction I think they\nA lot of hype out there in Glendale going into that game and Glendale than doing some really really big things under Rob York but\nHeck of a win by age either it was looking for ... junction and the first half you know there was going back and forth but they lose even for a to a fraction arm\nThirty eight seven victory tonight over queen creek you guys really just played excellent from start to finish this tell us a little bit about the strengths tonight\nWhile I'm I think the strengths were we buried up our coverage is to not just give them Larson one look and let them you know rip us up early so I think we mix it up enough that we were able to concentrate over ...\nI'm ... yes but I think they'll turnovers came because of our passion for the game or energy was so so high we just came out\nYou know with great focus and with great energy so defensively that's that's what health and an off actively I think our runs early\nPay dividends later 'cause we're only get like two and three yards carry but you know by half time I was like I think more wearing on them and I think that show the\nSecond half he gave it to a I'm going to say unknown running back at least for the opposition smacks Davis talks about that play call so\nMax is our fourth running back and he's a sophomore um [laughter]\nAnd he's he's one of those kids where we didn't have three studs ... junior and senior running backs a replay and [noise]\nUm but it's great because we put them in the fourth quarter and he's really fresh and the guys are not and he's really good so he's actually earlier in the year we got a couple touchdowns gets Hamilton too and it was the same stories and put 'em in late he's fresh because it's not their egos\nPhysicality you talked about on the fence but especially defense you guys spend the quarterback got back in the end zone could have been saved a couple of very close calls but overall I mean you guys just really were very dominant on the defensive and\nYes I I thought we did a great job of one can be in physical to run to the football and three not letting 'em setbacks like could be perceived as questionable calls we just we just moved on and we and we kept playing defense so that was awesome acts on thank you so much for your time coach thank you so much Brett\nHighland hawks eight wins in one last and they've got again game against desert ridge next week James yes exactly\nRight it's a big time when for highland and I was out at a mountain point does it rich game and I was able to catch up with their head coach rich well broke after they're twenty to twenty victory\nWith non point coach which well Brock ... the first half didn't start exactly I Would expect it down fourteen nothing didn't have a lot of things going on offensive we come back in the second half and move into football score Twenty one points in the first five minutes take me\nThrough the first what ended up to you know what they did to us up front\nOr they did a phenomenal job went off to add to our op eds as well as they you know obviously controlled the clock I think that one drive that they first started they tore down was over nine minutes you know and they did a great job coach out talking to staff and his kids you know implemented that gave led to the fullest and a limited our possessions and we couldn't getting rid of them in the first south\nWe talk we went into the half time came back out and I just said this is going to get a first down\nLet's go get a first down a little bit of a rhythm and let's see what happens and obviously we got a couple of play defense made a couple of big plays obviously scooping score and we get that other ... that looks like we're going to scoop it score so it was a you know we flipped a pretty good and uh\nLike I just told them let's get outta here because the the team in the first south is not exactly the team we want to remember this came by\nTo talk to me about your defenses well three second half turnovers you have to pick their late a couple of formal recoveries\nTalk about their performance I you know they may end up because there was a lot of guys out there that were in brand I mean you want to talk about brand new position they were in brand new positions lining up you know when the bell rang they ran out there and I did some really good things for us and ah [noise]\nIt's just fun to watch the kids fly around at times\nIt's been a very back and forth season for you guys ... everybody's trying to figure out which mountain point we can expect every week when I Am proved to five and four\nGot grown and we ... I'm not even worried about five and four that's called the winning streak we talked about it all week\nWe went when lives are lost when loss when we finally have a winning the world but now at this point for winning streak going next week appreciate the time those guys\nThey always very entertaining rich how Rockies or I'm going to say he's a character in a good way I mean he he brings energy ... everything he does and\nHe said there on a winning spray excuse me winning streak so we'll see what mountain point can continue to do in the final regular season game and moving into the post season\nA great you know by two gentlemen great interview great question graded side from a from the coaches so uh and speaking of mount point to an island\nOr I remember I think kind of had mentioned when they lost amount point they had no energy going into that or have up here I think ... point got up to a great hot start held off island and that's why they want to pull up again but yeah it's so great inside there from well Brock in in in a ... point\nYeah some so great inside there from well Brock and and and uh mount point finally get there with strict gone and uh I think they're building up that momentum and there's no quid also does a richer still got a spot and I know they've had a lot of transfers move out some injuries I Believe but\nYou never count other half cocked team and I was not surprised they played mom point tired and you know it was close came over to the yeah\nYeah you're a hundred percent right so they they really personified their coach out there you can really see it how they play and then they got they got to match up next week against island they are going to have to\nMake something happen but they're a team that can control the ball and they they mountain pointing doesn't rich play very similar styles of all it's a lot of running the run ball and and play into defense so\nThe interesting to see what they can do desert ridges right on that costs votes in a kind of come down to power points in equations that I'm that are are too smart for me so we'll we'll see how things shake out there absolutely\nYeah and and before we go to break a I wanted to talk about a player who that is no longer with us but we're still thinking about him and we're definitely thinking about his family er during these difficult times uh Carlos ...\nHe was the heart of the moon belly football team or who we tragically lost last year a after hit a in a football game\nOr he would get home for practice believe it or not guys and run five miles after every practice\nI'm at a case that occasion then smart guy but he had you know everybody loved him\nUh he was all energy all effort um talked to his parents you know this is what you know it was the was thinking about others about being an organ donor or we never complained um he kept on going I'm just ... you know\nWe want we want to send during these difficult times tell the ... valley family that

everyone to\nTry and use chicken tap definitely one of the best things going out there for high school sports well with high school sports just we're all at some big games and\nI Know I keep beating the highland talks to death but what did I learn from them last night I learned that they're going to be very tough out come postseason time they're extremely well balanced and very quietly\nThey might have the best special teams in the valley Austin McNamara is terrific from a kicking and punting scenario\nAnd for my game from the Glendale patches junction game what I learned was do not schedule scheduled to dumped him for homecoming\nThat are for [laughter] no fear a homecoming games against your opponents or Apache junction obviously\nYou know you know how it is sometimes you want to schedule somebody can defeat during homecoming get the crowd in the past you know it's just like you know what folks those days are over\nUh the fireworks going off last night uh over I Glendale high school not just a for Kevin Daniels said I get to them and then a second but also for Apache doctrine after they've pulled out the fifty three\nFifty two thrilling victory over Glenn do high and another thing I learned is\nKevin Daniels is the mad Glendale high school uh well I saw this kid I thought he was a college kid he is a big guy he could do it as a running back as a wide receiver Ralph evident ... last night um the kid I don't know if he's got any offers or not or what what's going on with his recruiting situation but\nHe is definitely a kid that you know to be honest with you I wasn't on my radar and uh I I don't know like I said well what what has recruited look like but\nAh he is definitely a kid who who's going to be a college bound kid right now because he's definitely got the physique he's got the body he's fast as well so despite the last great game by Mr Kevin Daniels I think he's more than thirty touchdowns\nAlready on the year for him\nAnd what I learned from my game I was out at a mountain point doesn't ridge mountain point that the victory twenty eight to twenty a mountain point as resilient they can they came from behind this time so previously in past me and my soul mates highland they were kind of winning the game and and played with the lead\nBut they were down fourteen to nothing in half they ended up fighting back taken a Twenty one to fourteen leader early in the third quarter and and finish off when twenty to twenty\nSo I'd I'd say I learned that mountain points resilient can come from behind and as a teen to watch heading into this fix saved playoffs\nI just want to give too quick shot out one to a running back for ... high school Israel Benjamin he picked up may offer from Brown University this past weekend yes kids all over the valley consistently get the offers but when you get an Ivy League offer\nAnd for me it's even more impressive because we're three thousand miles away from brown I mean honestly if I asked a lot of people I could go outside right now hey where's Brown University\nA lot of people may not realize where it is it's in Providence Rhode Island and it's one thing for a new what these kids to get recruited by brown an Ivy League school it's another for a kid in Arizona so props Israel Benjamin and the civil war will Sabre cats and also as I mentioned we always love the engagement\nDanny daily

wild game in Glendale Apache junction just feeding the Glendale cardinals\nFifty three to fifty two and I'm going to go on record in say Apache junction has the has one of my favorite highschool nicknamed the prospect is I think that's pretty cool and the head coach of the prospect is he joined us come on and co chance Miller how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks for having me on\nAbsolutely in coach so I'll just say I'll be see it's a long ride from age eight to Glendale but in the end it was certainly worth it I'm sure a amazing trip home\nOh it was a it it it definitely would have been a different feeling\nOf the game when it came out a little bit different but we were we were dancing the bus and sing and the whole way home where the kids were excited\nWalk us through the contest obviously it was a just a wild game and truth be told coach when I see a hundred and five points scored and\nKids had numerous kids having multiple touched on that kinda lose track of who scored first and well I Know who scores laugh at you guys but overall just kind of break some of it down and went nuts in some of the key points in the contest\nWell you know we we were trading scores in Glendale scored and third play the game um you know it took us a little bit of a dry but we ... we were just trade and all night from the outside perspective\nOf it it would look like ... defense showed up or either a defensive coordinator for the game plan together but you know they had a\nFit a great plan against us so I thought our plan was solid uh uh but both often says just had some amazing firepower last night we were just back and forth and back and forth and I got the it came down to turnovers and and uh so we we\nBest to them on turnovers by one day and that was that was the key in the game towards the end\nAnd you guys clearly won the second half obviously twenty points in the third quarter and a solid comeback in the fourth what were some of your half time adjustments\nWell if we were happy with our off it's a game plan you know obviously it was a it was working um I really liked what we were going into deep in with defensively um it it just wasn't paying them out the way we thought it was so we we actually\nWent back to uh some more of our our base defense of stuff that we've been run and most of the year um instead of the\nGlendale plan and uh I think by giving them a different look up front a slow down a little bit played a little bit different and secondary changed our coverage up a little bit and um\n[noise] it it it it proved to stop and that's really all we needed we knew we were trailing by a score all a game and we said you know if we can get the ball back in our hands for for two for two possessions we were confident we were going to score and and we got to stop when we need that\nFor a game winning streak guys started against Washington and then you had a couple of high scoring blow out when I look at the court tends victory sixty three to nothing not that much of a challenge but I Do you see guys played well\nWhere does it go from here obviously combs next week and I ask you kind of what they bring to the table but what do you guys really need to strengthen on as you try to make this push next week and into the postseason\nWell we're ... we're we're firing on all cylinders along with the right time of the year where we're teaching right now this is the same the same thing happened to us last year were showing a little bit off ... earlier in the year\nOf firing well towards our in our in our region play and and uh we were always playing some really good defense and I think we played really good defense this year\nUp ... no it doesn't show last night but we replace a really good defense this year\nAnd there are defense was keeping this and a lot of games and so now that we're our uh our officers kind of caught up with us um that that helps us out of reach 'em play so go into the combs next week coaches are across town rival recalled the battle of iron would\nAh right right down the road from us I'm so regardless of what causes record is it's going to be a battle just as it was last night [noise]\nUm so you know we're we're back in the film room It's MORNING and and putting together a game plan and so we just got to take care of comes to making the playoffs I go into the playoffs most likely because we're ... we're going to earn that uh that region bed to go into it you know Fifteen or sixteen seed will most likely look at\nThat swore south point and you know they're out there are any programs and\nUm you know we're just going to go out and play our best football or we can against them and ... and be happy that we made it to the play off two years in a row\nFor speaking with the head coach uh the Apache junction prospect advance Miller and Miller you guys\nMade the post season a year ago looking to do so again here in twenty eight Jean what were some of the differences are what are some of the difference is from last year to this year whether it is a change in senior leadership or just the way you guys have attacked opponents\nWell the last year we were very sophomore and junior heavy we only had a couple of seniors are varsity last year I think we had seven seniors and this year uh I have Eighteen\nAnd so were you were a little bit a little bit older but we're still pretty balanced between between the groups I have a one of my receivers as a freshman right now my star receiver Jordan Morris is outstanding six three got his first touchdown last night\nUm he's a he's going to be an amazing football player I I kind of compare him to mark Andrews those that desert mountains and went on to Oklahoma and now he's playing for the ravens he's a ... who I coach ... for a couple of years over doesn't mountain and and there's a lot of similarities between the two of them um\nHe's around six foot four he's about three hundred pounds and he's a good athlete for his side sand or it could really pushed some people around them creates some nice whole skirt Dominic an for Jake and he's been able to keep Jake's or or breaks throughout the whole season along with it is a fellow offensive lineman\nYou guys are scored at least thirty four points in every game and a big reason for that of course is Jake Smith headed off to the University of Texas next year just tell us more so about his senior leadership what he's doing in that locker room because we already know what he gets done in the field\nYeah you know ... kind of just lead by example he doesn't really say a whole lot\nUm he just goes about its business from the kids smell you know when he does say something made with and uh but but when it comes down to the tea he's more of a guy that just wants to go out there and do its thing\nHe's going to work hard and he's going to make lays on on the field and she just wants everyone to believe and she's gotten better I mean it's really you know you think guys like that they kind of get complacent that hasn't been the case with Jake\nAnd with a number of our receivers a strict practice they stay natural for an additional thirty thirty five minutes just working on their routes are working on eye hand coordination just doing all the little things that maybe some people don't want to do that kind of what's made him gray and he's thrived on that\nAnd we're talking to Notre Dame prep head coach George pre lock a coach that I Know you're a coach and you don't like talking about streets like this but twenty four regular season games in a row that you guys have one\nHeck of an an accomplishment coach you have one last game and your season I mean talk to us about just that that would be able to put that many wins in a row for your team and and what you guys do for you with that\nWell I'll tell you what it's difficult and stressful [laughter] that's the\nThing I Would have to say I'm Andy no we we take a sense of pride in what we do we we don't\nTry and look ahead and we take one game at a time and you know when you're able to do to block out everything else you don't look ahead you really able to focus on the task at hand and perform at a higher level and that's what we want to do and you know even more so specially at home you know we take pride in playing at home and we want to be\nA team that is tough to beat at home and uh you know a team that when we do go on the road we're going to try and give the owner our best shot so\nIt's extremely difficult and uh you know that's obviously quite the ... I'm really proud of of the boys and their boat you maintain their focus so\nWe can continue this thing\nWe know about your often so but defense I think it was going to be the biggest question mark for you guys especially when you pretty much everybody off of last year state run around team a whole bunch of new starters but you also pick up a I Would say are pretty good coach Bob young uh\nUh I Would say are pretty good coach Bob young uh who are the legend from high school whatever the coach young brought to that team because when it comes down to it or you haven't played the five powers yet and I think your defense is definitely have to definitely going to step up your during the stretch run for your team\nYeah I mean coach young who's got a great job of more than anything she it's been extremely beneficial me or my second year its head coach so I don't mean to learn a lot I'm so\nGood coach on was in a situation where he was kind of looking to not have so much on his plate and he contacted me the off season we obviously had a history way back when uh we were quite man gets all the time and we face them in an ashtray not the championship in two thousand seven a cardinal stadium\nI was just a young it says that aren't at NBC and\nJust had the most respect for him and\nYou know she is is a wealth of knowledge and he really how\nYou know the keys great with the kids the help me and when it comes down to it you know he's seen at all and when you have someone that scene at all I'm making now do you prepare for certain things and you know get ready for your situation that presented itself\nAnd coach what was practice like this week or just how you're going about your by we 'cause it seems like every school approaches it differently\nYeah will you want to do is we want to get out the obviously it's late in the season for that but by we happen to fall on our fault break as well so actually it's outstanding um so what we did was we practice early in the morning I'm\nFrom six to seven thirty we did that on Monday Wednesday and it was a film and it was weightlifting meant Tuesday Thursday we practice from six or seven thirty and we were in shows that we at a temple practice\nKind of accomplish some things we wanted to get done is we want to move forward here in the season and then I gave the boys this weekend off\nSo that they could really rejuvenate and get ready for hopefully the long haul from here on\nOur coach were definitely rooting for a against paradise ballet and when we look forward to talking with you hopefully throughout the month of
