of the mainstream I Do\nDemocratic minority whip Dick\nSenate campaign committee Tom killings of North Carolina but in the Republican post candidate on surge real or we're just seeing that natural closing of the mid term we have a brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll out this morning with some unusual result that you make a little nervous\nGoing to work\nFor insight and analysis on NBC News correspondent\nWashington Post columnist Eugene Robinson Peggy Noonan a columnist for the wall Street Journal and David rosy cheeked political analyst for CBS News welcome to Sunday meet the press [noise]\nGood Sunday morning and welcome to the choose your own adventure mid term elections\nIs there a democratic wave coming we've got data support that as a surge of post tapping on Tuesday has them for Republicans turn back the Democrats momentum\nThere's data to support that or could this be a typical midterm with Democrats making just bought a state\nThere's data to support that too and we have plenty of new data this morning here's what our brand new NBC News Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters\nDemocrats hold a seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one that's down significantly from the ... point lead Democrats held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty but wait there's more\nAmong likely voters the Democratic lean gross not shrinks gross to nine fifty to forty one here's why that's interesting\nIs the first time ever in our polling that are likely voter model shows a better number for the Democrats than the registered voter number normally\nIn midterms Republicans have the likely voter advantage so what's different this year it's the heightened enthusiasm for Democrats among millennials Latinos and younger women groups that historically have had low turnout rates that are making it into a likely voter model the sheer\nAsked for President Trump he has his best numbers yet in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent disapprove\nThat substantially better than his numbers last month in our poll forty or fifty to prove to support but again among those likely voters his numbers did get worse forty five percent of proof fifty two percent disapprove\nThere are a lot of questions leading up to this year's midterms but here's what we do know there's a higher interest in this election than any my term we ever measured turnout is going to be through the roof and the divide between men and women is growing with the Democratic strength the result of unprecedented support among women\nThat will be enough to stop the Republicans post Kavanaugh about that is going to be the story of the next sixteen days\nFor a Republican strategist Geoff\nPresident Trump's closing argument is all about the\nTo throw your borders wide open to deadly drugs and ruthless gang\nAnd Republican candidates are sounding more and more like Mr Trump repeating dire warnings on immigration\nRemember it's going to be an election of the caravan\nThe caravan is coming from Central America this migrant caravan pretty here at times using violent language\nYour body [noise]\nAnd I'm going to stop all over your face with golf spikes candidates or even recycling Mr Trump's insult\nThese are low energy person\nYou tell them what\nThe fight for control of the Senate playing out largely in states the president won this race first strategy banks on Mr Trump's ability to bring up voters in more rural areas where he is popular but the president's rhetoric is unlikely to help Republicans in the suburban house districts\nWhere they are already at a demographic disadvantage and for the first time ever\nIn two straight and be seen as Wall Street journal poll women favored democratic control of Congress by a whopping twenty five points\nMy thing now we're going to hell in a hand basket I I Can't believe some of the antics\nSeventy Seventy five house seats the cook Political Report racist competitive\nAre held by Republicans including twenty five that Hillary Clinton won in twenty sixteen Democrats need to flip just twenty three of those Seventy five to win back the house but the Democratic enthusiasm advantage\nHas narrowed after the capital fight and the question is whether those fundamentals will be enough to produce not just to take over by the way we existing conditions and meanwhile Democrats are avoiding abroad national message remaining laser focused on a single issue\nProtections for pre existing conditions protections for pre existing conditions for preexisting conditions preexisting conditions existing health conditions\nAnd with President Obama largely absent from the campaign trail and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi unpopular with independents Democrats running in states Trump won are running away from the national party\nAre you a Democrat I Am proud Democrat gosh it's hard to say proud I don't know that way I'm not sure that people are even prouder parties anymore\nAnd even running away from the Democratic leaders changing players make some sense I think we ought to change the players joining me now from Chicago is the Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin Senator Durbin welcome back to meet the press her good to be with a jerk\nI Know you couldn't see that package but you could hear it that last voice in there was the former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen who is running for the U.S Senate seat in Tennessee are calling for a quote change of players when it comes to the Democratic leadership\nOr you're a member of his Democratic leadership when you hear that um is there going to be a change of players fingers south Senator Schumer Nancy Pelosi or make your case for why\nIt isn't necessary a truck that's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspapers I bought an election on November six and let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the east\nThat's tomorrow's newspaper today's newspaper election on November six\nAnd let me tell you what we're doing we're focusing on the issues that make a difference I Know that you probably had the preexisting condition phrasing or dozen times in that leader and\nThat's because the American people put that has the highest priority they want protection for their families they know the Republicans voted consistently to take away the protection and file lawsuits to end it\nThat's why it's such an important issue over and over in a local basis\nBut let me go back to this leadership issue you heard that the other voice and there was fierce didn't send them out of the Democratic nominee in Arizona saying and people don't like parties anymore and obviously that both parties are on pop in our poll right now um is that a problem for you that there are voters out there that you need it went over who don't like the Democratic party\nBut you're having to basically make the case may you may not like us but don't you like the other side we're a last\nWell it gets down to this truck there more and more independent voters and I think ... correct in making that assertion but the bottom line is we are doing well with those independent voters take a look at what Mitch McConnell gave us this last week an insight into where the Republicans are going if they continue to control Congress\nIn order to deal with the deficits they've created with a tax bill for the wealthy people and special interest they are going to cut Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nThose are fighting words for a lot of people not just Democrats but independents as well pre existing conditions making sure the Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are strong for years to come\nThat's a good basis to get a lot of people elected to Congress\nOn a plane the er an ad that a Jacky Rosen she's the Democratic nominee running in Nevada and it's interesting and the message she's trying to send in Nevada voters which may surprise some viewers take a listen\nJackie rose and rose legislation to improve veterans' health care and President Trump signed into law Jackie stood up to Nancy Pelosi to reform the VA\nWhy aren't we hearing that this time around we don't really hear Republicans talking about repeal and replace is it because of the popularity of the pre existing condition collapse\nNow what for one thing it's a false narrative to say that we want to remove preexisting conditions I follow the bill got several co sponsors to try and and and the vet that a lawsuit throws out the Affordable CARE Act we have to have a place for people with preexisting conditions to land we also have to allow\nA young adults under the age of twenty six to be on their parents' health care plan it is a false narrative to say that Republicans want to kill that it's simply not\nTrue but if you had to do but in fairness you've had for years and the majority in the Senate to come up with an alternative in two years with full Republican control of Washington\nYeah and I know you know how do you say work probably better than I Do you got to get sixty votes to make that happen we did to reconciliation get rid of the individual mandate and take some of the underpinnings of the Affordable CARE Act out\nWe've got to replace it and the same way that we've got to make sure that shows for Social Security and Medicare can be paid for and Medicaid over time\nWhat what the Democrats are not mentioning are widely publicized reports that say if we stay on the current trajectory we're going to have a crisis in funding and those programs\nNo one wants to take away Medicare Social security or Medicaid from people who need it but we have to have a sustainable solution and we need sixty votes to get that done\nMath is a funny thing here in Washington nobody seems to want to ever site it but we have a record breaking deficit\nA record breaking dead every day when you watch the debt clock but a record breaking deficit this year that may surpass a trillion dollars you now annually never mind obviously the multi ... multiples of that in the debt the president yesterday talking about a new tax cut you're talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare ...\nWhere are you how you got to pay for this tax cut that the president is apparently proposed\nWell we've got to make sure that it's at least a supportive by facts round dynamic growth that has to pay for itself we can't go further in debt I voted against the spending bill I'm the most recent one because it was just too much money being spent a\nAnd and so we've got to we've got to get the American people to recognize that we had a powder keg of dynamite and the debt that continuing to grow we're reaching a point where the service to our debt service could exceed\nOur contribution in our investment in the military we've got to make sure that the American people understand we've got to balance our our book we got to be on a budget just like the American people\nYou just said you wanted that any new tax cut to pay for itself up this current cat tax cuts clearly not paying for itself the depth increasing not decreasing and there's no sign that it's going to decrease\nWell if you take a look at the scoring for economic growth every time we can I I think that there is a a way to\nRationalize that this tax cut will pay for itself through sustained economic growth we don't make the numbers at wall but if we do and we're already seeing it early into this cycle that I Do believe that we create the net incremental revenue is not going to be enough to come anywhere close to retiring are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt that's where we're going to have to look at\nTough choices so that we can balance our books\nCenter time tell us Republican from North Carolina I'm going to leave it there thanks for coming on sharing too much for thank you when we come back\nMore on those mid term elections which is stronger the Republicans was\nWas it the same democratic anger as President Trump panel is that as we go to bring some of what I heard

wrote a political analyst for CBS News welcome all so trying to figure out\nWhat this poll which is showing us today in our new NBC Wall Street Journal poll and let's put this sort of his put it a little bit of historical context here presidential job approval\nConnected to seats lost in the first midterm we go back here's President Trump sitting at forty seven percent that seems to be an improvement for him what would forty seven percent job rating mean in the past when it comes to the term result what President Obama had exactly that forty seven percent job approval rating and twenty ten\nHis party lost sixty three seats Bill Clinton in Nineteen Ninety four in the same period of time in October headache forty eight percent\nApproval rating and lost fifty four seats so Peggy Noonan should Republicans feel better or worse this morning when they look at the end be seen as\nWell I think they should feel as confused as everybody else the good news for Republicans is only six months ago I think we were all talking about a blue wave that we knew was coming and who's going to be very significant\nWe're not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated didn't state by state\nUm the continuing mystery that is not a mystery is how a president and ended minister ration can have\nWhat is essentially peace and prosperity for economic growth and no new wars and still be struggling to get to fifty percent which isn't the approval polls\nWhich if you can't use a drag on as well let's hear people it just is a central fact I think of the coming election set\nStandard political gravity and I don't think you can do that with Donald Trump and I and I do think that there is an argument to be made\nFor people telling pollsters one thing that believing another thing and I think that people should be wary of this going forward I mean it just feels a lot and I hate to be Debbie Downer for for Democrats or for any for Republicans for

this year more for mark at family minute dot org\nWelcome back the Trump Administration has broken records for turnover among staffers on the west wing just this week White House counsel Don McGahn left his job after months of speculation that after successfully shepherding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S Supreme Court already to White House is on a second cheapest at\nIts third national security advisor and its ... communications director\nThe person with me or most no worthy and short stint in the west wing is one of those five Anthony Scaramucci let the White House media shop protest eleven days with a new book about his time though in President Trump's orbit particularly before he became President Trump the blue collar president\nAnd he joins me now is just what you're working with the press had to Sunday so the timing of your book coming out problems as we got reports of a screaming match between a a former boss of yours John Kelly current chief of staff the national security adviser John Bolton was over\nThe issue of immigration was clear it was it according to our sources it was over\nSome comments the national security adviser made to the secretary of homeland security a former deputy to the chief of staff John Kelly apparently walked out furious there were rumors of a\nPotential resignation out how to live here with at St half a million was that thing to you\nWas there any profanity I mean that could have been right also possibly some profanity ... that seems really not that familiar to me and you have to remember my incident with a phone line with a reporter who I shouldn't have trusted in so that's my fault and I totally on that but I think that the more relevant thing is\nYou know people are playing the NFL and verbal contacts and so people playing very hard for the president um I don't know what happened in that specific incident and um but you know I I Know that the west wing and the way the president set up the west wing it it's it's tough in there for ...\nYou were pretty tough though in General Kelly in your book I'm going to put up an extra pair the general style would be in direct conflict with the way Mr Trump had always conducted business President Trump doesn't work in a precise way right never has never will it's been over a year since John Kelly became White House chief of staff but my scouting report early on proved to be quite accurate\nHis personal in security has proven to be a poor match\nWith the self confident gregarious president look I think that's pretty self\nEvident I mean just even this past week you know I applaud the general service of the country I'm obviously forty years in the U.S Marine Corps but this is a very different job this is a civilian base job and I think he's tried to apply\nMilitary like management style to a group of civilians and so that doesn't necessarily work and and\nAnd by the way you know the the president as a free wheeling style is very different from a\nJohn Kelly's you feel personally mistreated by John Kelly he seemed pretty new seem pretty upset at him and his book well listen not you know he didn't need to fire me the way fire me and I had this conversation with the president you get it done in a different manner totally I mean come on I gave a tremendous amount of money to campaign raised a tremendous amount of money\nOr did countless hours of media advocacy during the campaign and the transition and even after president was inaugurated a there was a better way to fire me but he was trying to make a spectacle out of it and so he got the spectacle that he wanted and it\nSaid was it was upsetting at the time or I write about in the book um what I thought was an honest assessment of him and I'm I stand by the words in the book should the president even have a chief of staff given the way he likes to work\nI think he needs the cheapest stab but he needs the cheapest David really likes him in and gets his personality you don't think John Kelly likes the president do you\nI mean I I I was living and I don't want to I don't want to crawl let let me say I travel around the country and I asked people that rhetorical question does it doesn't come across lady ... he does and and by the way the the Bob Woodward book I don't know he seems like a pretty accurate journalists to me so\nUh I don't like John Kelly calling the president thinks that he's called them I think it's I think it's wrong and and so for me I have no problem standing up for myself or or telling you what I think about John Kelly or the situation with the president\nHaving said that I applaud the guy service but it's not just Egypt you know he he hurt the morale inside the place and he ... he started to president and so and he has his effect you know he he left last week after the\nUh the report that he had with a basket or Bolton that's personality and ... you know the good news is I'm being vindicated by that because he's demonstrating his personality now the way millions from\nCares you've you've interacted with with President Trump as candidate Trump you weren't quite on board at first with the idea of him president you had other candidates who were interested in first I think you were more Scott Walker that the current governor Wisconsin toyed with going with Jeb Bush what finally convinced you that Donald Trump had what it took Scott Walker didn't\nSo I actually really just in the book I met with the president the day after The Apprentice finale or we sat in his office and we were joking about him running for president I didn't believe him at the time and I was already hooked into Scott Walker\nBut what I liked about the president and he's a very loyal guy when I explained to end up my loyalties were to Scott Walker and and Jeb Bush he then said okay well after I clean their clocks a when you come work for me and I should absolutely and so a after the south Carolina primary I went to the president's office with Senator Scott brown\nWho was a friend of mine from tops now we went up there together and uh we had a great conversation and we begin building blocks for the financing operation and then when he brought in Stephen us diminution a things really started kicking you know watching\nA bunch of Democrats thinking about trying to run against President Trump and twenty twenty and we've seen different potential candidates try to go after him in different ways\nLike eleven ... someone who I think people have been trying to put the two of you together for some sort of talk show and he's been he's tried to go out um directly Elizabeth Warren responded to some of the criticisms of crazy nickname stuff uh more formally\nUh what is the best way to go after President Trump what advice would you give a Democrat and how do you go after his idol look I\nYou know as you know I really care for the president and I'm a big supporter so I don't like giving them advice but I think the big mistake that they're all making is they go right into the Trump insect Twitter light and so the minute he shoots at them they cannot help themselves\nTwitter light and so the minute he shoots them they cannot help themselves and they drive themselves right into that light and then they get vaporized by him and so the incident with a Senator Warren she should really read my books or she can understand\nHow the president you have to think about the miracle what he did\nHe hijacked the Republican Party to get the nomination and then he hijacked the base of the other party and moved over to the Republican Party or and I try to write about that in the book because I haven't experienced as a kid to grow up in a blue collar neighborhood with the blue collar family and I think I've seen the whole band whether there's sort of stuff but my recommendation to people\nIs a don't engage them in that area because you're going to lose more than just way more talented than you in that area\nFor let you go you said your team you and your team from sky bridge capital citizen Twitter this week you were still going to go to the Saudi Arabia a finance conference yeah are you still is that still your final answer\nWhat a well you know listen sky bridge is not a political organization I um I get any American Idol and then I'm right now a while not really trying to give them credibility remember I have a ton of business and Saudi Arabia unrelated to the government\nHave a Kuwaiti a resident that services sky bridge out of the region and I'm a pretty big delegate er and I let those guys make a decision on whether or not to go or not he's visiting with people are not related to the government those meetings were already scheduled\nA he suggested to me is the managing partner sky bridge will allow him to go I'm a big delegate er and believing accountability comfortable that's still\nI'm I'm comfortable with him going I'm not comfortable with what happened or what the Saudi Government did to the journals I'm not comfortable that all Anthony Scaramucci had to leave it there the book like blue collar president congratulations George good luck on the ... like when we come back\nTo you hold

admitted man oh man give me some background how'd you get started in radio and all this stuff\nWell I appreciate market appreciate being home with your day because ah these are important time for us as gun owners they're dangerous times for our country they're dangerous time for us who care about freedom care about\nBeing able to take care of our families and I I think it is absolutely essential the job you're doing a certainly this was really really an\n... program and sort of I Want so we're going to promote your program at every opportunity um I you know I'm from the country\nAre there in North west Louisiana grew up a shooting guns are riding horses or ride motorcycles you know what I'm saying I have a couple of hot rods loan way and actually\nI began an entertainment career in music and we we continue to do that and and and thank you for mentioning we did have top ten record by two thousand Thirteen and I've had several things but back in the early Nineteen nineties Nineteen Ninety nine to not want\nA we decided\nTo uh put guns on TV because there weren't any\nAnd we I in some other people that that were enthusiastic about projects that way but you know we needed to show people how to shoot guns how to how to properly handled guns how to do the place of the gun in our society our culture\nAnd that was the original shooting show and it shows used at six and we we were up on satellite we were free to cable companies everywhere it wound up helping to build a\nA couple of TV networks alone way of radio network too as well\nAnd and it's just been a real privilege you know a couple of days ago I was at a veterans are gathering them jail\nA down into solved and vets people used to watch the shows you know so we we are so thankful for over the years the people that are really hung in there because we need more media\nPro gun media on TV ... comment\nWell you brought your show was really the precursor to it when we talk let's talk about a mutual friend or somebody that you haven't talked to in a while but it's a very very close friend of mine we spoke about off air over the last few days and that's for Mr Rashid thanked as you remember watching rock show\nOn uh from ... out there in Colorado a number of years ago su I\nYou know you gave birth to this stuff into that genre of television a long time ago and I want people to understand who we are talking to hear because it was you who who who are a lot of people look at as the the godfather of that genre of television on outdoor channel and everything else correct\nWhere it where it was due due humility I'm a ... year problem that you are at the end yeah you've\nGot you got to be careful if you take all the credit you might get all the blame you know what I'll\nTell you know what I Believe with that because when you look at quality of programming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you\nI'd be more than happy to say that I take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental\nIn creating that type of television programming it of course it splintered off and we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get well we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that your movie you did I mean how many how many radio shows you know thousands thousands\nThousands radio show where you are done trust your radio digital radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we have good old time at it you know as you and I discussed it is so important what we're doing and and we will talk about this with combat\nShould have something really exciting that you're going to be all and all it is going to just add to the mix you know you talked about the other us photo shows came after us because it's so critical\nThat we have pro gun images because a lot just deposed said hey you know we're surrounded we can find them in a way we go we got it right where we want and they can't write the family\nYou know that's that's true that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right\nWhere they are ... you know and and that's and that's pretty much how I think a lot of people feel\nAbout where we are right now at least if you watch the mainstream lame stream lying propaganda media\nYou know they're they're they hate us they've surrounded us and all that stuff but we're fighting our way out of this no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Johnny freedom will always prevail it might be one hell of a battle\nOr a number of battles and it always is a number of battle but nonetheless uh you know I I think freedom always prevail right so some of the things I Want to cover with you when we come back we got a lot of ground to cover fortunately my next two segments are are fairly good size segments so we'll be able to spend some time there\nBut you know a real I Want to I Want to cover some of your your shows with you what we're talking about doing down the road want to talk about what tombstones doing down the road very important coming out of tune with the freedom day's coming up in June again I guess that'll be the fish but before I go there arguing busy today are you in tombstone\nOh actually I'm looking over in the Mexico as we speak ... down on the order\nThem that we were well but we're actually based out of tombstone and it is like\nYou said one of the most unique places in the world so a historically significant in the development of the Old West it in fact are the the Old West image around the world to stone is actually bigger than life and it's\nAll did a lot of uh you know a\nMuch to talk about there and and so really it was just such a pleasure to meet you to see you and Allen there oh this past week\nYou know that was a lot of fun and to row into town with Alan Gottlieb was you know\nUh it there's that just added a whole new sense of fun you know as you know actually going to do so for you know a quarter of a century because of that has drawn to it and to roll into town with Mr Gottlieb responding to know that he sat over there in the wider room at the Larry a motel pen that I read an op ed that was a running\nI'm a student of their hypocrisy in lives for well over a decade now we call it out at every twist and turn we got but yeah I think it's great to see you there\nTo be able to be bringing some of what you're going to be bringing\nFrom that area that as you mentioned is so rich in history and its captivated me for a number of years\nYou know you mentioned the movie's really fun stuff you know the original the tombstone movie in Nineteen Ninety three I Believe in Ninety four with Val Kilmer Kurt Russell a little bit more than ... than the others that you know Val Kilmer played a a version of ... and then you go over to the wire DARPA Dennis Quaid\nPlayed a little bit more I I think the wider movie it was a little bit more historically accurate because it covers him earlier aspects of his life and how they tap their versus just show up there but really colorful history in that area that comes alive when you get there and as you know\nYou came to the very end when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb\nAnd uh I don't know if the mayor was there when you got there and not the\nPoint that segment with him was just off the hook who I could have kept him for an hour and talked about oh definitely hit on you know\nHe's he saw Dustin Dustin ... he's got a friend of mine\nA dusty and go on and off for that matter and and you're exactly right of a and you know what I was so proud this past year and now I'm looking forward you folks get out here for the next freedom days but a dusty stood up for\nFor Arizona and ... to ... stood up for the second amendment or in the mark\nUp but look where for climbing the second amendment say yes or\nNo no ... that he he absolutely did when he read that and we read the proclamation on the show I Believe you're going to hear you I think we're going to hear\nGordon read it in the third our as I as I replay that amazing find our from Tucson but you know that made global news that wasn't he did make news in Tucson that made news all over the world\nWhen when ah when Dustin stood up for the second amendment and to ... because to stone people come there you got this little town of about two thousand people out in the middle of Arizona\nIn what most people say how they even find this place and people from all over the world make the pilgrimage there because of its rich history people go and show up and that's very very cool now let's talk about the freedom day's coming up in June I'll be there you'll be there Allen\nWill hopefully be there are dependent on his schedule we never know but I'm the freedom days is what\nA ... in the first ... first of July\nAnd the end of June July and it is celebrating what we have\nHere in our country this so you make and and you know what you're talking about freedom days and that's because that's the name of muscle my name is freedom one that's the best for us but but the the point is the American gun will\nActually stands and the way we the American gun stand in the way of the global as police state is\nIs that is literally the armed American\nBut that is literally the armed American citizen you know our country is supposed to be governed from the bottom up from the people to top rather than from the top down and we the\nPeople that are armed we are absolutely the the line of defense for the cause of liberty him a war and that's what we're celebrating here and\nI'm hopeful that there'll be some other cities got a quick story\nSo we're not a million a year just to let you know we've got about a minute I think coming up in the segment so go ahead\nOh hurt or you know we've had some some folks from up for the country people come from all over and there was a lady from North of the U.S border I won't do that without mentioning those specific but some of these folks come down so stole may not be as pro gun on his way are you on to say though\nIs laid out of their lives that were there and and talking to some people in this lady comes in and she's also would call
