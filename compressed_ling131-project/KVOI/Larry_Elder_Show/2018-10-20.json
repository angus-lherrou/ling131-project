case he's because many women who have been mistreated abused or by man either at the workplace or not or any sort of want to pay back\nAnd I feel the same way same thing happened with the OJ Simpson case a lot of blacks feeling that they were mistreated by the police\nFeel that they had been hurt by racism and as a result they were pulling for an acquittal just to get back at the man or incorrect there's a documentary on the OJ Simpson case and they interviewed one of the George her name is Kerry bass and listen to what she said Kirk\nMembers of the\n\n... do you think [noise] Oh nice [laughter] and\nShe said she voted to find him not guilty because of Rodney King and when the documentarian to head of the other blacks in the jury feel that they are the black from the dirty feel that way she said Ninety percent of us did and then he said is that right to meaning is that um the appropriate thing to do is that there is that just she just two of her hands gr\nYeah a lotta people wear and you're you're you're getting justice one where you wanna get in a way an OJ was storming\nIncredible just incredible mountain to the evidence the mandate everything believe it's business card

gentleman who were driven them from the airport come straight over to me he was a very ... they were supporting Clinton but he didn't know what had happened to me even though he was a friend and he

said it but I didn't apply\nIt no you you literally set it\nYeah it does exactly word but I didn't apply it was an implied literally it was more than that he said it that's harder than an application oh my gosh he went\nAnd him can you imagine him and his brother their mom founded ... she's the co founder of La Raza\nThey're crazy oh my gosh I don't even know if that do we know if it was never fully on I don't even know maybe that's why they got\nGood night\nNo the ah who early on was the one who gave the twenty twelve keynote and that is one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to grant them watch it I said it years ago I've always had my I I've had my eye on them for years\nSo I'm telling you and his brother's us right now the ...\nThe former mayor and it was at that San Antonio river walk it they switched him out I still since my favorite one of my favorite stories out of politics and walking like I you know that we look alike and people were\nGoing and they were screaming at what they thought was who've and\nCastro but he had gone to a fundraiser he ducked out he goes to them well\nIt is it goes to you know if you put your identical twin in your

it's Joaquin but that nobody believes that [laughter]\n[noise] oh man I Would have thought I was there ever foreign policy analysis oh my word but yeah that he is they are\nLegit the they are the uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nAs who they are [noise] man\nSo that's just if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign\nAnd then you have the story a ... meter presents you with spending all that and\nHere's some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking why I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions\nSo power line had a great\n... a\nRite of of this\nAnd I think that again it's not a whisper campaign we're trying to find out information for instance there was a there is German media were saying that he was\nSince there was a there is German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or this operative\nAnd that he was a because of his association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in Islam is that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is totalitarian state\nAnd that he was bitterly opposed to their uh approach to the state of Israel and he backed up he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know back Palestinian cause he treated my dear America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nSo we know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually had the tweet saved so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much caution being used in drawing conclusions about all of this because the intel establishment I just don't trust them of the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're exaggerating I don't know if that's off if but here's the thing if he was a Middle East operative wind the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him in the New York\nTimes this is what I'm ... the New York times said about cars showed him\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing Collins to the Washington Post Palin asks why would the post enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself a contributing columns\nThe New York times described him as a quote political Islam is to quote forged a personal bond with President ... ... of turkey why would the post to use as a columnist and Islamic Powell over here to one\nAnd the New York times also added that according to the show the zone friends he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledged that he quote remained calm conversant and its conservative Islamic and often anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that was saying this by the way I wasn't and I have the link to destroy right here it it ran just on the fourteenth so that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that's the New York times to their credit\nLegit asking some questions or or putting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post\nHire this guy and it gets a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it a lot more complicated than just the crown prince run a couple of columns by some duty didn't like and decided to kill him\nI mean let's look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue I've just really don't believe that they did\nAnd if so why would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking and goes is links to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes into the dang consulate\n... he goes to the Saudi Arabian constantly and turkey is general and then you have one of your other guest who's always with you know the crown prince he goes in there shortly after\nThat is pretty brazen now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on this charm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I\nThink that I I I Do think that to a a a a particular\nExtent there is\nTo a particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugs it off\nBut\nI think that after this charm offensive there's more than than just\nHe's you know punch drunk on power there's more to it than this because you don't go to this you don't go to this effect this this links go all over the United states and you know show how you really didn't uh unveiling reforms\nWomen are driving your rolling back some of your your other regulations on you know said Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support a a ... the state of Israel\nI mean that's huge in the Arab world and that region that huge so why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like this was there a sense of urgency where's there's something else happening I mean that's one of the world went to that and I think that's a big question\n\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid\nBecause this was the New York times that was saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nNew York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud they run a profile of me actually like to report I thought she was much more professional than some of the other local not jobs who tried to do pieces on me and end up writing fan thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay\nUm but they're not even though there are biased and they make mistakes I don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was\nThe worst that's it and then on the conservative publication so power that's that's a narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign and I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that\nThere's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in a way of asking the bigger questions\nWhy would the crown prince gamble all of everything that he has built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe as the New York times had written that he was an Islamist here's associate with the Muslim Brotherhood and he was apparently working to have and Islam is all set up a author authoritarian state to
