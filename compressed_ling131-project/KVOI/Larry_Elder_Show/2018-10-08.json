hundred\nAbout ... percent have no doubt\nI thought it was bad back in Nineteen Ninety One and it's even worse today the political climate and how women are treated even and they and they need to climate you think it's worse now that was that I can only go by what we've seen over the past month\nThe next battle in the fight over Kavanaugh will be decided at the ballot box some Democrats are already promising investigations into Kavanaugh if they win control if he is on the Supreme Court\nAnd and the Senate hasn't investigated than I did in the house will have to\nRepublican Senate candidates in states Mr Trump won are now running ads hoping to sustain this base energy the Kavanaugh fight produced\nThe liberals me you know they're doing it again because what we have the most about Washington\nMeet all of the house where many of the tossup races are in suburban districts a growing number of democratic candidates are talking about gender and some are even making the issue of sexual assault part of their campaign\nI was lucky that I was able to fight my way out of it but I'm also six feet tall and I had I was walking with my keys between my fingers\nJoining me now is Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee or Alexander welcome back to me like a check to see 'em let me start by playing something Dr Ford senator testimony about her basic initial fear about coming forward and get you to react to hear this\nAt least calculating daily that the risk benefit for me that's coming forward and wondering whether I Would just be something in front of a train that was headed to where it was headed anyway\nThat feeling that she was essentially now being mowed down by freight train yeah well I you know I Can't put myself in her shoes but I can imagine that any\nAnyone who believes they were a victim of sexual assault first has to have to live within seconds the difficulties coming before a public audience particularly one that large must be terrified she said I Believe that did you believe her I thought she was credible\nWhat I had what does that mean do you what that meant was if if you're listening to her was all I had to do um I would've said she's she's seen\nTo do um I Would have said she's she seems to believe what she believes but that's not all I had to do for example this week I went down in the secure place where we could read the FBI reports I read six FBI reports between Nineteen Ninety three and twenty Eighteen\nHundred and fifty people interview about judge Kavanaugh in every case the interview he was asked do you know of any instance of alcohol abuse and the answer in every case was no\nThere was no evidence by any of these people of behavior that had anything to do with sexual impropriety so\nYou have to consider that mhm and you also have to consider the\nFact that the only person who remembers the alleged incident the doctor for describes his doctor for the other four said under penalty of perjury that is either didn't happen or they didn't remember it so you have to to\nBe fair about it in a very difficult case you have to consider that as well as sort of testimony\nWhen you think ended up happening why is that these things to remember that this when you think should just [noise] I have I I I I don't know if he or she said a hundred percent that she was getting a hundred percent whether it was ...\nBut I I'm sure that every sexual assault cases usually he said she said except in this case it she said she said they said they were the witnesses that she said were there all said it either didn't happen or they didn't remember it one of whom is one of her best friends\nWant to play something one of your colleagues Senator Murkowski who she ended up voting no here's what she said about this whole situation\nI Believe he is a good man didn't chase may be\nIt in my view he's not the right man for the court and\nI think that they're\nSafe way we need to be thinking\nAbout headed lady and you have to have our institutions\nAnd this is the I think the larger concern I think a lot of us are wondering about now and she also had her floor speech talked about\nWait a minute right so I'm guilty until that right\nLet me speak to that track if I can ... this is a confirmation hearing no one is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court it's not a criminal trial it's more like a job a hearing it's more like a job interview\nThe president has a whole series of credentialed unqualified conservative judges I'm from uh from among whom he could choose\nTo put someone forward to the to the Senate or the United states\nFor confirmation so if there are credible allegations against this particular nominee and if this particular nominee in his confirmation process conducts himself\nIn ways that they are real questions about candor partisanship fitness then I think it's appropriate for the committee or the Senate to say perhaps a different nominees the right one\nIf you're considering someone to be say president of the university CEO of a company\nI'm the host of a Sunday show and there are credible allegations against them it would make sense to step back and try and investigate them to see if you can resolve them that's why I was thankful that my friends Senator Flake took a tough step last friday and asked for an FBI investigation\nLet me get you to respond to something Senator Kennedy said to me earlier this week about when he believe things changed in this whole Kavanaugh debate tickle us\nI think this process changed dramatically [noise]\nUh when Mr ... the picture\nI think a lot of people including many of my democratic colleagues felt like that at that point\nWe had gotten into the foothills of preposterous\nHe was referring to a lawyer Michael ... who is a thinking about running for president who ended up representing somebody was allegations I have\nBeen seen as credible as the other two allegations do you agree with the political assessment there that that the ... entrance into their side show sort of a diluted everything\nI certainly like a Senator Kennedy said turns of phrase the foothills of the ... there's going to end up being a memorable phrase I I Do think that um he's correct that there was a widespread I'm response or certainly on the Republican side that these were not credible allegations\nUm I tried to focus my questioning of judge Kavanaugh on issues that were directly related uh first to his judicial philosophy his extreme views on presidential power and individual liberty and ways in which I'm convinced till overturned Justice Kennedy's most important recent decisions\nAnd then to focus on issues to fitness and candor um so I Do think what was important about the last few weeks was trying to find a bipartisan focus on facts and the larger question ... you know how do we move forward how do we heal the divisions in the Senate\nSo I take it if you're talking that way that the house Democrats are talking about re investigating cabin off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges coming from some House Democrats\nI I think that's premature I think you know frankly we are just less than a month away from an election of folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate um there's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point\nI'm isn't necessarily killing us and moving forward a check to send its role in our in our politics is not to just reflect the country but to help heal and leave the country and that's the course we should be on\nAll right senator Coons Democrat from Delaware things come out your in

contagious talk to somebody I Would put in that category they're also of course Republicans I Would put in that category as well\nAnd people have real doubts about what the role of the Senate is going to be going forward and you know there's a lot of people you can blame for that but your line of questioning about judicial nominees is really is really one of them and it started with the Democrats and Harry Reid when he took away the filibuster for those circuit court judges and it got lower when Mitch McConnell did it\nFor the Supreme Court nomination that I Wish I could sit here and say that I thought it was going to get better but I don't see it as\nWell look if you look at the Senate votes going back to Ruth Bader Ginsburg who received ...

about movie producer Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual assaults shortly followed by Ronan Farrow peace in the New Yorker\nOne of the people reading about one thing was the actor Osama law she set up this week and then went to sleep if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted right me too as a reply to this week\nWell she woke up to tens of thousands of responses and the realization she kick started the quote me too\nAnd I did actually it was founded in two thousand six by the activists Toronto Burke well both mulatto and Bert ... at the Kavanaugh hearings last week to support Christine Blasey Ford with mulatto easily seen on TV sitting behind\nAnd joining me now from Southern California is a list of laughter and from New York, Toronto Burke welcome to both of you thanks for coming up\nThank you so much for having us\nI'm trying to break let me start with you and you heard me play earlier the quote from Christine Blasey Ford where she talked about her fear of coming out and simply stepping in front of a train that was already headed to its destination um what are the repercussions of that\nWell I mean the repercussions are will be will remain to be seen but I think her stepping out was something that we needed to have happened in this movement it's been largely focused on Hollywood and on individual bad actors\nAnd I think her coming forward really set the stage for survivors to have a different role in this movement than we've seen over the last year a\nUs from a lot of the journalist Sally Quinn wrote in her memoir last year about an attempted rape\nBy a now deceased Senator John tower when she was a college student in the sixties\nWhen John Tower was nominated to be the defense secretary in in Nineteen eighty nine she was asked about it and she declined to talk about it with the FBI well a reporter for the New Yorker Susan Glasser asked her about it and let me play\nA let me show you what I'm Susan Glasser what she said I called Sally Quinn the night before Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to ask what she thought about her own experience all these years later\nAnd she goes I could have been Anita Hill she pointed out but I didn't want to I didn't want to ruin my life\nNothing has changed since Anita Hill not a damn thing she writes\nI think a lot has changed but I also think a lot hasn't changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning the cultural battle and often I don't fight for the when I'm fighting so that generations\nI don't have to deal with the abuses of power that that we've had to deal with so and ... and ... and I respect I think she is right but then I Do think that there's a lot going on and I think this this this cultural shift that we're feeling this collective pains that we're feeling from survivors\nComing forward it's going to be able to be translated into a collective power to say that we're not going to be silenced any longer\nTrying to work you know Susan Collins said that she was really angry at the leaker about this story that it put it forced Dr Ford into the public square maybe she wasn't ready or maybe it wasn't handled right\nUm do you think the United States Senate and in particular Senator Feinstein did didn't handle this correctly from the outset in may Dr Ford more vulnerable than necessary\nI wouldn't say she didn't handle it right she followed the leadership on the survivor people shouldn't have to be forced out of and to tell their story and so she acts for privacy I understand why Senator Feinstein decided to respect that privacy I think this is really indicative of how we don't understand in this country the life cycle of uh survivor\nAnd what it takes to actually mount up the courage to come forward particularly in a situation like this so I think it was handled five\nI think I Wish that after it was revealed an apple was linked with handled better\nWas Malone and get you to respond to what Emily Yoffe wrote in the Atlantic this week the problem with belief survivors\n[noise] she writes this even as we must treat accusers upstairs with seriousness and dignity we must hear up the accused barely and respectfully and recognize the potential lifetime consequences that such an allegation can bring\nIt believing the woman is the beginning and the end of a search for truth than we have left the realm of justice for religion\nThat's not what the new survivor's\nOkay what do you what would what what what is that me a note that Romney yeah when\nWe say believe survivor it's not believe them without investigation believe them without interrogation we have set a precedent in this country of not believing ups up thinking that women in particular are lying when that comport with his allegation when people come forward is allegation\nSo the ... the macho believe survivor it's about can we start with the premise that people do not\nOften lie about their pain and the trauma of sexual violence if we start with that premise doesn't believe that is true then you can have an investigation you can have an interrogation of the facts and that kind of thing is is not to say believe people blanket and don't investigate and don't do any um anything else besides believe them\nGo headache I I I also think that right now we are defining what due process looks like and this type of situation because we've never really defined as before because women haven't come forward so we do need to have due process what does it mean to have a fair investigation and these processes\nSo that we can move forward so that we can change the cultural and societal systemic\nInstitute ... station institutionalization of sexual abuse and assault\nWell let me get you a look when they get you to react to something Brett Stevens wrote in the times he said this I'd rather be accused of murder or friends said then of sexual assault\nAnd then he writes I feel the same way one can pick up excuses for killing a man known for assaulting a woman but if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself because it inflicts psychic familial reputational unprofessional harms that can last a lifetime unless I'll let you answer that first responders\nThese numbers are so low as far as false accusations and women coming forward there from two to eight percent [noise]\nThey ended up winning coming forward there from two to eight percent and that's\nNot taking into account that Seventy to eighty percent of sexual assault is actually not report it at all so what we're looking at is very very small numbers also there's not there's no grey area with murder right you don't like maybe ... you know\nCommit murder or maybe not you know there is very distinct lines that are drawn so what we're trying to do is defined what those lines are so that you know we can move forward\nA in a way that is not hurtful and not\nUm more in support of people that abuse their power than those that are being abused\nAll right I'm going to leave it there for now but a ... a lot of thank you both for coming on and a lot I Know you had to get up extra early on the west coast so I appreciate that you're thanks very by then we found out why Democrats\nTo win a lot more than fifty percent of the vote in November when back\nData download time Democrats of course hope to take out that you know about them and if they do they're going to have to overcome the advantage that Republicans have created for themselves through the process of gerrymandering which of course is drawing congressional district lines to create a partisan advantage\nAs a couple of ways to do it districts can be created by packing the opposing parties voters in a smaller number of districts or by\nThem into many districts to weaken their collective power in any one district so how does this play itself out\nTake the twenty sixteen congressional elections of the votes cast by major party candidates Republicans have less than a one point edge fifty point forward to forty nine point five that's pretty close must have been an evenly divided house right but an election night Republicans walked away with two hundred and forty one speech\nTo the Democrats hundred Ninety foresee that is a forty seven seat advantage\nDespite a only a one point or actually technically less than one point edge in the house popular vote now here's how that dynamic unfolded in the state of Pennsylvania twenty sixty\nRepublicans had fifty four percent of the overall congressional popular vote and ended up with Thirteen of Eighteen see the winner of the popular vote still capture the majority of the seats in Pennsylvania but due to gerrymandering you could argue maybe a few too many\nBut go back to twenty twelve and Pennsylvania Democrats actually held an edge in the popular houseboat statewide fifty one forty nine over Republican\nAnd yet because of gerrymandering Republicans were still able to capture the same number of seats Thirteen to be exact in this day but earlier this year this map was thrown out by the state Supreme Court\nSo with a new map in place but it's November's election the cook Political Report rates seventeenth currently held by Republicans in Pennsylvania as competitive with him for that they rate has actually leaning towards the Democrats right now those forklift the Pennsylvania delegation becomes more evenly split something the popular house boat will likely support on election I\nLook when Democrats are in power of course they do the exact same thing just look at the state of Maryland and how they did that but after the Republicans twenty tennis tsunami election they held the reins of many state capitals around the country\nAnd they got to draw most of the law that's why we should keep an eye on the elections for state houses and governorships this November because these are the folks here and twenty Eighteen

R. G. as many many many of you have and I'll be more than happy to help you in any way that I can you help to me and trust me\nI've got your back on this one of my whole family does so\nHard to believe that was a year ago that we were sitting around this very weekend waiting for the worst news of our lives it was just awful\nBut the best possible outcome and that in large part because of you so thank you All right\nOh in the Bible I did mention in the in the previous segment it was exactly one year ago that I sat in scope it wasn't I I we when we found out what was happening and armed American radio ... was about three weeks later when we knew of course of treatment when we knew we were faced with\nEt cetera is when I sat down with you and I talk with you about it and I'll tell you why I did that I Want to remind you of that again\n\n... was one year ago this weekend we got the news or were awaiting the news got the news on Tuesday it was about three weeks later that I opened up to you to tell you what had happened and here's why\n\nAs my wife and I sat in that room at the radiologist scared to death knowing something was coming back not knowing what it was\nIt was easy to say this can't be happening is this just cannot be happening is just not happening to us\nAnd I had to remind my wife during a conversation once you said this was in a quarter she said this is a nightmare it's just can't be happening is you know it it is happening\nAnd it is happening to you and it is happening to us and if you and us and we as a family are going to defeat this we have to accept what's happening you cannot refuse to accept the situation\nThis is the same exact concept that we speak about on this program together every single day even if we don't have to touch on it as a topic\nYou cannot begin to take your own personal self defense seriously if you do not first except that evil exists you must accept that evil exist in evil takes many forms we've discussed it over and over and over again\nAnd I just don't understand why people continue to vote themselves out of their rights and their freedoms I adjusted that is lost on me but I've been out of there and living in free America for many many many years I was a long time ago\nSo am I talking about New Jersey now because just when you think it can't get worse\nIn a place like New Jersey it gets worse and not only does it get worse it gets awful or is worst or\nI could make up words I can cause I was I Can't federal court upholds New Jersey mag band reminds gun owners importance of federal judges\nWe talk with Alan Gottlieb about this [noise]\nBut just as if you just you needed another reason to support judge Kavanaugh services it this is the stuff cases like this\nThat are going to explain down the road make it easy for you to explain down the road to your kids and their kids why it was so important that Donald Trump got elected when he got elected in why these pitch to the Supreme Court are so vital and so necessary\nIt was a September twenty eighth district judge Peter G sharing denied a motion for a preliminary injunction that would have been joined enforcement\nOf New Jersey's ten round magazine capacity she back on June thirteenth\nNew Jersey's newest gun hating freak show governor Phil Murphy\nHe signed a twenty seven sixty one that legislation altered the definition in the state of New Jersey of large capacity ammunition magazine from ... that can accept more than Fifteen round capacity\nDown to those that can accept more than ten\nSo owners you\nOf newly prohibited bags are now required to forfeit possession of your property within a hundred and eighty days or permanently modify their magazine German magazine to accept no more than ten rounds\nSo what are you going to do\nFirst of all I use that as an example again I said that was about cabinet\nImagine if Kavanaugh were seated when the perimeter case came up for insurance last year\nWhat do you think would have happened I can tell you with probably better than eighty five percent certainty that if Kavanaugh\nWas on that court\nThe proof case would have been heard and of course the ... meaning showing good cause concealed carry legislation we would have had\nThe good cause heard by the Supreme Court having to show a and a law enforcement officer that you can prove you have a need to exercise a constitutional right\nAnd then of course the ninth circus went farther and said that concealed carry is not protected by the second amendment\nIn a state referencing brutal was out of California that has no open carry\nNow say concealed carry isn't protected by the constitution if that's the case night circus what the hell is the second amendment\nWhy does it why is it there and what does it mean well you know what it means I Know what it means and then I'd circus knows what it means that's why they said that because they hate your right to keep and bear arms and that wasn't even a part of the case I can give you eighty percent certainty\nIf ... if not probably even higher than if Kavanaugh were seated on that court\nBack that we'd had a ruling on concealed carry by now from the United States Supreme court and it would have been in our favor that's why all the left you lose when left the bat satellite radio moment crazy loon on us over the last few days\nBecause they know these

G. you just heard me I'll get it on the air for you if it's a good one incident marking armed American radio dot ORG real quick staying on that hearing process Alan and we've talked with you over the last few months we know how comfortable you were with the with the selections\nAnd I'm sure you would be with the next one on the list that you saw as well and then having worked with the White House\nBut the process itself is so broken and the Democrats what they did was so violent so disgraceful I don't know if I were on that list that I'd want to go through it ... ... what kind of impact you think that's going to have going forward [noise]\nWell you're right you you put yourself out there and there's no doubt you become a target on your back and the Democrats go crazy will preserve a and and you know but it it it's a prized possessions being screened court justice so you\nKnow you get nominated it's hard to say no I'm not going to go through it uh but there's no doubt they'll throw in the kitchen sink plus law\nOr whatever it is not many especially if it's for gun rights or you know again I pointed out in previous shows with you mark\nThat the anti gun moving this country is W. hate and got on us because we're the ones who is possible for the states like you know uh you know Pennsylvania and you know a ... Michigan I those states that sound as blue states that went red\n... spots that are turned out a lot of independents Democrats that but they voted yes and then the first uh and that put Trump across the finish line in states like colonial victory or so they they're ... they want to get even with us more than anything because it's be upset their whole agenda\nIt's interesting when you were talking about the anti gun groups the professional gun prohibition is very well funded from Michael Bloomberg I Want to go to Michael Bloomberg and the next segment with you as well ah some state in the recently made that if you are I made we would be called racist for about what you hear him and just a minute but having said that\nIt it was very noticeable to me that while yes I saw some visible anti gun propaganda out there it seemed to me that the mainstream media focused more\nOn the whole wacko lunatic you know pink ... wearing crazy we're all gonna die or going into the back alley type fight seem to get more than the gun than than the anti gun or do you think there was a reason for that or was it just the other group of so vocal\n[noise] ah I think your polling data show that they were better off to push that one out front better than the gun issue with the upcoming midterm elections\nOkay that would make absolute perfect sense or polling data did come into an awful lot of play there a real quick let me just go to Bloomberg now because it's not something I Want to spend a lot of time on and we're while we're on the subject of him we've got a couple of minutes it turns out that on the fifth\nBloomberg was reported at a GOP USA and I guess uh they went to it from Washington Times\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued friday that guns need to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive while speaking at the Aspen Institute Bloomberg Seventy two so Ninety five percent of murders fall into a category\nA male minority between the ages of Fifteen and twenty five quoting cities need to get guns out of this group's hand and keep them alive the former three term ... said these kids think they're going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed they\nJust don't have any long term focus on anything it's a joke to have a gun at the joke to pull the trigger and he said something like this a couple of years back we talked about my gosh I Wonder if any of us said that we'd be racist all day long if serious about that\nThat he I think he is serious about it that's his elite is showing through a you know ... that demand and me and he really is a ... and if you're a minority you to like issue that is a guy that thinks\nHe knows how to run your life that you could run your own it really doesn't matter of our guts or sugary drinks I mean this guy is crazy I mean he ... he wants to cradle to grave take care of all of us in his banner his way give us no freedom period\nYou know I always found it interesting Alan will take this into the bottom of having to go into the break the next segment within a couple of topics but I always found it interesting just ironic\nTo me I found it humorous it was comical to me that while Bloomberg was the mayor of New York he was going after what you just said sugary drinks too much soda telling you people what to eat and here's this guy stands up at the podium and kicks off every year the Nathan's hotdog eating contest with these guys are seven Seventy five hotdogs down their stomach them after ten minutes\nAnd wash it down and they're serving all kinds of beer and soda and there he is up on the podium giving it a big kick off I always thought that was kind of ironic I guess if it if it brings money and attention it's okay but\nIf not just for you okay for me not for the type of thing with Michael Bloomberg always found that interesting\nBut I also find with is interesting because the largest fastest growing group of gun owners in America are minorities and you and I saw that together with the groups that we met with and hurt to speak at the G R PC twenty seconds to the break I'll let you take it away isn't that the case\nYeah we had lots of minorities people of color policy competent Chicago a A R R diversity is growing and of course that scares the antique enters as well uh yeah it it yeah I mean we're going to win this battle over time it's just we have to stay in the fight\nBecause out if they're successful here Arizona Florida I'm telling you those two states are right smack in the crosshairs maybe not Florida as much as Arizona but you got Nevada you're Twenty one ballot initiative states that they're watching here this is supposed to do with vital stuff I Can't I just cannot overstate it so what do ... do\nWell also Bloomberg is pushing for the other states don't have ballot measure initiative a laws to push us they can open up they get up and other states as well well well like you know anything about that but like vote no\nI I don't know sixteenth ivy nine that or\nVote no sixty nine that are make a donation helpless by less with advertising it's really important uh attack in our website in Seventy two that were what you all the groups the luckiest state citizens have the right to keep her arms well set up a coalition that go to vote no sixteenth every night that orange\nVote no sixteenth thirty nine dot org you heard that please please please go their vote no sixteen thirty nine dot org look I don't care if you're a gun owner or not\nBut if you value your freedoms if you value your freedoms you have got to oppose this measure and I you know honestly Allen\nIt makes me sick to my stomach to see what the media and I we all saw what the media did with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else this was the same type media that now you just said his burying when you've got three major law enforcement groups\nThese are people that people trust\nPeople trust law enforcement and they trust walk for Smith in Washington state Washington you listening on a number of radio stations now and throughout the Pacific northwest in neighboring states you\nTrust law enforcement and you trust what law enforcement says they oppose something that's a pretty fair bet that you want to look into it and probably oppose it as well I don't I I hate to see that the media is getting away with doing that but I I just I don't know when it comes to that kind of money\nAnd Bloomberg and an hour and then the rest of them out there you got a lot of billionaires [laughter] your neck of the woods\n... let let me give you a crazy show how bad this law as women say in Washington state licensed to carry concealed has a hard time getting their first catalyst is perfect illegal she comes home to her own house\nWhich the purse down on the kitchen table it again in it because the rescue she left in the kitchen and the first she now selling\nHold it hold a vote she carries it lawfully comes home puts it on the person use the drops of personal have uses the restroom she's a felon in\nOur own home\nOn sixteenth or not listener you're paying attention to this and I know what cause you're talking about Alan would you let listeners know why that is\nWell because the safe stores so called here you go to the law or ... it has to do it in her reach for she fell are now out on the street legal but in our own home it's not\nIf she gets followed home someone steals her purse off the counter\nIt gets followed home someone steals her purse off the counter or pushes her dad whatever picks her purse off of her she's now liable if that gun is used if she not\nOh she kept very large scale and in fact that they go out to her more than the criminals stole the gun so once you taking my buddy criminals stole the gun and that's just picking by by the state because she got her gun stole it\nHow how is this going to be enforced and obviously I I Know this is why law enforcement is not supporting us but how could this possibly being forced\nWell that's a good question I obviously they're not going to go house to house but in you know I it is and it's I guess those force it but by and large it's not going to be enforced is like a tribute to hit the tests to Washington state you know a ... five or ... Ninety five Ninety One I think it was\nUh the thing is that we've had two prosecutions in in three or four years now I Wonder if we can catch the last thing the lowest too vague prosecuted under and they don't get the prosecutor and the two is letting this anyway so millions and millions of dollars to spend on the ballot measure that Ollie harassed legitimate law abiding gun owners and there's nothing to stop crime whatsoever\nAnd I got to tell you I I'm I'm In a really good mood right now because I I don't know why I'm feeling like we're going to make some headway in Washington I don't know why I have that feeling but I just do I I'm hearing\nThings from people more so than I normally would about sixteen thirty nine and other issues I Hope that what I'm hearing\nMeans that we're actually going to get through to some people decide which ... thank you sir for everything that you do I'm going to cut you will not let you go do what you do on a Sunday thank you for everything you do Alan Gottlieb essay F dot org joined us lifetime membership a hundred and fifty bucks Rob Pincus will be here right after this don't go away\n[noise]\n\nAttention gun owner you're running out of time to claim your free lifesaving guide and your ... audio book if you want the truth about what really happens when you use your gun in the bedroom visit with the U.S these days breathe shocking true stories of self defense audio book\nAnd critical self defense survival guide you can finally protect yourself with the true don't you armed responsible dot com you get your right now you'll be amazed by the true stories of deadly shootings and violent attack but you'll be even more shock when you discover what happened after\nBecause making just one mistake can be the difference between freedom were jail don't leave yourself vulnerable with your green guided audio book you'll know when you can and can't do\nWhat to do when the police arrived and how to survive the legal aftermath Washington if you act now you also get a bonus W horse jak that's three lifesaving tools one hundred percent free but this is your last jam don't miss out\nGo to armed in responsible dot com right now that's armed and responsible dot com visit armed and responsible dot com\nYou have two minutes for a great tip concerning defensive firearms or the concealed carry lifestyle check out into the fray a weekly video blog hosted by Kevin ... editor of concealed carry magazine into the fray covers every aspect of self defense from legal and ethical issues\nTo the latest gear and tactics accurate\nDirect and easy to share with all your friends you can find every episode of into the fray ... into the fray video dot com that's into the fray video dot com\nThe second amendment foundation has grown into what many believed to be the most important gun rights organization in America with hundreds of\nThousands of active members is the second amendment foundation defending your rights in courtrooms across the nation winning these battles local jurisdictions all the way to the Supreme Court requires tireless Africa and help from you please help the second amendment foundation defend your freedom by joining or donating today an essay\nDot O.
