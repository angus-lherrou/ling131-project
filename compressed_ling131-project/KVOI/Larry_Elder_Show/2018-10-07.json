be true with his arms and legs so over all the ... kicks in one they haven't been six in one in a long time there tonight physicians\nCrazy congratulations go out to them and that is our number or a headline from friday [noise]\nNumber three highlight a friday night is press get upset Bradshaw mountain twenty six Twenty one scratch\nA mountain was ranked number shoe in for a in Prescott with numbers Seventeen do indeed it was a battle of rank teams and with that victory Prescott is now in first place in the Grand Canyon regions\nBranch I was trying to go and you know for the first time in the program since ... we've got plenty to seven in the game but Bradshaw rally to take a Twenty one twenty lead at half time but perhaps gets to feel goals and the second half for the difference in the game\n... gets defense played big and I hear ... gets quarterback often Clark ran for a hundred and thirty three yards as well in that game so congratulations to give up ... up a big victory their driver's seat in that region very tough region a so congratulations\nTo them salad do show threat quarterback for press get and that is your number three highlights [noise]\nDon't give up on Santa Cruz or the ... state champion runner up from last year pulls off the biggest upset probably of the night\nSanta Cruz came into last night's game rank twenty third and the two a wrecking had one in five records but the the the number two ranked Arizona Lutheran ah twenty seven Fifteen on the road\nA what a gay why those guys it's a very young team I think you only have like four or three seniors sorority only five years ... teams are very young\nThey've been in every game other than the Thatcher game but last night was the very first\nBig significant moment for that program and those youngsters this season I should say I'm a I have to cut up with regard Davis last night uh I think\nThis disease and they you know once they maybe one or two mistakes during games is you're rich are was telling me the young teens and young players with the you know what I don't think we're going to be able to pull it out but that was not the case last night so congratulations to Santa Cruz\nAnd they get it with\nRunning and strong defense and that's how you win games yes indeed the points sport is always a flashy and that attracts people but when it comes to getting those W you have to have the strong running game and playing good defense both sides of the ball that's where the difference was\nCoach David said the very key moment I gave was the filling out the very first play of their drive they snap the ball over the quarterback Arizona picks up the ball or other next to this and they make this court just now that all happened within the first twenty seconds of the game\nBut Santa Cruz to not panic after they stayed in the game they ran the or the next to this and rented dominant methodically like they're usually they're known for the run game running back hunter whole goal had a great game all the like as much only three seniors starters on that Santa Cruz seems to look for\nFor them to make a run here towards the latter part of the season and expect some big things also the next coming seasons for Santa Cruz that is our number two headlines from friday night [noise]\nAnd the number one highlights very simply is that true people service to the thunder they snap it six game losing streak against arch rival the mountain dew point pride with a twenty eight twenty seven victory and very simply Jose you mentioned that\nThis rivalry and series is dead even eleven up at eleven down ... enter the to keep all rivalry\nAbsolutely and there were some divisions there I think in the first half they had a chance to kick a field goal they decided to go for it I think like five seconds it didn't work out that in the final drive a maybe also another decision what maybe they\nShould have been for a field goal they went for it or through a nurse apps and in the end zone that's how the game is pretty much ended for for ... points but hats off to deserve it the uh the war without their started running back a Tyson grubs they're leading running back he's out with a high ankle spraying it sounds like but\nWhat a game Thomas jak to their defensive linemen had he was all over the backfield\nMouth point Parker and about or Navarro did a great job of managing the game last night for deserve it to like I said they didn't panic once they were down by seven nothing up ... points even did a great job early held desert vista but\nYou just saw it looked like deserve is gaining confidence in confidence\nThere were a couple of plays were they pretty much just lined up mano a mano ... down the choice in the neighborhood here we come ready or not and uh they ended up us yes they ended up getting those possessions could blame those position I think they scored a touchdown out of one of those poor down situations and uh I got to\nSay something about something happened on the sidelines last night\nA bright gas there are state commissioner facility for the night\nThere was a play there I think it was deserted to a receiver caught the ball one homicide life Brian uh you know had that big here in the ... his eyes were popped up 'cause he was going to the receiver going writer Brian [noise] but\nThat's optimistic yesteryear held on to drink\nI was right there the whole don't seem like he's about to fall down I saw hope Brian do it while I slept well last night wasn't injured hopefully we'll see a Monday after work over at the CIA officer so congratulations to service to congratulations Bryan holding on to drink\nSure and speaking up playoffs the Bastrop bears looked like they potentially could be headed there for\nThe first time in I guess I Can't really say in a while they had a losing record but got into the postseason a couple of years back last year they were absent from the post season but the bears after they're thirty five\nTwenty eight victory over the Hamilton huskies they're looking good in one guy who was really in charge of the ... last night very simply the quarterback good friend I was able to speak with him after the game\nI'm here with quarterback gay friends and very simply game congrats on at thirty five twenty victory over Hamilton spread the ball around tonight to found three different receivers for two days\nWell let me just a game plan all week 'cause you know all we know there are ... really are receivers go make plans you guys saw their DVDs and we just\nExecuted on everything we practice is really\nA lot of athletes on your team Canada maintain a tie for men just tell us about some of the speed that surrounds you think\nThere's teams just really explosive you have a lot of big play potential in a [noise] I think any any job we can go and his points on board\nComing into the sea venue and kind of failing basically splitting time but you press severe it and you're clearly the guy just tell us about your leadership in the locker room\nI just want to leave these guys you know have your heart should we go through and address the banter is uh [noise]\nThe last couple of years here at ... have been I'm going to say lean years but of course McDonald clearly is a guy who you guys have responded to you guys definitely like playing from tell about him\nHe's just came in and change the culture and destroyed or something to the program that we never had before on this last couple of years or other coaches and brought new excitement to football at all the kids [noise]\nHe said something at the end of you guys post game huddle that I'm sure you guys are very happy Monday at ... am as oppose it tomorrow or you don't have to\nWake up sorry tomorrow morning to watch him that a step back a trail Monday congrats thank you what\nAbout that and indeed the quarterback game friend of the\nVast repairs doing his thing but then also I was able to catch up with the\nHead coach Chris McDonald's McDonald's has done such a great job obviously he was once an assistant over with Hamilton but in turn he then took the head coach at a at coaching job in Maricopa and now he is leading his ...\nMcDonald you knew that this ... team was obviously you're going to come in and try to give you guys fits but he's certainly spread the ball around and your team is certainly game\nYeah it was a I mean we know it was a rivalry right and these kids grow up and they're playing football against each other planning on the same teams in youth leagues and things like that and um you know we we knew we were going to get their best battle you know ... regardless of their record and are coming into the game we were going to get their best punch\nGay friend is a guy who is obviously very solid behind Center You're comfortable with him throwing but he's also got some legs that you make use of\nYou know he he's um sneaky fashion he really is but I think what makes them really really good is is the fact that he knows how to run the zone read pretty well why does he does it make too many mistakes in terms of give her teeth you know and and I'm like I say sneaky fast [laughter]\nYou come in as me I'm going to say the third coach in three years but you've developed a culture tell us what it's been like to move up from Maricopa and just really immerse yourself [noise]\nI just really it's you know I think that's a that's a question more for the kids you know because at the end of the day they've got to buy into what to what a coach is trying to to to establish in terms of a culture so [noise] you know\nLike you just said the limited to you know I'm not certain that Charles for the seniors have to they didn't have to buy into what I'm trying to do they have to do that but you know what they did and I think we put together a staff that they know we can we you know the truly cares about them and let's just play hard you know and that's what it's about\nTo staff the beach Hamilton for the first time in school history yes it is and and um you know I you know I I spent eight years coaching at Hamilton so [laughter]\nYou know that I thought you know there's a lot of history there in terms of I had a ... a lot of really good times or that schools are really good school and and they'll get back on track couldn't keep up\nSchools are really good school and and they'll get back on track couldn't keep up the good work appreciate it thank you and that certainly was special to see the bears defeat Hamilton for the first time in school history\nIt's um anytime you see something like that I recall back in twenty Thirteen I got to see Chandler being Hamilton for the first time ever and that was huge so Chris McDonald has a lot to be proud of\nAnd I think he's really setting the school up for some success the\nCommunity has bought and the players have certainly bought and he has a personality that fits the area and the demographics of the schools so overall I I really like with Christmas Donald is doing and\nCongrats to the bears six wins in one last going deep into that premier region so it's a it's been good for South east Chandler\nOne of the big surprises yeah for sure one of the great coaching jobs two of the season\nAbsolutely yeah he gets my vote for coach of the year absolutely\nWell three Arizona quarterbacks guys that we talk about all the time Spencer rattler Jacob ... and Jack Miller\nThey were named to the national quarterback clubs mid season twenty eight player watch lists the winter the award will be announced during the national quarterback club award said the uh the Grand Canyon state gridiron club and I'll say Jose just overall\nThese three guys they certainly have exemplifies excellence and they have\nPicked up a a an auto obviously they haven't been fully honored yet well deserved we've been talking about ... percent sea\nFrom day one we've been talking about Jacob con ever from gate to hadn't jak middle or more or less ... three so all three of those guys just very deserving\nBig time accolades and also this award with some of those national quarterbacks and former NFL quarterback so being a being the presidents that that's huge\nYeah absolutely I think when we look back at this hopefully it's not just like three four year run for more than ... in Arizona but this is like a little golden age Iraq brought him to stay with the quarterbacks\nSpencer already you know the career leaving passer um but also the five eight six record holder for touchdowns a and\nMom very committed to retire on college schools\nYup and talking about Arizona quarterbacks uh we did a story in our magazine the pre season magazine about where Arizona ranks in terms of quarterback compared to other states in the nation\nAnd we were looking at it we're right behind California were right behind Texas only in terms of having the top fifty recruits in terms of quarterback from last year in this year's class\nSo ah yeah well I don't know if it's the water is how do you live in a training maybe a combination little bit of everything coaching the players as well\nBut a joy because it's quite quite a seed out

I think we play in the SEC west 'cause even corona they might only have one when they're pretty good yeah especially that a rookie pure salt kid\nYou know I mean we I think we got a pretty good defense and he made us look silly at times um you know some of our code name we can't tackle I'm like well\nWe can tackle kids who are going back to ... ... you know what I mean to go he was he was really good and we knew that\nUm and corona is just about to scrap the kids that that find ways compete ah they haven't quite figure out how to win yet and I think a coach backed off going to get them there and a couple of years so there you go\nLast year I got to see guys against a Perry and\nIt's fair to say that probably had their way with you in that particular game but overall you guys have I'm going to say I don't know if it's the best way to say matured from last year or two this year certainly a big improvement what's been the key factors from twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen\nUm I think the the biggest difference is that the\nUm I think the the biggest difference is that the ... it's not new anymore I'm so you know like are on the line they were all returned last year okay I'm pretty much our whole off into the returns from last year we have a few new guys on defense but\nLike the uh the expectation of what we do in the offseason the expectation and how we performed the weight room the expectation of what what are schemes are and the familiarity with what it is now um I ... so like you said maturing in a kind of the the highland hawk way\nUh I think that's been the biggest difference\nUm [noise] you know his last year everything was brand new I'm ... and in terms of you and brand new I was brand new uh and in terms of scheme it was kinda polar opposite of what highland has done over the past ten years and I and so a lot of that was new to quarterbacks receivers and what I was asked them to do and\nUh you know this year because of the familiarity and they've they've been in it for a couple of years now and they they believe that they can compete with anybody or\nUm I think that's been the biggest difference\nYou're an assistant coach over with the channels several years ago went over to shadow mountain to take their head job now back in the east valley with\nI'll end up going to say what did you take from those two previous stops one your head guy the other and assistance but an assistant on a program that she is setting records and has been dominant what are you sort of added to build highland [noise]\nAh you know really the I'm also going to talk about I my first stop was ... little Christian school in Virginia called liberty Christian academy and that's really where um [noise]\nI think most of my foundation was laid and there's a guy named Frank Rocco and uh\nHe he showed me how to deal with teenagers um and the fact that like uh if you can just it everybody kind of moving in the same direction and not have teenagers be apathetic but have passion for life okay um that that goes a long way and high school football\nUh anyway I respect him so much by Sunday after him or something's Rocco so it's really it really started there are but Chandler definitely showed me one how the east valley is just in terms of the\nYou know when like when I was ahead freshman go there for a year we had like a hundred players so it was like how do you get reps for a hundred years later you know what I mean a so just dealing with\nLarge school atmosphere large school hype and all that good stuff uh the pomp and circumstance all that all that good stuff and also\nJust being around a championship culture\nUm you know because there's a certain way that\nI'm good programs do things uh and and usually they do them at a high level all the time ... and how to use a competition within your team to\nTo build that a shadow mountain I Will be forever grateful I'm a ... a D back then and\nAh he he hired me taking a chance on some assistance from Chandler and I learned so much just about\nManaging teenagers that as the head guy you know when I got there when I got there it was after the school year got hot ended so I got hired in the summer technically\nOkay and our first game there was Eighteen ineligible players and they they were in as well because of grades at San ... nothing that I could have done and I was like oh boy\nWe got some work ahead of us so by the time by the time I hit my third year we had zero ineligible players ... everybody was getting it done in the classroom or you know we went from three wins defy when so\nAlert but mostly learned a lot just like how to\nManage a families within the culture of chatter mountain ... learning how to adapt me to different cultures different high schools you know you kinda gotta\nFigure out what's been the culture and the the traditions that are out each high school and you don't adapt what you want to bring to kind of what's already there and how you can kind of meld the two so\nThat I I learned so much and I will\nAlways be thankful for shadow mountains I'm but really to be highly man when it came available I was like that's that's the number one spot I Want to be uh just the culture of the\nOf the high school matches a lot of what me and my family are the are important in life in terms of just family values and I'm making a young man into great young men and not just winning football games so\nUm I was thankful that I became available and and that rod a\nHouston gave me a chance speaking with the head coach of the highland hawks\nRock feral and coach ... let's talk a little bit about a fence obviously you've got three men three different physicians share but when I think the hawks immediately I think of your senior quarterback Caleb Herbert I think a newer Burdick who are going to hear from a little bit and of course kind of call them or tell us about how all three jail\n[noise] um well again all of them were juniors last year um varsity and the biggest thing is like Kayla Herbert even though he's you know five ten fiery red head he he believes he can be anybody with what we're doing absolute um and so I think his confidence kind of ... through\nThe whole office um but it really starts with our offices why and we got one of our representatives yet a counter award camera grill him in the ... yeah it'll be fun um but it really starts with them and\nAgain just being different and we're gonna talk football here they they used to run power all the time which is a down block kick out gap scheme type\nA scheme and I brought in hey we're going to run inside zone they literally are allied coach didn't know how to run it our old why didn't know how to run it so last year that we all were kind of like they're all learning together in okay and the like I I don't know about this I don't know how it's going to go a and this year\nLike you can tell the ... the lime and know what to do and they they just keep friends own like right now is over dominate and so\nMy speed that was a big factor last year and I've kind of worked on that in me and Kayla by guards and closer together to get that connection and so as we've done that we've just hung out we've thrown a lot and that's helped out\nAnd it's certainly showed as far as the number of\nTouchdowns I'll ask get out I Would imagine the answer is yes I'm just tell us about how you are feeling even more comfortable going up against various defenders because the division you guys play in the sense division mountain points queen creek so Corona's desert vista obviously\nSome of those the bees are are there no slouch some of those guys are going to go very far but tell us about how you been able to really manage that\nUm killed does a good job and I just working hard all week in trusting in one another and when the ... games hoping when the game's going then it just helps out a ton\nI'll ask and I yes I Know your coaches here but is it fair to say that coach makes the practices harder this way the game becomes a little bit easier\nYeah it is but he also makes practices fun and exciting so that it's um when the games come around and we're focused but we know what we need to get done\nAnd much like I ask kind of tell us about you being a leader in the I was going to see the clubhouse the locker room just as far as instill in your experience\nUm well we need a lot of help from the juniors and sophomores and even the freshman they\nUh they've been doing great the season and so just talking to the freshman during their games helping them out with anything they need even not only on the field but in the classroom anything they need\n'em every Wednesday cuts frail has installed this thing where we go and mentor a kid from Jay being a kid from the freshmen oh very cool and so just asking anything we need their grades any classroom stuff and also on the field getting\nIf they need help with anything and selling coverages or a routes whatever they need so we're there for them\nThat's outstanding and I'll ask you also a year from now where would you like to be\nUm I think I'll be out of ... some university I don't know where you're at and then much like caller I think also the LDS mission\nOutstanding let's move over to the defensive side of the ball Monet west they are\nNo guard for the highland talks\nWe talked so much about our fans than how the ball is moving but you are a key caught on defense defense wins championships there's no doubt about that tell us about your senior year and just the team and I always I'm looking at some of these\nSenior year and just the team and I always I'm looking at some of these scores you guys had the big zero against bashore but overall tell us about how you guys are jailing\nOverall I Believe that um [noise] I Believe that our defenses doing pretty good lady I Know we've got some rough spots that we can always fix it's always in every team and I know that\nOur defensive line of defense at all it all comes down to our relationship to each other we have a lot of things in our and our team a Reagan bond with each other and talk to each other it's just like the barbecues before games and and all that stuff and I I really feel like a relationship with her with my personal view line as good as one of my closest guys and the team\nThat's very good if you could expand a little bit about what was said about the uh the mentor program because that's something that and we've myself and Jose we've been doing this for a while I've actually never heard of that at least I'm not in a direct foreign but tell us about taking kids under your wing\nAll right so are are mental program we got every Thursday is every Wednesday we do ah\nWe just get grades from our players you know you get assigned a player from a freshman and Jay being me go and pull their grades from you're going to talk to him about it after school who just kinda hold them accountable things let them know how they can fix stuff and slim know how to be by players\nOutstanding and what is one of the things that you personally wanted to work on from your junior senior year\nWell from my personally I'm a junior right now so okay so how how okay so from my sophomore year I personally winding um increase my strength because from my position is Berea aggressive position you've got to control to be able to beat the center\nSo personally I Would was really trying to increase my strength and I I personally I didn't do that and\nThat's that's one of my key things get faster stronger\nOutstanding and I mean you guys definitely are a very cohesive I mean I Can't say enough about with coach Farrell has done with the highland talks and\nObviously you guys don't really listen to the headlines and knew or should do but I can certainly say that there's a lot of people out there who are rooting for you I'm going to use the term it's\nThere's no reason to hate on highland I mean you guys do a lot of things you write you guys are are you guys are well like thin so overall just very good stuff and as we start to wrap up the second I'm just going to do a quick round Robin\nJust sewer some of the people in your corner whether it's your parents' best friends people who have really made you a young man that you are now\nI'm a strong person that really makes me personally I was my brother he likes ... his ... and the ticket was numbers here the same numbers me from SUNY graduate in another\nOne's here at like a private mentor he had a family that are you okay good stuff you know same thing has been in your corner and then we'll get caught or over here as well um I think my parents have helped me a ton\nThey've just kept me on track and they um helped me do what I'm supposed to do and make sure I'm On on top of everything I Need to be so my parents have helped me all the time\nOutstanding and kind of war and I'm blessed to know your parents obviously they've been there for you but I'll let you elaborate [noise]\nUm yeah definitely just my whole family I think um they make an effort to come to every one of my games and in my extended family they're all they're always um let's see my biggest example is probably my older brother breath and I'm\nA just how talented he was a football and then making a decision they made to go to every mission leave that all behind um I think is a great example of how to work hard and where your priorities should be to the so\nOutstanding yeah last but not least let's bring back coach feral because you guys have a by we can you guys have a very well earned five week coach feral are these guys get a get some rest next week how's practice going to go before your uh your next game in two weeks\nSo actually yes I'm R. R. A. D. planet perfect we're actually an fall break right now like OK friday was a half day for these kids and uh so they they have a full week off from school or an addict coincide with our by week on purpose or\nSo because of that really the three of the only three or doing anything for football today okay I they have today off they have Monday often they've Tuesday off and then we'll come back on Wednesday and treat Wednesday like we normally do on a Saturday um and so\nJust looking at it we definitely needed the rest um you know football is such a grind like the same thing every week you know every Monday practice is the same every Tuesday prices at the same and\nI'm as much as I Try to mix it up it still is flat out Brian and I could see it on the all these guys faces and okay uh so the by we came at a perfect time I'm On what all of us to feel healthy and strong as we make his push to end the regular season into the\nPlayoffs and coach I'm sure that you feel blessed great family but also mentioned a couple of ear or assistance I Know coach Mack the marriage has been very influential on special teams who is your support staff both on and off the field\nI'm off the field definitely my wife and kids uh my wife Hanna is she's not just the wife of a coach she's a coach's wife and I don't know I don't know if anybody really knows the difference except for other coaches why that's fair um but she is just fully embrace the process uh she's full super supportive I'm\nPretty much you know say it it's pretty much just a single mom with all of our three kids uh and I I Do my best to to be where I'm supposed to be what I'm supposed to be there um but she but she gets it which is which is awesome [noise]\nUh and then my three kids encounter Rocco they they are all in on highland a you know like nine and she's got her heart sweat suit undoing cheers and all that good stuff so\nAh and actually my son usually kicks with often the entire here but I'm sure he has no idea what the score is because he just kicks in the net with often that's the whole game [noise] ah so that's off the field but are just some of the coaches that have been great uh since I've been here um\nArguments coordinator ... he's he's a a a young coach but\nUh he was our JV deepest corner last year and I watched him\nIn his preparation just for I put him in charge of scout defense in our playoff game and they'll rally racing that he put to be in charge of the scout defense was enough that I said he deserves a chance um and and he's done a great job you know his his preparation is", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "07"}
