[noise]\nThe Sunday Morning as our colleague journalist ... wrote on Twitter late yesterday the worst anti Semitic attack in us history took place today just days after the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history but that thinking\nIt's a deeply unsettling assessment that has the disturbing advantage of being accurate this after a week of ethnic violence and political tear on friday a Florida Man ... was arrested and charged with sending as many as fourteen mail bombs to Democrats and other critics of President Trump\nAnd justice of the country tried to exhale as the male bombing danger seem to have passed we learned yesterday the horror in Pittsburgh where a lot of\nPeople were shot and killed a ... a synagogue and the city's heavily Jewish world film they last night there were numerous\nVigils around the city in the country including this one in Pittsburg near the synagogue and remember victims and our hyper partisan atmosphere\nWhere we will inevitably today was the male bomber inspired in catalyzed by President Trump\nWho kept his political opponents enemies of the people or was he just alone are filled with anger and political resent that was the synagogue shooter\nA product of a toxic environment on the right that treats refugees and Americans who don't look and worship as they do with other or with this type of hate filled mass murder we've seen too many times in this country before\nWe got both of these stories covered plus we're going to look at the amped up political rhetoric that serves as the backdrop to this year's midterm elections just nine days away but let's begin with my colleague in the senior justice correspondent Pete Williams will hopefully have updates force on both of these stories peak warning\nGood morning Chuck will uh Bowers is now going to phase Robert Bauer is the uh the convince the alleged shooter in in Pittsburgh is going to face Seventy two counts now he's been charged both by the federal government and by the state\nThat has no place over correct well they they both filed charges so I I think it's not clear who where he's going to go on trial first but the federal government was very eager to step in and say this was a hate crime\nAnd justice the Pennsylvania authorities have said and there seems to be very little doubt of that for three reasons basically one is that social media postings I'm months and months of of a vial anti Semitic comments secondly the fact that he singled out a synagogue and speaks for itself and thirdly the police in Pittsburgh say\nAs he was being transported to the hospital as he was being treated for his wounds he said all Jews must must die because they are committing genocide against my people\nDid he ... who who does he referred to as as his people and not taste who knows I mean that's that's what he told the police as they were treating him on the way to the hospital\nThere was other than his whereabouts over the last year there's not much known about Mr ... ... or that is that what what what profile are they able to drop so far\nNo you're right and if you contrast the to hear Caesar say oc are accused of the bombings uh the sending out the package bombs he had had many run ins with police over the years he even made a bomb threat against Florida\nPower light over one of his power bills at one point on the other hand power seems to have absolutely no contact with law enforcement they said he was never on their radar before he was a loner neighbor say he never got out much you seem to have his life seems to have been led on line and I think one question is\nHow did he ever visited that synagogue before did he know the lay out of it because you know ultimately it ends on the third floor that's worth a shootout with police as if he's trying to hide from them\nAnd did a is there any indication that he purchased any of his guns illegally when they purchased legally\nNo there's no indication that he bought anything illegally and I think one question about his weapons is this ... many of the witnesses said they thought there was automatic weapons fire well you have to assume that these are people who don't spend a lot of time listening to gunfire but the police say it sounded like automatic weapons fire so I think the question is\nDid he modify that semi automatic rifle it's possible to do it it's illegal but then he modified in a way that would shoot automatically or was it using a bump stock like was used in Las Vegas shooting I let's move to\nA Caesar say are as a a friday he was not talking a is a is there any update on whether he has yet to cooperate with with officials\nNo and in their ability to question him now or is is reduced he's going to have his first court appearance on Monday they they initially question him under an exception for the Miranda rule you know normally you have to buy some of their rights before you\nCan question them if you want to use that evidence in the trial against them but there is a public safety exception and that's what they used here basically saying are there any more bombs well he refused to say a whether he had anything to do with the ones that were already out there or be whether there were any other still waiting to be discovered it's been what thirty six hours now since they found it\nWas just going to say at this point I Can't say I noticed that the postal service won't say definitively yet at what point will they feel comfortable assuming that it's out of the system\nWeek maybe a you know they had been finding these closer and closer to the mail system or the last ones were discovered inside the mail system so\nCarefully looking for them and I think you have to assume that there aren't any more because this is the longest gap that we've had since they were to anywhere discovered and all the ... late once discovered where west coast so it's sort of make sense that that might be so the assumption has got to be that right the last two two Senate sent to senator Kamala Harris and attempts dire\nAlright tense a top tier Tom sorry Pete Williams a than an awfully tough and busy week for you for all of us thanks

and Erick Erickson editor the conservative website the research and the president last night\nI played for you the one soundbite he said about anti Semitism\nAnd he said that at the top of his remarks and then he went right back in to rally mode Amy Walter take a listen\nHow about the Democrats [noise]\nLadies and gentleman speaker Nancy Pelosi for that\nAnd they continue to have these foolish and very stupid people\nI can go above God says that any more but I think I Will anyway you might\n[noise] this moment with President Trump he seems to be struggling with it\nAssist the motives that he's been in since he was a candidate\nPolitics has never about nuance zero sum game when you are campaigning it's us or them find airing but when you become an elected official suddenly become depressed the United states campaigning is supposed to stop for a while and you go into the mode of unifying\nThis is the president has never been interested in unifying here it's been interested in keeping his base engaged and enraged and he's done an amazing job of that but\nHe believes that it's still in the middle of the campaign\nThe other thing I Want to bring up just with all of this writ large is you know what their country's long history of division losing American who's not seems to me the time that we're in right now what I feel like is no one is taking any responsibility for any of this\nOh it's not the gun law it's not our fault with guns don't kill people killed right it's not our fault who posts on social media don't blame us in social media like he'll do that I blame someone else\nIt's not us our political leaders ... you know people are doing these things with out that they just have a history of mental instability it's not about what we're saying to them no one at all is raising their hand to say you know\nWe played some role in this and we have to be able to fix it so it's always somebody else's fault when that's the world we live in is never going to get better and walk or\nI I Know everybody everybody when you go to the president says what about this what about what what about this and I would say there's only one president that's right there's a day in fact that\nThey don't the response within the White House and I spoke to a number of officials is look everyone bears responsibility\nAnd when you put that question to them squarely look he is the president he has the loudest microphones doesn't he bear the largest responsibility they say well he has changed some of his rhetoric he has struck unify no but remember on friday check he was asked if he's going to tone down the rhetoric he\nSaid no he thinks he can actually turn it up now that was prior to\nYesterday's tragic shooting but I think Amy really hits the nail on the head which is that White House officials say this yes he feels like he needs to have a unifying notes at the same time\nWe are ten days out from the mid terms and so he knows what he needs to say to fire up his base and a lot of that rhetoric is divisive that's the bottom line\nTurks and David French wrote this and said you know what they'll call this person crazy referring to say he's an anger angry obsessive and that there is it\nThe language did matter and he writes that not all listening here's a sober minded are entirely rational and when they hear a public figure they admire fund or against his political opponents of extreme language sometimes they they'll take extreme action in response to says David French putting some of the burden on the part\nI think so um I mean the problem I have with putting the burden on the president is how much do you put on him and I think a lot of people want to put a lot of the burden on him where it really does belong on the American people as a whole\nI'm the president is the American comments section of the White House\nAnd he is the president who does this we're not going to change this president what can we knew the changes that people if we're not going to change the president\nI think aims right no one wants to change but the fact of the matter is this was larger than the president society is crumbling around us politics has amplified at the president's amplified it but there's something going on in society as a whole ah that is translating into politics and the president is not the cause he's a symptom\nHe's the president Joshua he is only one true that the president bears part of the responsibility a significant part of the authority for the tone of the country\nIf I Will say I do have a fair amount of hope\nComing out of this and I know it seems very bleak but I find a lot of hope and younger people that montage she played in the first segment a program that got girl with the cool future hair and she was one of the organizers of that gathering data on squirrel hill she got on Facebook\nAnd helped bring people together to just come talk I got a tweet from a guy who I think is in Wisconsin who says I combat the heat of the world by coaching high school debate\nThey learn to see both sides of an issue and how current events relate to real life there was a poll that came out from Cuba recently that found that the younger you are the better you are able on line to discern factual\nStatements from opinion statements if the older people like generation thrown up the baby boomers claim them but I'm not saying ... frankly I Know it I think it's it's the generations and I'm just a generation removed who have grown up with the advent\nOf social media who haven't been able to navigate at our kids having watched our example now the question is whether we will be the queen thing to them a nation that yet remains connected whether this is the beginning of another\nCultural civil war but I come out of this worried but also hopeful that there are people who are taking responsibility for this look what happened after Parkland look what's happening now off the scroll hill there is a generation ready to leave but the question is what will they be leading what\nI'll tell you somebody who's not hopeful Charlie Sykes former talk radio host\nHe wrote this in the Weekly Standard the result of course is familiar in across the board refusal to engage in any meaningful self examination refusal to acknowledge the failures in your own tribe while insisting we let let's say on the malignancy of the other tribes its hatred violence that apparently bottomless capacity for deception of trickery so this will get worse sorry Joshua we\nWell Chuck first off that that simply not true but look with the concerns that that a woman hat and in Pittsburgh look another census active haters strict in yet another community and a place of worship in the United states of America\nThe Congress has a responsibility to act\nTo keep people safe and it's not too much to expect leaders to bring us together to unite our country or to find a way to reach out to us toward greater good and make sure that we rise above all of the accusations and the hate and the finger pointing\nCheck so I Am certainly hopeful that we'll see that out of uh the leader of the free world and that will see that out of each and every one of us individually as well as our colleagues\nI and I would like to say I'm proud of the way then responded when Steve skull east was shot I mean we didn't blame Bernie Sanders when Steve ... was shot we all came together I think we can all come together now or it may take us about nine days for that to happen but I think we can all come together now\nWell I Want to read to yourself and Dan Balz start today though Steve is an added layered because today\nWell I Hope that I Hope that the finger pointing will stop and we can come together I I Believe we need to come together and then\nI have to tell you I actually think Dan Balz or is the perfect person to insert into this because he writes the following this was a time of the politics of the apocalypse\nAnd all or nothing and knew the difference between winning and losing an election and holding power or not holding it politicians say that it's time for the country to come together as you to just did but on who's terms I think that is the issue comes on\nWhat this coming together mean to the Democrats\nAnd then I'm going to ask the same question to Congress and diverse I'll start with the cops and the law\nWell look it's making sure that we're able to reach across the aisle and we can work in a bipartisan basis for Democrats have been clear about is if we're fortunate to win back the house which I Believe we will that we work immediately on lowering prescription drug prices for the American people\nThat we work on a bipartisan infrastructure package to make investments across the country and that we work together to clean up Washington DC\nTo find ways to overturn Citizens United to address gerrymandering or to improve or an increased transparency and disclosure across the government to restore faith in our political process those are all areas where we can work together and reach across the aisle and find some common ground\n... what does it mean to you why do I think I Do think\nWe need to come together or not on anyone's terms but on America's terms we're Americans first\nI agree with them that infrastructure is something that we all need and we need to come together on lowering prescription drug costs I'm not sure why didn't talk about lowering healthcare costs we need to come together on lowering healthcare costs are and I think we can do that we need to listen to each other\nOr no matter who takes the majority are and I think we're going to hold the majority but no matter who takes the majority it will be a ... a razor thin majority and hopefully that will mean people will come together Republicans and Democrats to get things done\nBut I Do worry about the you know making sure that we do it in a way that we're focused on getting things done not on just abolishing ice\nOr doing the things that are on the extreme\n... Congress insiders I Want to ask you about an ad that you're running um last week one of the people targeted by the pipe bomb or a a assailant was a George Soros here as a part of an ad that you're running in Minnesota against the Democratic candidate there named Dan thin I'm paid for by the interests I enter cc take a listen\nBillionaire George Soros bank loans the resistance than than seeing the un's employed by just sort of one of the liberal outfit in DC his campaign from them by other states superPACs back by ...\nLook at who finance is Dan ... employer radical George Soros most of the biggest banks are crooked lobbyist tied to pollution they pay the ... fund his campaign\nWhy do you talk retro ...\n... you know there are independent expenditure arm is independent um but uh you know that ad is the actual uh and uh you know it also um it has nothing to do with a a calling for violence in that ad is is a factual and\nCongressman Lou on uh do you believe that they're they're attacking folks of big money you guys do it too I guess with the Koch brothers and things like that are are we inadvertently putting\nPutting people private citizens in the in the crosshairs of politics that don't need to be\nWell look you see but I think on all sides we need to evaluate how people are being targeted um even this morning Kevin McCarthy pull down a tweet\nWhere he was targeting a George Soros as well as Tom's tired and a few other leaders like Mr Bloomberg across the country um I think that both committee should begin to look at how they operate into the future and what's going on even during the rest of this election cycle\nBut look we built a strategy at the D triple C surrounding our candidates talking about their personal stories and records of service men and women who have served the United states in the military or CIA officers FBI agents\nPeople who have committed them their cells to keeping our country safe and we're going to continue to run ads that are telling their positive stories where our candidates are connecting with the American people\nLet me ask you both been your ads in in Colorado and in Washington had been called sleazy and personal attacks I mean I bet it happens on both sides we've probably both need out how to clean things up but it's it's that's affecting them that we're not off that the media call him that let me see by running\nWere running were well hold on check on that go ahead Steve you've you've also been running racist ads\nIn New York in ... in Cincinnati, Ohio and out in California you can do something to pull those down and I just think on all sides that everyone should monitored their tone here again no more finger pointing Steve I'm sure that we look within ourselves and we find the greater good there ...\nI I agree with you Ben but let's let's both look within ourselves\nSteve directly men right out on a a Congress in ... very right it may be nine days before everybody is willing to to sort of calm things down but let's hope there's a little more calm before the next night I have a check we are today you should then\nAll right I Will let you by the way they're Steve we should I Hope I Hope everybody is safe and the campaign trail over the next time tonight on them and thank you both for coming on when we come back we'll check\nA lot more people are voting early this

Lott\nCrime research dot org and very quickly ... gives you some of his books that you're what you're going to want to read the war on guns army yourself against gun control but I think I've told John on the program before I one of the best books he's ever written as far as I'm concerned I've got to mark up like a like a kids' school book\nI Love it a more guns less crime course third edition of biased against guns and on and on you can find all of their crime research dot org let me go back over to John's Twitter page and want to play the ... today Dr John box thoughts\nOn the mass public shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue entertain you hear what John spots on this for a minute thirty second cyclists\nAnother mass shooting our hearts go out to those who lost loved ones in France today at the Pittsburgh setting guarded chair\nThank God we have a president who understands what can be done to stop these attacks that these killers purposely seek out those places were victims aren't allowed to defend themselves big gun free zones service maintenance for these attacks\nThat virtually all of these mass shootings key by taking place in areas where victims aren't allowed to defend themselves\nWhen he signed up in front of schools churches and synagogues worn killers the victims might defend themselves we need to have them have permanent concealed handgun so that the killers don't know who it is it might be able to go and stop\nThe guy today said that they could not afford year round security that it was just too expensive they that they can only\nHave it at high holiday\nWell oh I Want people to carry permit concealed handgun is one way an inexpensive way to go and solve that people need to understand the dangers of these gun free zone that these countries don't make it a trap for people to be killers to attack\nAnd it makes it easier for them to go and kill people\nJohn straight up common sense to me and I've known you a long time and I can hear the frustration in your voice when you were taping that am I right where you you sounded frustrated and you sounded kind of angry am I right\nI mean I Want to try to do something to stop these attacks and I don't\nKnow how anybody can look at how these killings keep on time after time picky targets were victims aren't able to defend themselves\nYou know just a couple of days ago last week it was a mass public shooting or what could have been at last public shooting at a Kroger grocery store\nYou can touch and everybody from meet the press that Jake Tapper on CNN brought that up today\nJake Tapper on CNN brought that up today a but what they failed to know in any of those discussions is that it ended because a concealed carry permit holders stop the attack are there\nAnd so you know these guys are they ... they use the quote on the shows about you know don't shoot me I'm a white guy white guys don't shoot white guys but they don't put that don't shoot me part there they they don't\nPut obviously the killer who is out there killing Black Sea was stopped by a white concealed carry permit holder\nOr when he saw the permanent holder was pointing his gun Adam and ordering them to stop he ah he made those comments but his first comments were you know don't shoot me and and you know I I guess you it is amazing bias\nThat these guys could bring up this case today multiple times and no one wouldn't mention that it ended because there was a permanent older you know at the same time they're attacking Trump on these shows\nFor somehow believing that letting somebody have a concealed handgun if the Senate guy could have save lives\nAnd you know I Know they realize that they brought it up and contacts there would be hard for them to go and criticized Trump at the same time during the show\nAnd just getting on another example I was just reading the New York times or from today a earlier and are they talk about Trump's discussion about gun control laws as an assertion\nOkay they use the word search and they don't do that for the Democrats were talking about the need for gun control laws in the same article\nAnd you know these guys have such blinders are with regards to the you know as you say it's common sense to me but I was chief columnist for the United states sentencing commission\nI must have read through a thousand trial transcript and I have to tell you no one can read through all those criminal cases and not come away with the view that these criminal\nFly pick easy targets\nYou know they maybe kooky or dumb or whatever but they're not so stupid\nThat they don't try to take easier targets in the same thing is true with these mass public shoot it they may be crazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people as possible\nSo they want to go to a a a venue where they know victims are going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nTo somebody at the same to a ride with a gun and the more people they're going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because on one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they are they called for laws that either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm\nYou know these gun free zones that one is that all of that and yet when a when these attacks occur they want to posture as all people who are willing to do something well my response says yeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something\nThat actually matters it wouldn't make people safe you know\nThere's so much meat in what you just said I could take the rest of the hour with ... quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was from talking to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on our directing radios daily defense tomorrow in fact and probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page you can follow him\nAt John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page\nBut he points out Stephanopoulos doing the same thing at ABC and they just eliminating the fact that a white concealed carry permit holder and the attack and he goes on to tell you in a tweet in comedy which do with it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves blacks from shoot I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener\nYeah I'm I'm with you on that one I just simply I Wish I had the answer to that and I'm trying to if you're absolutely correct It's very difficult to get into somebody's head or somebody's heart but I I just sit there sometimes and I think I Am I the only person that\nSees this guy telling me the guns aren't the answer is surrounded by armed guards I you know I\nI I don't know I I put it right up there with Leonardo DiCaprio flying on a jet telling me that I got a problem with my carbon footprint I mean the whole thing to me is is just absolutely laughable and sickening or let's go back to if we could some of the homicide numbers and statistics I find this fascinating\nBecause we see lots of different numbers people spin about all the time oh the u._s. ranks number one you\nGuys have the worst mass shooting right in the world the homicide rate in America's if more people die by gun violence in America than anywhere else in the world you lead the world and it's disgusting you just need to repeal the second amendment and get over that was Vermont skits\nBut that's not true and I've seen everywhere from us ranks anywhere from first to Ninety second when it comes to this where do the numbers actually fall\nRight well I mean I have a very long discussion about the some of my book the war on guns are basically give you a rough idea about this stuff\nLook um when you look at the data for all countries around the world or the United states in terms of homicides ranks below the average and it ranks below what we'd say is the media which is kind of the halfway point half the country has or above and below\nIt we like rank even low or if we knew the truth data some of the worst countries don't and report a homicide rate data\nAnd even some many of the ones that do report it lie you know it's not just Chicago and Philadelphia which have had histories of of tampering with a murder data you know there are many countries around the world Venezuela others that we could name a which\nHave you know taking it to even much greater extremes\nAnd I'm a and the other thing is uh most people think that homicides and murders of the same or not a most countries don't attack almost no other countries outside the United states a couple of the places report murder rate or\nIf there's a big difference between a murder or homicide is that homicides include justifiable homicides the United states has relatively more justifiable homicides than most countries\nBut it seems to me you shouldn't be including though there is a big difference between\nSomebody killing a victim and let's say a civilian who is trying to stop this up from being raped or police officer who is trying to stop the cry\nFrom occurring uh uses their gun to go and kill a criminal those are two different cases and I'm not sure I really want to like the two together but putting that aside\nMost of the comparisons that people may around the world involve firearm homicides and appeal that firearm homicides will way higher or much were well above the media were pretty close to the average um but there's a reason for that and that is not is that in that is\nAbout half the countries in the world don't report firearm homicide data they report total homicide did\nSo the reason why we look so bad when it comes to firearm homicides has just you've removed all the top countries from the rains there is one reason why gun control advocates like to always put the discussion in terms of firearm homicide rate across country and uh [noise]\nUm so are you know it's\nYou know there are other issues I can go into but ah you\nKnow ... that's a good that's a good place to stop because the clock is ticking down on us on this break here we've got one more segment but I it's interesting to me too because I Want to ask you about something else when we come back and then we always hear the term out of developed nations\n... of all the developed nations in the world and I get to thinking well what about his Brazil developed nation is Mexico developed mission wire that act seems almost raises to me\nWhat about all those that don't their lives matter why don't those statistics count a country as a country as a country and those numbers are numbers are numbers don't want to ask you about that when we come back to and then I just I don't want to give some predictions from you if we can in the last remaining segment last few minutes that we have back with John Locke right after this don't go away\n\n\nAnd\n\nThe magic you're walking through a parking lot at dusk your with your children as you approach your car you see a large manned

they can't even tell the truth about what they do less people find out and decide hey I don't want that asked that poll Mr ... leave just told us about reveals Allen\nShould we be concerned about these numbers\nYeah we'd definitely needs to be concerned about these numbers numbers mean number of dollars that the uh opponents of gun rights are spending because it's going to impact ballot measures candidates for public office\nAnd you know overall it it has impact public opinion as well and we now have more anti commercials running on TV or in a in ads or then you'd have program was running for the first time in history over time that there is taken advertising toll\nUh so the bottom line is is that you know we need to worry about that and it's really hard I got to wait for us to compete with it is they're getting money from several billionaires a year where they write hundred thousand dollar two hundred thousand dollars a million dollar checks\nAnd I just don't have anybody like that and neither does the n._r._a. really I mean this is a problem when you get you out and figure out soon\nYou're right and I have and I will say it again publicly I volunteer to be the billionaire that helps I'm working on that I'll let you know how I may go take a listen this this statement from the n._r._a. spokesperson Jennifer Baker concerns me a little bit\nWhile the gun lobby control is funded by a blank check from uh New York city anti gun billionaire the n._r._a. relies on millions of small donations from working men and women his money is no match for our grassroots organization and the\n... the lead up to that wasn't NRA spokeswoman said Bloomberg's money would not overturned public support for the second amendment of the U.S constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms Alan I'm I'm not so sure about that statement because when you have people you just said coming up behind me\nYounger generation seen nothing but anti gun crap all day long it begins in the media knows is why they do it is by Bloomberg's knowing it begins to drive that narrative that guns are bad doesn't it\nYeah and I don't really agree with that statement at all that's why we're seeing here like in Washington state on the sixteenth thirty nine and I get an issue on the ballot here\nAre grassroots you know ... you know working with the n._r._a. and set of speakers right keep and bear arms as pretty cold for a while when we pulled up and all of us can even with polling data\nOn his anti get an initiative only to find this week three billionaires one being Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for last minute media by ... to help critical for them to them over the top\nAnd I don't have to expend thousand dollars but in the immediate by I compete with it\nSo all we do have the grass roots and we definitely have more grassroots side does those advertising dollars they're Seventy sixty seconds TV and radio spots\nHave an impact as particularly on the uh\nMore uninformed voter or the casual voter out here and that's ... that's our concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel a whole lot safer but winning I I'm hoping I graduated is can be strong enough to win on that particular ballot measure but if we don't win is approved is putting its dollars and bought the election\nYou what concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't it that statement concerned me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want it to create complacency I think the statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look with the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about that what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our duff we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say you felt better last week and you did this week is that a fair statement\nOh yeah I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week\nI don't feel that I did with that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those and you know one of the problems we have is we want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes can't believe your own rhetoric a and sometimes it's better to let people know who they are in the battle\nYou know I always say that are actually won election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes\nS a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies this is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American rented it tell us about this one real quick\nListen to the sheriff's office decide because California genesis may issue says

actually say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we once it's like this all across the country will win this suit as well and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly get permits out in ... in his county and he's he's in a tough re election battle right now\nLet's go probably ... ... a good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will
