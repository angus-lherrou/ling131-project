smart going to zip recruiter dot com slash Dana to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend\nBut he is very uh he's law and order right he's super serious and I almost think that's a negative for him\nHe's just not shrill and over the top he's not he's he's pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll could bought when he needs to but he's just laid back and he wants to get it done\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done and that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that as an mistakenly I think there's a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's\nJust that he is very serious\nAnd are not making the comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he just says no charisma because he's so serious no one would ever say that\nJust people have different demeanor and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that get real\nTo my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew\nNow there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hot that for activism [noise]\nUh but I think that was before Holly even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said she lied again and she's desperate\nTo spin this says oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump\nOr if the house and Senate somehow change\nHands to Democrat and we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her Stafford they have to get over it and her staffers day well she supports a ban on some item attic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't seen anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows that she said she supports an assault weapons ban\nBut here's the different she kinda got caught\nBecause when you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left to use that as the term I mean all semi automatic rifles but they know that saying all semi automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you so they don't say all semi automatic rifles they say assault weapons\nSo as to to suggest that they actually only support banning just a couple of kinds of semi automatic rifles but that really it\nBut that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I had them easily pulled out the two thousand and two wells are all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime report which was the last collection available and they'll have others coming up I think there's one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there is nothing for twenty Eighteen yet\nSingular twenty Seventeen report that's been published there's nothing for twenty Eighteen yet but the two thousand twelve and twenty sixteen report when you look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are\nA suicide et cetera uh the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe the automobile accidents are hands feet and says those are two and three times\nA deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons\nAnd that's according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Google in for FBI uniformed crime report UCR twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and goggles\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even it's it there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say that they say assault weapons they don't want to say semi semi automatic rifles\nBecause then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handgun and they just got to go out for whatever else is left and that's the goal is incremental and they want to change the language which is why they made up these terms so when she gets out there and she says that you know for an assault weapons ban okay so semi automatic rifles\nAnd when she won't clarify that well\nWhat what do you what are you what conclusion do you come to win a politician\nWill not publically say no that's not true I don't do that and they're just quite from it and they run and hide from it what conclusion do you usually drop Ken what do you usually think about an issue where a politician act like that what it looks like they're being a little disingenuous sounds like they support it doesn't it yeah yeah I'm trying to make you believe otherwise yeah exactly\n\nThat's exactly it and so she knows very well that how silly it was that she's sitting here accusing Josh Hawley it's just silly\nAnd we've asked her on this program numerous times um I've always been incredibly civil but I'm I'm going to disagree with you and I'm going to question you she looks at that as an act of incivility which is why at one press conference I asked her question and she began screaming at me she was yelling at me in front of\nAll of this media she was yelling at me she falsely accused me of working on her opponent's campaign and all of this stuff and I'm like I've never ever worked on a campaign ever I have never worked on a campaign\nEver\nNow all support issues never worked on a campaign not since I was in college and it was for a Bill Clinton and I was just a little lowly volunteer don't hold it against me there was this is his reelection but\nYeah so um that's you know it it was silly for her to say that the the thing is though is the press in Missouri seriously is always been kind of weird but they've got to I think it's it's media malpractice\nFrom Missouri pressing I ask her where an ... because isn't that the whole purpose of\nMedia I mean you are supposed to\nYou're you're you're supposed to get information and share it with people\nRight I mean she was asked about you know this stuff and it looks like she's really really are trying to hide her\nHer full I'm really trying to hide what her positions are from moderate voters\nNow the Missouri debate I think the Senate betas tonight\nSo mhm\nThat's in a bait that Senate debate is ah from what I understand this evening now she's already demanded that there'll be a special prosecutor brought in to investigate the fraud she says okay so what do you mean fraud\nWhen the hell was fraudulent because if you want to I mean we let's first defined what the fraud was what was the fraud\nThe frog seems is I mean when I look at it I see the fraud if you're not being up front with your position senator\nI I see you try to have it both ways\n\nAnd a video showing where are you truly stand how has a video showing the truth fraud I Would love for that to be defined please define that where is that fraud yeah so I you know hopefully that I Would love\nTo see that as a question most so many moderator suck though I don't know who's modernity tonight but I'll find out\nUh the some of them hopefully that won't be as bad as the Texas Senate debate moderators we have more to touch on car shield is a great program that you should check out because it's extended vehicle
