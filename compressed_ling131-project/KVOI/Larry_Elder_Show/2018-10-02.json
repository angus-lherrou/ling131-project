implement it last year and I assume that the repeal of that gas tax increase will be popular the measure uh is called the proposition six\nOr it's on the ballot to repeal this gas tax but it turns out according to a poll that just came out a couple of days ago\nThe majority of likely voters oppose proposition sick they want to keep the the gas tax what's what's what's the deal with that\nOr is it the same polling firm that predicted that we'd have to Democrats than the race for governor not sure about that uh now I think the repeal is wildly popular Larry is because the political class has mismanaged Caltrans\nAnd Gavin Newsom is all in favor of that but I got to tell you that the mothers and fathers of young or Hispanic kids as well as other kids in this state don't want I must Thirteen and California recruiting their children\nAnd uh it's going to be repealed or when I'm the governor but\nRight now and I met the young uh Huntington Beach or a city attorney who mounted this

rid of it\nJohn Cox before or this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost city in a charter city he turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nOr San

the federal immigration authorities they can if they want to\nEr during routine traffic stops inquiry about the immigration status of people\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty ... cities in the state coming about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this uh in\nYou know they're they're in the process of trying to get that the state to approve a a

why\nSo she provided the Washington Post with our therapists note but the committee making a decision on the actual nomination of the Supreme Court justice she refused to give than her notes but wants them to consider the fact that her no she says corroborate her testimony\nBut she they can't see the notes\nBut just trust that the notes corroborate everything that she's telling them but you can't see the notes literally that is what the lay of the land is\nWith the Washington Post as she didn't mention Kavanaugh\nShe was not the only time cabinet ever came up was after the news broke that he was the nominee he was not ever mentioned in her notes\nThat Michel ... outlines there was NO NAME and the twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME given and the twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nAnd it took thirty six years for him to for his name to emerge and\nSo that's I mean I I just I don't know I'm\nMitchell notes quote Dr four testified that she told her husband a buddy quote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post ... her husband that she was a victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\nSo forward um Mitchell says at Ford was changing her description of the incident to become less specific\nUm Mitchell says she noted that there was no memory of who invited her to the party how she heard about it really where it was how she got to it and\nUm she did not know how she got home she did not know if she made a phone call she did not know she talked to anyone else at there after ...\nUm Mitchell also noted quote according to her letter to Dr Feinstein or to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party go downstairs well she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nUm\nShe also noted Mitchell also noted that the number of people at the party was inconsistent and kept changing um originally there were four boys at the party and that was and then there were four boys and a couple of girls\nAnd their ... and that's that's what that that's what the the trouble is and\nMitchell noted that her reasons for coming forward are inconsistent\nAh she said that a mental notes call it the person operating the tip line at the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist for husbands who she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker\nShe testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and to the president she did not contact the Senate however because she claimed she did not know how to do that yes she does not explain how she knew how to contact representative and issue but not her senator\nOr the she can't\nRecall and this was what kept coming up with Michel she apparently took the her polygraph the day of her grandmother's funeral or right after her grandmother's funeral and ah the reason that Michel focus so much on that is because she says quote it would be inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nBecause polygraphs are already so unbelievably unreliable that's why there and admissible in a court of law as any sort of evidence\nUm she also\nThere was all a win win Mitt Mitchell noted that there was some discrepancies in terms of the effect that the trauma had and she doesn't know if it was because you know the lawyers are affecting us or what it was but does she noticed there were there were twelve rather large inconsistencies and all of\nThat and that the post article says that Kavanaugh isn't named\nAnd in the therapists notes but yet for wants to the Senate Judiciary committee the committee to believe that Kavanaugh was named in the notes that she says are her biggest piece of evidence corroborating her story\nYet she won't give them the notes so that's huge she also doesn't know if during the polygraph there was a video or audio recording and they have no idea what questions were asked\nSo this is why progressive or just attacking Rachel Mitchell um relentlessly right now so I you know I it just it's I'm a pretty it's just I'm inconsistent\nSo when I hear people like Lisa Bloom say well there is evidence and there's testimony the testimony is inconsistent and that's according to the the third party that was brought in\nThere isn't any evidence to corroborate any of this information there isn't even to the ... named witnesses don't even corroborate a the named witnesses are actually disputing the of events and the\nAlleged occurrence so all of that and they're doing so on record under penalty of felony\nWhich uh that's that's\nPretty significant that's pretty significant\nSo now they're ... they're Democrats or further moving the goalposts because the whole Kavanaugh's a rapist isn't sticking Kavanaugh's the serial rapist isn't sticking\nHim hosting gang rapes isn't sticking so now they're trying to say oh well he was not consistent or he was um not truthful when he was discussing about his alcohol consumption so now they're moving to alcohol consumption because the rape charges aren't sticking\nSo that's the new thing that's what they're doing this week and they're going to spend all week trying to shore up that new talking point and the relocation of their goal posts we're gonna talk about that coming up as well uh initially a cabinet third accusers holy not credible we'll discuss that\nAnd a Kanye West was I was a ... you
