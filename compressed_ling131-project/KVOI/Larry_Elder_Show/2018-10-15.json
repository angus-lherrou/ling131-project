I think you and I both lived down here during that period of time and that's the closest thing that I can remember in terms of Panama beach and what it looked like Panama City I'm Sorry what it looked like when I thought\nI didn't get to Mexico beach I've seen that I was at the you see down there the emergency operations center the drone that just come back so we have the fresh and it is and it basically as a total wipe out and it and it's hard to imagine it ever really being able to recapture the exact identity at one side it'll be rebuilt it'll all be rebuilt at some point\nBut it's got to take a long time you know in terms of electricity in Panama City uh that whole grade has to be rebuilt not restoration but I Want to tell you what I'm really most concerned about it I'm concerned about all of it\nThere are a lot of inland areas some of these poor rural counties or to the north of there these counties took a devastating hit and we're talking about poor people many of them older\nMiles from each other isolated in many cases from roads and\nMiles from each other isolated in many cases from rose including some dirt roads are cut off right now because we haven't been able to reach those people on a number of days\nAnd I know they're doing the best they can to get to them but I'm really very\n... they're more they're more the federal government is there more resources you want from the feds here is it a is there some military support that's necessary here in order to to speed up the ability to get to some of these communities\nMay be and it's available I what people forget here and I always want to remind them is when it comes to hurricanes state government is in the lead it is the state government who's in charge of the response the federal government's dancing support the state government tells the federal government we need this and we need that so far I have not heard of anything the state government is asked for\nThe federal government has not step forward to provide whether there needs to be more that's something that will see in the days to come but I Know the federal government including the department of defense is standing ready to offer even more if the state says it needs it\nI Know that a political norms get erased all the time now but one of the ... race in Florida which was\nIn the middle of a hurricane coming and hitting the shores there was always this cease fire on television no political negative ads that didn't happen this time you had the Republican Party running negative ads against Andrew Gillum gets them super PACs running negative ads against both Rick Scott and Bill Nelson\nUm is this just part for the course or would you like to see this sort of\nPut back into place of the candidates be more steadfast\nTaking politics out of hurricanes\nYeah look I don't think anything's ever going to be the way it once was appalled especially on the eve of the election were four weeks away and my my fundamental question is whether politics is standing in the way of dealing with the hurricane that would be the one thing I'd have a real problem with and I don't think television ads whether they're right or wrong from a moral perspective I don't think television ads keep\nCandidates from doing their job for example you saw the mayor Tallahassee went back to Tallahassee and the governor's doing his job there and Bill Nelson my colleague was focused on the hurricane as well\nUh Rhonda ... is not an office right now as an elected official but but his uh his running mate Jeanette Munoz is and she was at the ELC and has been doing her job speaker for temporary of the state the number two in the Florida House\nUh to do some of these things and a more aggressive way look what has happened in Yemen and that's awful awful tragic war but I also think that Donald Trump's uh I'm\nSigning up to authoritarian leaders around the globe the ... to deter days and others are Donald Trump's condemnation of the press that's critical of Donald Trump's continue dishonesty and denials of the reality even when All Facts point against it I think that has encouraged and be asked to go along this road did you\nPut NBS in the same columnist put\nI Would put him is clearly in the authoritarian autocratic account absolutely\nAll right John Brennan director of CIA I come I'm sharing your expertise fingers thanks very much appreciate\nIt when we come back those mid term elections and why and they all come down\nTo the man was not even on the ballot ...

here let me check the director of domestic policy studies at Stanford University NBC News national political reporter Kelly and her Mitchell NBC industry quite a ... a ... foreign affairs correspondent maker of individual reports on MSNBC and Peter Baker his the chip off course bought it for the New York times and co author of a new book called impeachment\nAnd American history ah he writes the bill Clinton chapter for those wondering is a nice to see let me start with where we just left off with a former CIA director\nJohn Brennan and of course the Senator Marco Rubio here's this full page ad in the Washington from the Washington Post\nAnd their own full page ads saying on ... on Tuesday October second washing post college democracy OJ enter the capital of Saudi Arabia and assemble he has not been seen since demand answers Andrea Mitchell you heard Marco Rubio you heard John Brennan what did you hear\nI heard that Congress has got to take action when they prove this and they will prove it\nWhether they claim that with an accident and this guy in a kidnapping attempt kidnapping rendition is also violence that's also taking someone and arguably if we had in ... and clear from my reporting when we had intelligence that may and in real time or afterwards or after the fact\nThat there probably should have been warning if we had any any way of stopping it but in any case there will be action from Congress the president had his voice they've already\nIn the Foreign Relations committee gone within ... letter which is way of saying to the president there are now under an affirmative requirement legal requirement to investigate that's which\nThey've been facing to not want to do investigate it with a time limit and sanctions are coming and this is going to be sanctions against they ... the Saudi oil\nMarket I mean this is a big foreign policy quite we are in a war with them and then so how did that I think it's fair so this relationship is not going to be able to stand firm against ...\nNow Peter Baker on each and currently a take where the word Saudi Arabia and insert the word Russia yeah\nTo say like names feels like it's the same thing Congress has United yeah the president is isolated what strikes me is NBS is a lot like the early ... which they say they were\nSo what strikes me is NBS is a lot like the early ... which just said there were moments when people found him to be a a performer a modernized with in the hopes that he was going to be somebody who could be a friend with the west and in fact\nAt home he was cracking down pretty hard we're seeing the same thing I think in Saudi Arabia the difference is when when Russia\nA poisons a former Russian agent on British soil we can unite against Russia because Russia is not an ally is Andrea said Saudi Arabia is an ally it makes much more complicated we're stuck between two friends who were NATO ally turkey and Saudi Arabia who's been friends since the Nineteen forties would put any president and the toughest\nOn the way we treat Saudi Arabia will but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are some regional dynamics are that are very complicated granted we certainly have an important alliance the Saudis but let's not forget who benefits\nIf we somehow having fracturing of our relationship with the Saudis right the Turks are ready to step in the Qataris care as well and don't forget Ron right so this whole region actually is very complicated to the extent that we believe the Saudis did indeed do this\nHuge problem and we obviously have to do something about it but let's not forget there are other players in the region that have interests as well so let's not be so quick to run the judgment unless we have complete thorough evidence of justice actually happened\nWell I Would also say that if you step back and look at um the way that some officials in the government particularly and intelligence community viewed NBS there was deep concern about his the way he operates you very young he's thirty three years old he\nIs ruthless he seen as a little bit reckless he's seen as somebody who\nHas this a lot of rope from this administration in particular and yet as somebody who because of his impulses needs a check from the United states until we hadn't had that and this is the kind of thing that intelligence hit me in the officials had been worried about for quite some time\nPart ownership a little bit the President Bush by the way I think ... and we're realizing envious does care what the elites in this country thinking boy elites turned against him\nSick time after after in voting and community\nWell we'll see how they react and the next couple of days we've heard that the president here because he does seem to be well let me put it ... with Andrew Sullivan no Donald Trump defender\nYeah I'm here for the rights Trump's record as a force of destruction is put them but as the months stick by there's a dissent decent case that Trump's proactive accomplishments are beginning to add up as well your tax cut to Supreme Court justices wholesale deregulation when you go on NAFTA isolation of Iran and abroad or re boot a bilateral nationalism\nOn the world stage ...\nWhile this was always the essence of the Trump argument particularly to Republicans who are a little bit hesitant about whether you like me or not I'm going to get these things done that you care about and particularly in the Senate races around the country we are seeing how that is animating itself I particularly with respect to the Supreme Court fight\nAnd that's the big difference here Claire McCaskill wants to protect Obamacare by with any condition by any means necessary I think we need to clear away the failure of Obamacare and put patients back in charge of their health care\nAlright final question for you we found a clip of a TV ad you ran when you're running for attorney general into doubts and sixty here's what you said in that at\n... bullet career moments in just climbing the ladder using one office to get another I'm ... I think you deserve better than\nYou within two years immediately ran for the U.S Senate what would you say to yourself in that\nI Would say that the future of our country's in steak\nAnd I would say you could see it with the hearings that just as Kevin all you can see it and what we're seeing out on the streets now the future of this country and our way of life years at stake and it's incumbent upon all of us to do all that we can I'm trying to do my part to make sure that we fight for the future of this country and fight for Missouri Claire McCaskill has not but I Will All right\nJosh Holly Republican nominee for the U.S Senate in Missouri appreciate your coming on and sharing your views be safe in the campaign trail with\nThank you so much sex joke you gotta thank you and joining me now from Atlanta is Stacey Abrams welcome to meet the press thank you for having me let me start with the impact of hurricane Michael particularly on southwest\nGeorgia I Know your opponent is going to be two in the area or this week and his capacity as secretary said he says to to see how\nA local officials are going to be able to see if they can handle the start of early voting tomorrow or\nLet me ask you what do you know uh about the area\nHow things are going are they ready to to be worrying about early voting yet or do they need to be worrying about getting the power\nI I think it's going to be a combination ah areas like Albany ore Glasgow county Carolyn parts of south west Georgia were very strongly devastated\nI Know that Georgia Power and the ... are doing the best they can to turn power back on and deliver it to many people as possible\nBut luckily early voting allows for major centers to except those and I hope that the priority will be with in terms of voting making sure that those places are ready but I Know all of our hearts are reaching out to everyone in those areas\nI've gone through hurricane devastating process and it takes months her recovery to happen but I think that the governor and at the state leaders who've done a great job of responding very quickly\nI'm curious what your message to residents of the area or you could be the governor and a cup you can be elected governor in a couple of weeks suddenly the task of rebuilding\nOn this part of Georgia is on a is on your to do list what's your message to those voters why you would be better prepared to leave the recovery than your opponent\nNumber one I've been through this myself I understand that it's not just the physical plants that's a problem it's making sure that people have access to the resources they need\nAnd often when the camera's turned off and when people go home to stop volunteering that's when the real trouble starts when people who had been unemployed are continuing to try to figure out how they can make a living and take care of their families and so I Will leverage the responsibility of the governor\nThe ability to connect with state and local officials and federal officials to make certain that resources don't just end when the memory of the storm passes for the average person\nAnd I think that's what you need someone who's thinking about this not as a three day or three weeks return but really as a ten month twelve months recovery period\nLet me ask you about an issue that's been front and Center for your campaign over the last week to ten days and that is a this issue of rejected voter registration forms due to this issue of exact match if it is an exact match then suddenly the registration gets thrown out Seventy percent of these registrations belonged to African American voters\nYou believe this is an intentional decision by your um by your opponent in the office that he runs\n... absolutely I was part of the coalition that sued him and twenty sixteen to force him to stop using this process and a federal judge agreed with that said that he had unlawfully canceled more than thirty three thousand registrations and they forced interest or does registration\nAnd response the Republicans passed a law in the twenty Seventeen legislative session to allow him to do it again\nAnd so the challenge is two fold one is that we know this is a flawed system that has a disproportionate effect on people of color but it also has the ability to erode trust in our system I know that\nSecretary camp is well aware of this and it's part of the pattern of behavior where he tries to tell the playing field in his favor or in the favor of his party this should not require erosion of public trust\nAre you confident this was going to be a fair election in November\nI Am and here's why the fifty three thousand that we know about do you have the ability to go and cast about the problem is it's a subjective system with a hundred and fifty nine counties and thousands of precincts poll workers being asked to substantially verify\nThat's why this is problematic because we're creating another set of hurdles for people who simply want to exercise their right to that but my organization working with Democratic Party we put together the largest voter protection effort in the state's history and we have national organizations that are also paying attention and I think we can make this work\nI Want to ask you about a comment that Eric Holder made former attorney general he was campaigning for you are\nAnd it's sort of blown up into a bit of a national story a and essentially said when they go low we go high no no no no when they go low we kick 'em he goes on to explain what he meant by that that it was more proverbial than anything else\nBut where do you come down on that show you all know Michelle Obama side when they go low Hugo high and you stick to it or what Eric Holder's preaching no you know every once in a while you got to kick off\nI think there's a hyperbolic moments that happens in every campaign\nBut if you watch my campaign from the beginning\nThrough today I have always focused on three issues education jobs and health care I don't point shot guns at people in my commercials to try to create history our next and I don't use slogan nearing to try to get things done\nMy responsibility to show Georgians how I Will lead the state and if they watched my campaign from the very beginning of June twenty Seventeen through November sex they will be the same consistent leadership that I Will bring to the governor's office\nSounds like you're siding with Michelle Obama won't put words in your mouth but that's what it sounds like to me fair enough\nI Am in siding with the people who just\nFair enough\nI Am and siding with the people who Georgia that I intend to be a strong leader\nStacey Abrams I'm going to leave it there uh be safe for the campaign trail I appreciate your coming on external views I

A. R. M. E. D.\nU. eight seven to two to\n... our ... to eight seven to two to one that cold beer at the stadium never did get it\nBut nonetheless it was cool because I wanted on attacks by taxing something very similar at a Braves game by the way how 'bout that game last night I let yesterday there was a lot going on when I got off the air yesterday yesterday was a fun Sunday I was up rather late\nBecause I had to finish watching the Braves in ethics fashion I had to watch the game that my wife and my daughter were at\nYesterday while I was on the air\nAs they won in while it was quiet it was quite an exciting ballgame nationally division series\nGame three they want it and what was at least scared to death as a Braves fan and a season ticket holder Freddie Freeman's home run popped up made it sixty five and they held on it was a lot of fun to watch then of course after that the walking dead was back on\nSo I had to watch that fell asleep a couple of times watching that got up nonetheless wound up seeing it great to see the walking dead back on\nThere was a lot going on yesterday Dover was being run NASCAR races Dover was being run yesterday during the day football couldn't care less I don't know who played don't give a crap about him don't care\nBut there was that you got baseball this is just a fun time of year if you enjoy watching baseball show and yes the Braves are playing right now\n... how come I'm not there that's a great question freedom never takes a break freedom every picture break or does it could it be\nTechnology you just never know [laughter]\nAll right so let me welcome back let's have some fun with Colin Powell let's pick this guy apart shall we and have some fun doing it again what does this have to do with your guns what does it irrelevant Colin Powell have to do with your it has everything to do with your gun\nHe is making himself we're trying to make him so relevant again by no I Know by appearing on CNN with freed the car you that's relevant well yeah\nIt is for some reason he's out there CNN reached out to him or his publicist is making the rounds in I get a lot of that stuff I haven't seen anything\nAnd I get a lot of that stuff I haven't seen anything from those publicist Colin Powell is available like to talk about so and so I haven't seen anything I'll keep my eyes but I get a lot of that stuff\nBut I Want to go back and talk about some of these things has everything to do with your gun because Powell is like your guns how abandoned the Republican Party and supported Obama if you recall yeah that's what Republicans do you know would support Obama\nNamed me would you what does that make you if you support Obama does that make you a Republican\nHell no it\nDoesn't make you a Republican makes you think butter Republican\nThese are the kind of people Republicans establishments guy that Trump is clearing out and making irrelevant these are bygone era guys and girls that Josh cannot accept that they are bygone era guys and girls now\nAnd they are seeking to reestablish themselves\nAnd imagine if the Republican Party has a guy like Colin Powell at the helm someday a guy who says it's OK to register your stuff and you don't need certain things but he claims that support the right to bear arms he doesn't support us saying\nHe supports his right to bear arms and to protect himself and he supports your right to have a weapon that he\nChooses was okay for you this has everything to do with guns and I want you to view what we're going to talk about and pick apart from him right now through that lens\nHe says that he doesn't know that Trump can be the moral leader for the world because right now that is not the way he's acting\nLet me tell Cohen ... he's not supposed to be the moral leader for the world Trump is acting to fix all of the things that everybody before him that tried to be the moral leader of the world\nScrewed up that's what Trump is fixing today\nAmerica First because Powell and his cronies his un global averse who screwed everything up and shipped millions of jobs over this is what Trump is fixing\nThat's why he's acting the way he's acting to use\n... terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to ... to people that's not true we the people are the American people not we the people of the global world of earth we the people in power means\nUs America and ... says and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and said that the media is the enemy of American because the media the enemy of Americans call and you don't like to hear that\nI've been you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me yeah right bolt bold question huh I've been calling the ... the ... the the waivers threat to Americans for years on armed American radio\nAnd it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are a threat\nHe's metaphorically speaking how not an enemy on a battlefield but a battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking to understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun hating for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately point to that as\nAn example for their propagandize and weaponize ...\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us whether it's Christianity whether it's gun right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this problem is is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out to you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores I've been covered I'm with you for years\nI don't know who you're talking about there but I Would suggest that he hasn't\nThat what he has done is real from America's position of strength by not being beaten down anymore by the very people who pummeled you in previous administrations into the ground for decades\nAnd walked on us and cost us billions\nBy the way what does this have to do with guns everything you know the United nations attempting to beat Americans guns into the ground of which I'm sure wow would sit and have a conversation with those people Donald Trump would tell them to go pounds salt sorry\nHow would look at that as an insult because he didn't sit and talk to them because he's looking out for you\n\nAnd he says he insulted all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debates yeah politics is rough and tumble and every single one of 'em deserve it\nAnd none of them could effectively fight back Donald Trump buried them by the way Mr ... who's the president\nExactly\nAnd he says I don't think that's what should be coming out of the president of the United states\nReally\nSo he doesn't think providing black Americans the lowest unemployment the history of the country or providing women the lowest unemployment among many other things for these groups of people if you want to separate them into groups\nThe lowest unemployment for women in history that's a problem for me doesn't think that's what should be coming out of the president of the United states\n\nHe wants the president of the United states to play nice nice with people coming across our borders\nIllegally harming American citizens bringing drugs galore across the border and crime with them\nThat's OK Colin Powell wants to sit down and talk to those people and play nice he would probably sit down with Dianne Feinstein and play nice with her during the Kavanaugh hearings as well\n\nAnd corn houses but I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years I just told you what's changed Colin Powell doesn't see that he does he's ignoring it intentionally and that would be intellectually dishonest\n\nAlbright additive Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is so not true well of course she would argue that she's the one that put us there one of many who put us there she's one who had a hand in putting us there\nWe have been a victim we've been sucked dry by European nations and our quote unquote friends for years including our enemies China\nComes to mind for decades they have been sucking billions of dollars out of this country that is a victim\nThe world is watching power that they cannot believe we are doing things like separating mothers and children who are trying to get across the border from South of our border\n\nThey are separating criminals you just as they do if someone's caught on a traffic stop they send the child the child welfare services while they put the parents in jail\n\nColin Powell is reciting the lives of the left are you following me here the lives of the left\n\nHe didn't say that when Barack Obama was doing the exact same thing\nColin Powell is not talking to you about the fact that many of these so called parents aren't parents at all\nWhat are faring kids across the country across the border in an attempt to get here illegally than they are the ones in fact exploiting children for their own game\n\nHouses they can't believe we're making such an effort to see the immigration coming into the country we're not it's called the think illegal immigration Mr Powell\nFacts are stubborn things sir\nBut they can't be made off you are not if you are not entitled to your own set of facts back after

that I Believe in God and I'm not ashamed or afraid to say it loud and clear and nor shows you know\nOr should you and all of this ties together mark yes that was why I'm now in keeping your second segment because you are truly living walking breathing an American patriot a hero in and I think everybody's eyes so I don't consider myself a hero or do we argue those guys never came home but we do and we consider all of your heroes\nAnd I I Know how to accept that you know that's what makes you so humble and I hear that from a lot of people that I talked to a lot of veterans combat vets will say the same thing that's what's so awesome how about you guys and girls it's what the what is what makes you guys a cut above the rest in in my eyes in my estimation\nThat very humble ... after what you've gone through is in fact what makes you a hero if that makes any sense from my perspective\nThere's other people that sacrifice for this country at the blue silver and gold star families just write the blue than the blue star families their loved ones are in the war the silver star\nTo start families their loved ones are in the war the silver star families their loved ones are wounded and they're working to try and get them back into the mainstream of life and the gold star families their loved ones have been killed\nAnd last Sunday in September as gold star mothers day the best kept secret in America it absolutely and I tell the kids you know I asked them idiots could you just say thank you to these families on their day\nYou know given more than they give the ground hogs you know and they don't even at\nThis stage though we're at a point now where\nHistory I thought I have a Thirteen year old son he's fourteen officer fourteen September thirtieth my daughter will be

whole freedom up to stand up for God and country and they don't they need to be taught that it's not they don't get everything for nothing\nWhy is why we're sitting here what segue this 'cause this was a short segment unfortunately but why is what we're talking about now\nWhat makes where we are today such a vital part of where we're why are you a member of Arizona citizens defensively and why are you wearing a gun on your hip and fighting for our right to keep and bear arms right now disabled\nBecause the more people that carry the bad guys are more wary\nTrying to do anything they're not going to invade a house in Arizona because everybody carries most people have guns you go to New Jersey most people don't and so the bad guys now they're good they can they going to cost a woman\nBecause the chance of her having a gun or zero\nCompared to the how many how many women carrying Arizona forget about it so just the fact that you carry isn't it isn't it isn't about that you're going to use it the fact that it's there\nAnd he was ... it has the freedom and the right this is a state whose history I Love\nI'll be broadcasting from tombstone Arizona live on the Daily Show Monday and Tuesday following this program tomorrow in the day after\nAnd I love it I get out there once a year this is just the history of the state to state was built on the gun it was built on fundamental individual ism as Americans move West is was this was a rugged place even today right I mean this is\nAmerica here and wild wild west you know any Bloomberg knows that he spending tons of money he's got he's got a big giant sticker right on Arizona and he doesn't understand of course he doesn't but what we understand the idea that\nWe understand that he wants to take that right from us and easy CDLs at the tip of disappearing fighting for that if he thinks that if he could take all the guns away and nobody went to war there wouldn't be in a\nWhile he or she wants to he wants to keep his own guns oh sure he regards of gun isn't it ironic that he stands there and talk to you you're shaking your head laughing and I've never met you before you understand the joke you know Iraq or see here yeah it's a job\nThat's ridiculous if he spent\nThat time and energy and even helping kids instead of screaming that he's going to take our guns away [noise] work on and helping young people\nWere kind of helping young people imagine the good he could do with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that he's spending and trying to take away American writer kid\nA healthy breakfast every morning and that kid got up and could go to school and learn\nThe constitution and the bill of rights and how great America's freedom is and how many people are living in good very good condition he could do far more good\nBut then you know at least he's on a path that he wants to take our guns away of his mind I Can't stand the guy I make no bones about that every year I think I I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable of spending I use the analogy\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was a ... a Republican now he's an independent she this is a guy that has no convictions\nBut don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hotdog eating contest every year while he wants to take away oh you know things that causes obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway while he's introducing folks are going to ... shutdown sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets me and if so what was it for ... ... if there is a guy who go it's a typical rich guy who sings because he made so much money he's so much smarter than everybody else all he did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will was well he up the guns that surround him when he was\nNot ever he won't give up anything this security I bet you is it is out this far greater than most people\nHe's got an army is how they can afford it but he thinks because these that smart Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the the the left we've got about a dollar theater Democrat we've got about a minute Saudi or actually to armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important that they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights carry a weapon\nAnd when you can carry it in an open area carrying an open area so that everybody can see that\nDoes guns around and that the bad guys can see you and it's not about the good guys than you and it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they go to rethink how they're going to be\nI'm prying they're evil and that's the deal the guns in a way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nMarked on maestro it was a real pleasure meeting you\nI was a blight on me and I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways the only reason you were across the table oh yeah when we were going to the segments I had planned on going directly to Mr got leaving opening this program\nBut guess what where I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to have started it where we bring somebody in here who are you know I can say you got a real ... you\nGot skin in this game brother oh boy do I do right yeah I still have much much stress that I'm dealing with in a war doesn't go away you said it's been ... years and you feel you're just left Vietnam I just got home and last month I got home\nI'm On the side of the ... where do you think a lot of pictures and I'm going to go ahead and put some social media ones out what to eat and everything else if you want to follow Alan and myself into still make sure to hook up with me on Twitter at a our mark now I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to go a step further when we get there and I'm gonna see if we can't get the town marshal you got to have the Marshall\nThe tunes don't city Marshall has to be on the show with us we're gonna try to make that work\nI've been through a couple marshals down there I Know a couple of deputies very well so when we get there we're going to check with deputy rattler civil rattlesnake you get a town marshal how about that I bet you pull it off [laughter] I'm certainly going to try so that's going to be a tremendous amount of fought okay so here we find ourselves a CDL\nThis is an important meeting a for well for reasons let's start with the fact that you gave them the grass roots organization of the year why\nWell if you look at the room here you see what they are pulling off and the number of of you know supporters and members they've got\n... attending turning out and working for gun rights in Arizona you can see why they deserved it aren't very many grass roots groups in the country they can ... full of people if they've got sitting behind us or their their grassroots worth their you know uh\nYou know they're the elbow grease they put a put down on pedals with a metal these guys really deserve the award that their their their track record last year was phenomenal and of course they got their work cut out for them this year with the election cycle coming up in ... Arizona\n... maybe the key battleground state okay what controls the Senate\nBut let's talk about that it is it's it's control it's gets battleground it's ground zero in a couple of different areas number one that control the Senate why\nWell obviously this is the Republican held seat right now ah and if they ... it it's a it's intense battle polls showing showing your cat it within the margin of error is the polling data this is one of the two seats the Republicans ... could possibly lose\nA and of course they lose both of them they lose control the Senate and gun rights and we're big trouble in the Senate if that happens and all the nominees for the courts you know go down the tubes are this is ... this is critical so we're really in in the ... probably the key battleground state I'm at the Arizona Nevada the two big ones\nTouching each other on the map and this is where it is part of the country that the Republicans cannot afford to lose if they want to keep control of the Senate\nYou block it there's a lot I could go into here because Arizona when we think of Arizona we think of deep red conservative state we think of gun owning guns loving I'm just goes hand in hand\nWe also know battleground from another angle and that is Michael Bloomberg wants to take this state down this organization that we're sitting out here and all of which I'm proud life member of has been working diligently behind the scenes for the last couple of years\nTo put up a preemptive strike if you will across the bow to stop this ballot initiative and they've been pretty successful here legislatively but if we you know I'm going to ask you to are you telling me that they turned blue\nYet could I mean not to be honest about the Republicans have been at each other's throats in disarray internal struggles battles see McCain flake and other members of the party or I mean they pretty much ... in in a lot of cases and shot themselves in the foot\nAnd they pretty much ... in in a lot of cases and shot themselves in the foot uh it's it's a really tough state right now for I'll look into the demographics are changing as well and when you look at the demographic changes that you look at a Republican in fighting a it's a very easy to get costs the seat up it'd be it'd be a horrible off the gun owners nationwide we would\nBe a terrible loss because you're go you would then start to see Arizona senators voting in favor of gun control or not supporting\nPro pro rights movement a you know in the Senate sure they come up and say for example of a concealed carry reciprocity which is now still on the table to the Senate\nWell it goes it goes beyond that you have the you know you're a Republican Senate candidate here supports gun rights Democrat ... would ban assault rifles ... she I mean there's an a Bloomberg proposal that she wouldn't vote for\nAnd Bloomberg are spending a ton of money in this state yes so this this organization in here which won the award as the grass roots organization of the year how many times now\nI don't know or they may wanna twice or this or they they definitely want it this year right now I think everyone at once in the past year\nI I in fact I Know they have I just don't remember recall when let's put it this way they've got their work cut out for them they've obviously got a very dedicated crew people here this is not my first rodeo here I've spoke here with this organization drunk three separate occasions\nAnd the room gets for and for every year and it's going to have to be in order to win this fight you agree\nOh most definitely a you know uh I'm really proud to have them as as a ... year\nI'll tell you what I couldn't be prouder to be here armed American radios monster cash live from the floor here at the Arizona citizens defense league meeting and beautiful Phoenix, Arizona we will be right back after this don't go away great program lined up for it and I [noise]\nOkay gun lover listen up did you entered when you're a brand new gun from the U.S ... yet if\nNot what are you waiting for your about them is the deadline the gun today give away and soon you could get up to twenty four chance to win your gun daily but only if you act very fast twenty four cameras ... even twenty four A.
