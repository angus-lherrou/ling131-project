making use of a weapon of mass destruction which is ... ... interestingly enough exactly what the the Abrams calls just basic air fifteens [noise]\nSo [noise] now we have all of that and so much more

pleased about it kind of West took to Twitter and this was after it was announced and I think everybody just sort of thought that you know he knew what was happening but he said I'm he tweeted a he said uh\nI support or creating jobs\nAnd opportunities for people who need the ... the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our world safer\nI support those or risk their lives to serve and protect us support holding people misuse their power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents are fighting protect her children violence war\nAnd then he also said I introduce Candace talking about ... to the person and it just came to the person who made a logo and they didn't want their name on it so she used to mine I never wanted any association with blacks it I have nothing to do with it\nMy eyes are now open and my now my eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in I Am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative three exclamation points\nYeah well now\nIt could be I I just I just don't think that somebody that went as hard as he did when he was meeting with the president\nAnd everything else I just I just don't see I don't think that he had a change of heart I think that he actually politically he built I think you know I don't know I think he believes in some of the stuff\nI think he believes in certain things um I but I also think that he is not a conservative at all I think that there are just some things that there are some common ground you know like prison reform for instance or some common ground\nStuff there [noise]\nI also think that he's under immense pressure from Hollywood there are people who are supposedly his friends attacking him because he was just speaking out differently about different political issues which I'm Sorry but if you treat me like that you ain't no friend of mine\nIt is amazing you'll find who your friends are once you start speaking about stuff you find who your friends are then you find who the cleaner ons are the people who are just not but social climbers and they want the association you find the cleaners that Klinger honors the people who just want to hang out for the ride and they want you know they want some of that that that you find those people right quick\nThe week people fall you see um I don't know maybe I can from people I Know you find those people super fast and you also find that people that you know really appreciate you for being here right because simply\nVoice an opinion about politics I I'm an ... says Thomas Jefferson quote but I've never thought a difference in political believe would stand in a way of me being a friend with someone unless of course you're talking about completely disarming the and making the victim in which case step off\nA but other than that I think you can find common ground with people ... by by finding common ground for those who have one brain cell up I don't mean that you compromise what you believe and I'm just saying you find something that you do agree on with someone and maybe start some sort of amicable relationship there\nNot hard it's like people forgot how to get all\nWell relationship but there is not hard it's like people forgot how to get along\nBut I think he got so much pressure yeah people who claim that they knew him people were friends with people you know et cetera that were trashing him in the press mainly to get their name and the press more than anything else\nThere was a huge amount of pressure because I think people realize if you even have one person who is prevalent and pop culture that decides to speak out on these issues then that created that creates a a in a set people start\nOther people will start believing this they'll start going on they'll start thinking the same thing or they'll start asking questions being the underdog has always been trendy the biggest lie right now that's being perpetuated is that the mainstream demand the status quo\nThose people are trying to convince you that they're the underdog they're not they've mainstream everything hippies or mainstream that they're not\nCounter culture they are the culture it's counter culture to want limited government it's counter culture to believe that you are empowered enough to take care of your own crap right that is what's counterculture it's counter culture to believe that you don't have to sit here and go tug on the paint like an Uncle Sam every single day in time you got a problem that you need salt that is counter culture\nAnd so they really want to keep that appearance because that sells people like bucking the system there's just something attractive about it\nThere's something attractive about going there is something taboo and taboo also psychological I mean it's its own branding\nBut he's got so much pressure so now he's stepping back I also think that he's seven back for a couple of other reasons so he's got some\nNew sneakers coming out there it is the easy that he has out right now they're not moving product so we're coming up on what season which is coming up\nOn [noise] follow a la la la man\nI almost said Yoho but that was a pirate or you get what I'm saying right\nSo you got to follow the money he's got some sneakers coming up thirtieth us he was supposed to have an album or that it it it was it was postpone a ... that was supposed to come out his album that he came up before that didn't move as many copies as the previous albums\nAnd so\nNow I'm ... I mean it is he's got to really think about this\nAnd they and they say that too that some people might what was it\nFootwear news there's actually an art there's actually literally a thing called footwear news people\nDid you know that I mean I'm not opposed to it I mean I like shoes I'm a I'm a check\nBut America which I don't give you twenty four seven news cycle good at all but no it's pretty much it uh but they say that um it it's a trade\nThere was an article that was done by spotted dot com and foot where news that read quote communist behavior also had a large impact on consumers perception of him to stop that you're going to the fact is that right here because it's such a crock of redacted and this is why\nIt wasn't his behavior it was what everybody was saying about his behavior\nIt wasn't what he was doing it wasn't necessarily how he ... it was how everyone was freaking out about what he was saying that is what had the impact that's how we're the articles wrong that is what had the impact on consumers perception of him\nAnyway they continue they spotted status showing customers are consumers the economy as quote wacky ranking higher than Ninety seven percent of other celebrity celebrities to this attribute\nReally but they think that what he was doing was risky and that he was he might be losing his edging is I think that\nPeople were trying to say that he was losing his ... ridiculed breaks edging us when he ridicule something you steal it that genus away\nPeople don't like being made fun of but you know how you suffer\nTo kill a one finger salute I mean I shouldn't say that as a person who's trying to get right with the lord I really shouldn't but I mean\n... just saying\nPeople try to ridicule you you could ridiculed and back or you could just robbed them of the return on their investment\nI had this this this is kind of how you could look at it\nSo I think that I think he's doing this because he felt pressure he's stepping back because he felt pressure\nThat's what I think he's doing this because he ah I said middle finger but there you have to middle fingers so you're correct King I didn't say you just use your imagination\nBut you know I I just I'm\nI'm just saying it there is so much they're ... it's a cultural thing is with\nUs is heaven forbid somebody speak freely about some heaven forbid somebody have you know a different opinion heaven forbid\nAnd I don't think you should have to quit politics just be trains parent inconsistent I think that's all anybody ever cares about the cool be transparent be consistent that's pretty much it right is that you much like I don't even know\nSo anyway we we have more than to touch on the latest with the caravan also that chick out in Georgia Stacey Abrams she wants to take guns she does she wants to confiscate firearms I was actually talking about this on social media little bit earlier and she bastard ISIS Scully is a opinion where it concerns Heller and I'm going to ... that\nAnd um we'll have some mid term stuff for you as well that we're going to touch on because it is important that you know where things are at I don't want you to be here and things like oh well looks like they're you know we might well it looks like this race is going to be OK none of the races are okay I keep seeing people say silly stuff like this I just\nStop none of them are okay so don't be apathetic get out and vote\nPurple Heart foundation all these people that are held by this organization fought to preserve your right to vote so don't waste it\nThis uh veterans' day is actually coming up what is it and I guess it's eleven on November eleventh is Veterans Day\nAnd it's a should be more than just another date on the calendar I think that we should just associate sacrifice in store for us every day on the calendar year but particularly veterans days when they get universal national recognition and think about it I Want you to think about what a donation to the Purple Heart foundation could do to improve the lives of these that than their families now\nThere are a lot of organizations out there and a lot of um taco good game and they got swing the officers and they have those D.C cocktail parties and\nThey hire fancy lawyers to go after anybody that even uses anything remotely close to the organizational name 'cause that's I guess they want to spend their donations\nThat's not what Purple Heart foundation does they're ... they're not all swing cars are actually out there in the street doing stuff", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "01"}
