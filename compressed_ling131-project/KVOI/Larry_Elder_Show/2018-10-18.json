New Jersey Joseph you're on the Larry on the show thank you so much for calling I appreciate it\nYeah how are you Larry I'm doing well\nI Would have a nice thirty minutes but it's worth it you know let's say okay um I\nI Want to play with a Jewish point I'm Jewish myself the point is to be clear the half of the century between reform conservative Jews\nThat are not proud of being Jewish and trying to either that any between Orthodox Jews that all love Donna Shaw is a big difference when you said Jews\nYou don't really mean Jews you mean just don't want to be Jewish but the real Jews the orthodox once all full support on shop all their average support him and they're even synagogue is just no there's some synagogues on the weekends they have a special blessing for President Trump should just note that's how much the Orthodox Jews\nJews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reform Jews that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jews that love Israel and of course the old on some\nAny personal commonsense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is all eight or enjoy it and say you're going to be a fool not to believe that and went down some there is no president ever ever did in Israel which is why this already two bridges and is on the enough about Trump even a train station but you know that\nI I Do know that but but just to the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again in twenty twenty\nThat's because the Jews tend to say what do you think Jews don't you don't really want to be with us from trying to tell you they're going to vote for people that would not want to support Israel that's what I'm trying to say starts surprise on why they're like that actually makes sense to fit everything right\nJust as my here's my question is if they do does not support Donald Trump do you believe that person or that Jewish person is a shame to being Jewish that's my question to you\nYes with no doubt yes with no ... no that really\nYes I mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish as solid Jewish I mean you've got to be I'm not to vote\nNo I I look look you're preaching to the choir about about the Jewish vote the black vote the Hispanic vote they all these people that overwhelming vote for the Democratic party I think the wrong to do so but I think it's another leap to say are you are so self loathing Jew if you if you don't support the Republican Party and that seemed to be to be what what you're saying Joe so that's what I'm asking you\nYes yes ... dollar summer that's common sense right now you brought up to the world with common sense between two and false\nAll right so so all the Jews who voted for Obama for example in your opinion are self loathing Jew I'm asking\nOh disgusting that you're raising them all the time no question\nSell clothing of course there seemed to be no question that yes there is no doubt about it\nOn down now you're aware Joseph that that's the same slam it's used against black people like me I'm I'm call self loathing because I'm a Republican\n[laughter]\nOkay for the two people who will work out right now after what's going on either you're dumb which is unfortunately the truth that we all know that oh you're a person just evil I mean the people to know what's going on is full support Hillary and all these people are just pure evil which is why I think Trump is so important that these days in office because he represents the truth it's\nBeing Jewish Christian Muslim if you fight for the truth you have to go for something otherwise\nI don't know what okay so Joseph how you feel about people that call people like Kanye West Larry Elder Candace Owens self loathing black people\nOkay so the black people that make fun of black people\nAre two ways also there's there's many many most of them you know I I have a lot of black friends just on the

concealed carry style of handguns and created cutting edge ... rifles and shotguns\n... mission is to create innovative quality firearms to help that your your World Health is an anomaly and the fire on industry because they don't manufacture guns based on market research or profit\nAnd they the tools map competitiveness through a bunch of indicators\nThey look at infrastructure they look at institutions the adoption of information communications technology macroeconomic stability health skills product labor or product market labor market financial system market\nSize business a innovation et cetera et cetera et cetera all good things\nRight that's all great and\nIt's we are the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means it is the now the most competitive country in the world\nNumber one or the ... the world Economic Forum did add a little ...\nThey said well we could still do better on social issues and you can Kiss My edible snakes because I think everything's just just the way it is people are afraid to do what they want and if you don't like it mind your own business\nI just don't understand why freedom is so hard to get for people like the government\nDoes not have to socially beyond your lives and you don't have to be people don't understand freedom of people\nI think there are people out there who are willing Surf's here they they don't understand freedom they think that freedom means that the government guarantees your right to happiness not your pursuit of happiness government doesn't even guarantee that you can pursue something that you all you want to but there's no guarantee that you're going to be happy\nYou just have the freedom to pursue it\nPeople think freedom means comfortable and this and they think freedom means everything is perfect and nothing's wrong in my life and I think that some ... some of these people I just don't think that they have an idea of what reality or freedom\nIs freedom is you do what you want to do someone else is going to do what they want to do but died the idea that a freedom that some of these individuals have is if\nSomeone else is doing something that I don't like the neck not freedom because they're not doing what I Want because they don't believe how I think they should believe because they don't talk how I Want them to talk they don't use the pronouns that I Want them to use they don't recognize the things that I recognize\nThat not freedom that's that's that oppression that tear any fascism and I just so I really don't give a flying rats behind\nWhat the world economic wondering about our social issues is good on two fronts this is good not only because as a competitor in the world the United states is number one number two for all those global as they want this global economy and want to be this this all the support this was the world Economic Forum why don't\nI just think that they I really don't care who they are but they just they just measure the data that's out\nAnd they're the only organization on that level but does it so my point is that even if he was so nice I'm like screw them even if you're a global is this is something good to look at so you really have to hate Trump's\nThis is something good to look good so you really have to Trump if you've been something negative of this thing\nOh yeah I mean I don't I don't get why people would would do that but\nThat's that's the thing that they say they talked\nTo they warned about a ... a brewing trade war between the United states and China they say they're still room for improvement we're number one if you went first year last\nShaking bake so that goes on the best movies ever\nWe wanted to see if we named market Dr Quinn and medicine woman\nThat double Mountain Dew I can quote\nLiterally like watch that movie and say the law everybody's lines more entertaining than the news cycle ...\nAnyway so the uh\nAside from the little cab yet that they had or wherever and they think well we need to you know aside from your social issues ... first off we are doing great economically I think we're pretty good on social issues as well\nTheir idea of how being free with social issues is government regulation of people's behavior beyond don't murder people\nThat's that's that's what they believe it's freedom which is completely the opposite\nSometimes I feel like the world is just one giant black mirror episode you know what I mean\n[noise]\nYou know I don't know ah anyway\nI'm waiting to see if what I said on social media triggered anybody I'm sure it yes there's the triggering this the trigger and has commenced\nI really I'm just I'm really read form an issue today I'm going to talk about this more coming up but I I watched the um\nThe Texas Senate debate last night and I just had a ... a couple of observing says and I've noticed being that you know we live in Dallas I notice that whenever you say anything on line about a Robert or Rourke beta O'Rourke\nThe Irishman who is Elizabeth Warren soft that his people lose their ever loving mind oh my gosh these people are on hinged then all of them 'cause I got a neighbor that has a beta sign and I have a cruising\nHe put a ... I put a crew sign up to put a beta sign up I put seven crew signs out\nJust how I Do and I don't I'm not and I don't I don't do that kind of stuff I don't put like the signs of my you know all of that because I'm actually told not to because people are nuts and they hate me and they threaten to kill me so I got to be careful about stuff because people are more on and I give them a one finger salute\nCome and take it I heavily armed\nBut I shouldn't be I'm just I'm really don't care today but I've noticed and was accepted and I never\nCause I'm pretty sure you know my neighbors pretty cool they're you know for the most part um but I've noticed that\nLike a lot of cruise signs of getting stolen around Dallas yeah and they get destroyed people put pictures up of them doing it um and I also\nKnow there were a bunch of businesses that have been complaining around the area in which I live because people were putting beta signs up on commercial property without getting permission\nFrom the business owners and it was a big thing like I'm On a Facebook page and you know and all the business owners were complaining about it and they said you know it was they actually had to have a couple of words with the ... campaign because they wouldn't stop doing it like one of them put a huge sign on this guy's commercial property like in front of his business\nAnd he's like no you can't do this stuff I'm not going to say this but um yeah I mean that's just you know but I watched the debate last night and I I Know we're going to get going but I got to share this and we're going to come back to more of this\nThere was at one point first off he used his right hand so much to talk and I'm a hands talker but I think that you need to use both of your hands equally because I've watched you and then it affects me because it's a symmetrical\nAnd that bothers me when you only use one half of your body to a moat I Can't stand that I watched it and I felt and even\nYou know anyway that's number one number two he was asked about how he was going to improve border security he didn't say damn thing about border security what he did say was that he thinks that we should spend more money on infrastructure like bridges to Mexico\nI'm not even ... I'm not kidding you dude why did you look at me like yes he said that his idea of border security is building a stronger bridge to Mexico\nAnd you know believe me go and look at the whole debate I'm not even kidding we're gonna come back talk about this more so it was the other thing\nThe third thing is I don't know what the hell he stands for and I watched genuinely now most of the time I Am a horrible smart alec and I am just about as sarcastic as anybody\nMore than anybody but for once I I mean being honest with you I genuinely wanted to see how far left he was and I wanted to see where it came out on certain issues I have no clue where this dude stance\nHe he didn't say anything\nI'm not kidding you guys he's a Bernie Sanders has been able to articulate more clearly what he believes in beta did last night and I watch this thinking who want to help prop this guy for his debate\nWho did this he liked the generic version of Wendy Davis who did this anyway we have a lot more to talk about and\nHow people are mad over Heather Nauert a Instagram page because people get mad over everything in the meantime I should probably chug more more super beach you know really I should I really think I should because I think I Need to be more of a smarter than I Am I'm really busy I'm that's why I don't read half of my emails or look at\nMost of my messages not because I don't want to talk to anybody but because I have things to do you know what I mean like I got laundry I got kids\nI don't have a staff I don't have like you know an assistant it's me\nAnd I work many many hours during the day or even if I'm not on TV I'm Still working and this is one of the busiest times of the year because we also host everybody for all the holidays which I enjoy but it's a lot to do you know what I mean and so I basically I'm just going to be rarely do\nI Need to be hyper powered\nAnd\nLegally [laughter] to repeat this way to do that\nMaybe that's not the best way to put it but I'd be straight with you because it's what you want to hear\nYou don't like drugs you don't want to drink a bunch of sugary energy drinks you need to check out to sea for beach it's natural and it's legal and you know what here's the thing it's good for you\nIt it's based on Nobel Prize winning research from Nineteen Ninety eight I can sit here and get into that but I don't care because you're just one of the people that when you flip the light switch delight comes on and it's only you care about that to me\nSo all I Know is it the night tracing the beach kick start nitric oxide production in your body it makes your arteries wider and more flexible increases your circulation helps maintain healthy blood pressure\nAnd you get I take it as a pre work out for crying out loud so there you go do you need anything else because that's it and there's no awful dirt horrible awfulness taste because beach taste like something you would expect Satan to design", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "18"}
