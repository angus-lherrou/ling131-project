national is\nSo two things and I'm going to come back to that I think there's a difference between nationalism and patriotism and I think that by respecting the law of the republic that makes one a bit of a nationalist\nThere's nothing wrong with with a moderate form of nationalism there never has been\nUm and like I said there's a difference between patriotism and nationalism there and also when you are in a populist era nationalism which seems to increase in terms of identification and in in in terms of appeal\nAnd this\nYou can yes and you can have ... you can be both patriotic and you can have enjoy a modern form of nationalism\nI mean there's I don't think that there's anything wrong with that but here's where here's where this gets it gets weird ah\nThere was a good piece of a friend of mine wrote that uh was discussing this at at National Review discussing how certain strains of conservatism might\nBe discussing how certain strains of conservatism might not fully identify with nationalism or libertarianism because libertarians they see as they write some the borders of barriers to free markets\nAre religious conservatism often emphasizes the God given dignity of all people which transcends national borders\nUh and then they say there are many conservatives are their American conservatives have different kinds which I have been influenced by you know there's a manifestation of patriotism there's you know some some uh support moderate forms of nationalism\nWhere it's not as sinister thing it's not a malicious thing it's there's you you have you can have\nGood nationalism and ... and and bad nationalism depending on how you how you practice and what you believe but here's the thing I Want to come back to it because all these people say oh well Hitler said he's a nationalist okay now do socialist\nDo social is now\nBecause the Nazis were national socialist us the name so now do socialist for all you Democrat socialist out there who are so mad because you say well Trump said he's nationalist and then hit list that he's nationals okay do do socialist now\nAnd see how that works for you go ahead well so they were socialist go ahead I'm Sorry say Hitler Senate right isn't that what you believe isn't that the the party to what you pledged that those the policies you support\nBecause you're naive Leon stupidly believe that the one reason they just haven't worked in the past is because the right people\nDidn't implement them and I'm sure those people at the time thought the reason that their form of government hasn't worked in the path of because of the right people weren't there to implement them and the people before then thought that the one reason that their policies didn't work with because of the right people weren't there to implement them\nThat is the definition of insanity trying the same stupid thing over and over and over and over and over and over again and expecting it to be in any way successful when it is by design a failure\n\nSo there is a noxious form of everything\nI mean you can you can go I mean there's the example of democratic nationalism of which arguments of Lincoln and Churchill and Thatcher they were champions of national sovereignty they were champions of solidarity\nThere's nothing wrong with the loyalty to one's country and and gratitude for the freedoms they're in and and allegiance to to the people and culture and laws that's what it is\n\nThis from an R. O. one nationals and finds political expression it supports a federal government that is jealous of its sovereignty forthright an unapologetic about advancing it's people's interest in mindful\nOf the need for national cohesion\nAnd worthwhile nationalism has these components but beyond the content of countries nationalism depends on its particular character American nationalism has an ideological component so much of one as to render it exceptional that's the phrase American exceptionalism\nThis is a truth underlined these simplification that America\nIs an idea rather than a nation in reality it as a nation with an idea but\nJohn Quincy Adams famous remark and the federalist papers present America as an example to the world when he remarked how America quote goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy was immediately followed by she is the well was sure to the freedom and independence of all\nAnd that is built into our cohesive American DNA\nAnd see this it's not this is an as in our own notes it's it's it's just it's seen easily\nEnough and patriotic fanfare whether it's Memorial Day or fly over George ... July Fourth fireworks et cetera two of the unknown soldier\nThese\nThis\nExplains the revulsion that most people feel when protesters burning American fly because it's based on the belief not that the protesters are symbolically destroying an idea but I think that's how I look at it but some say that they are disrespecting the nation to which they will respect and filthy\nSo there's so many things with with patriotism and there's so many things with nationalism for the president to say what he said\nIt isn't he's not I thought it it asked the night and it it demonstrates and ignorance that has infected the left for people who bragged so much of an intellectualism rarely have I seen such a display\nOf its absence especially in reaction to this particular issue\nAnd the idea that somehow I mean it's all about eve service sooner and to to say that\nThis is a noxious form is pretty supposing at Trump's version of nationalism doesn't include all races are all religions or which is portraying the goal of national unity\nWhich I Would I disagree with that but people who are part is that where they're going to try to find some something to justify their beliefs because it's easier to do\nThat than it is\nJust simply say well maybe perhaps I can consider this alternative or maybe perhaps it isn't that where maybe perhaps this economic policy is worthwhile\n\nAnyway we have a more to uh get into we have a Florida Man coming up next our today and stupidity all of that good stuff so uh make sure that you stick around with us in the meantime\nFor this time of year between work and the kids in school and everything else it's a very very busy time of year\nSo I rely on super beach to help keep my energy level up naturally if you feel like you're dragging more than normal\nMaybe it's a combination of the busy time of year but you can get a little extra energy and you don't need to reach for coffee or\nSugary energy drinks try super beach they've harnessed the power of nutrient and rich beach and created a super food that helps your body make more nitric oxide on its own\nOne teaspoon of super beats daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving you natural energy\nWithout the need of a quick caffeine kick or a sugar high it's real healthy natural energy call eight hundred six six four fifty six Seventeen or visit Dana's beats dot com and find out how to get a free thirty day supply of super beach and free shipping with your first purchase eight hundred six six four fifty six Seventeen Dana's beats\nDot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "24"}
