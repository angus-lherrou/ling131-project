Republicans\nDon't have to work to recast Democrat protests as anything I've you know I think burning buildings and punching people in the face and doing all of that stuff um they do a good enough job of that they're by themselves\n\nThey do they do a good enough job of that all by themselves\n\nAnd they work and like for instance with the cabinet situation I have seen and this is the left is
