you want to go\nBut uh that's not the right answer so here's a place that leads forth as the word education means it goes beans to lead forth that he'll still be understand true education means pursuing the highest answer to the question which way is fourth\nCorrect it is all true may so corny but it is true\nHillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way forth by\nThe way there are people as a result of these hills they'll things now send their kids to hills though it's a it's a if it's not even I don't even think it's part of their thinking when they have us speak about

disturbing the enemy at this time it's not Saudi Arabia is a profoundly flawed ally\n\nWhen you're fighting evil you don't only have allies who sit down and read the federalist papers daily\nRight that's the way it works\nThat's part of the reason that I find it so disgusting that adults believe people were basically good it's a five year old believes that it's excusable the for the dope believes that he's a fool\n\nThe same people who believe people were basically good get all all frazzled when they raised though when when something bad happens oh gee where did that come from\nLet's let's cut off arms sales that way we can strengthen Iran which never kills people like his jokey [laughter] ... bought I get a good chance to feel good about myself I Am cutting off sales to Saudi
