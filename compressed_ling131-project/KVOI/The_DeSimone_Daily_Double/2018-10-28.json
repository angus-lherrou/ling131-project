Sam go on and two Jewish [noise]\nFriends I promise to tell you this week about bringing our new congregation Bates scene because tore up back from London but I'm afraid I'm going to have to postpone that one more week on two Jewish\nAs amazing as the experience was suffice to say that not only is it a really beautiful scroll but the process of getting it homeless extraordinary and meaningful all share it all with you but Nixon day\nTo day I Need to stand on a proverbial soap box for a few moments\nWe had been told very loudly and repeatedly that Israel's nation state law passed over the summer by the Israeli Knesset is racist legislation that creates a system of apartheid for Israeli Arabs and destroys any hope for peace in the middle east\nMany Jews in America and Europe have sharply attack the Israeli government for the nation state law harsh criticism has been leveled at the prime minister claiming that this law is the worst thing any nation has ever done to its own minority populations\nHow could a democracy pass such a racist law we're asked\nBut if you read the actual statute passed by Israel and the nation state law will wonder just what the heck people are talking about\nIt includes such radical statement says the name of the state is Israel and hot chick ... is the national anthem and the state flag is white with two blue stripes and a blue star of David in the center\nThe state's languages Hebrew it says but make special provisions in protections for Arabic speakers\nThis nation state law firms that the land of Israel is the historic homeland the Jewish people and the national home with the Jewish people and that the right to exercise national self determination and the state of Israel is unique to the Jewish people\nThese were the ideals behind the settlement and foundation of Israel from its very beginning all the way back in Nineteen forty eight and they had been central to look for more than Seventy years there is nothing new about anything and the nation state law\nThe full text is available online for anybody who wishes to actually read it instead of just criticizing it\nYou should read it because there isn't a country in the world would be criticized for passing a similar set of such basic foundation of laws confirming what it already is\nIt would be like America passing a law that said the United states of America is our national name man the star Spangled Banner is our\nForgive us national anthem and the stars and stripes is our flag and so on look no other country would get this criticism only Israel gets heat for passing this kind of law\nWe know the Israel isn't perfect because no nation or state is that before jumping to the ridiculous negative conclusions that Israel is bigoted and races that the critics\nIt was known nation or state is before jumping to the ridiculous negative conclusions that Israel is bigoted and races that the critics of Israel urge you to his suit please understand the facts in this situation read the actual text of the nation state law\nSuit to hear from you whenever I go to a place where I've lived before I spend a lot of time\nI don't notice the things people that are going for the first time notice which is you know the beach in Tel Aviv the duty as a sunrise the goal line Adele Neal the hotel I noticed the things that are different what do you see that feels different going back to Israel is time\nSo there are a couple of things are the first thing that I can say that uh you know jump a is a highly\nUh in in a show with you that uh you know my ... United States uh my my first years when people ask me so how long it takes you from like a lot of the way through the south and so you would say nine out of the ADA right as it now\nFive hours and something and the difference is\nHighly you know you have a major highways that were developed a good ... short in time travel north to south a toll roads\nWere have you know ... restaurant faces you can stop great name and relax and risk before you go on so I Would definitely something that uh that made a big difference uh in in Israel go through those ... those who come\nAnd then the second thing I Would say it's a funny thing is a it's a customer service you know I I remember being a younger and\nVisiting Israel or living in Israel the Israeli culture of people say the route some people say that word direct um but a customer so it was a challenge and are these days\nI think because many Israelis travel then they should be to the United states\nAnd uh and and and and ah improve your customer service today a customer cold and listened to and the problem is solved and and you and speedy way so that that the the things that that I can uh\nYeah I mean customer service used to be an oxymoron in Israel like it didn't yeah I'm In [laughter] but yeah I like the old joke about you know Lincoln no Mm Mm pleaded tendency we see you know what do you want for dinner and you see what am I truly she's in their history was yes or no\nYou know [laughter] it's not like that anymore it's a much more civilized enough\nAnd I we actually ... we've flown on that a lot but we feel very loudly and uh and and we were very impressed I mean really I mean I Would give from Europe ten\nAt night just to leave one to grow but it was very very really an excellent felt at home and die in a respected and are served and it was really a great experience\nFantastic Mrs all all great stuff and we will talk next week can hear more about the trip\nLooking forward to it makes much him in to see how\nWe welcome our expert on the international Jewish seen Tom Price morning or good morning rabbi and as usual you've just returned from a trip\nRight rather than long trip um this trip ended with sort of our in our in Israel just visiting friends in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem but it began with a very interesting group about one quarter Tucson and I'm\nIn about three quarters of Jewish\nWho met together in Berlin most people in the trip spent young the poor in Berlin and broke the fast together and then the next day\nToured around Berlin and I think like\nFriday night after young people who are we had a welcome dinner and introductory session and briefing on our whole trip and then we flew off the next morning Theresa the capital of laughing here um\nWe visited um Rica ville news and live in that order\nOn our way to Vienna which was the final stop and know Vienna in Berlin both are ... more western than the other places yes indeed and it was extremely interesting as we went south\nAmong these three big cities which on their own ways were major centers of Jewish history\nUm the standard of living go lower and lower people were poor the cars were visibly last luxurious buildings needed a paint job prices were much lower ... that was quite interesting and quite dramatic because they're not far away from each other um\nAnd each of these places in a way is suey generous um you know the three Baltic countries speak languages that form their own family\nWell actually even that's not true 'cause Estonia speaks as Sony and which is a dialect to finish its like right you know southern finish um Latvia and Lithuania both be Baltic language is but they're not mutually comprehensible and their unrelated to any other language\nI'm younger people if they speak Russian at all they speak it with resentment\nOlder people grew up in Russian so they're still comfortable speaking Russian it allows you to build bridges especially\nIf somebody's really like let's say over sixty five there's almost no chance are gonna know English but it's almost certain that they're gonna know Russian so you can have a conversation um\nAnyway what to read a um we saw the occupation museum which\nTells the history of three different occupations of Latvia the occupation by\nThe\nRussians the occupation by the Soviets and the occupation by the Nazis\nAnd these were all terrible period in Latvia and history where Latvian culture language religion blah blah blah we're\nAlmost extinguished and the museum devotes about a third of its space and resources to what happened to the Jews during the Nazi period so\nI mean in a way you don't have to look for anything else that specifically Jewish because this museum to such a good job or the other thing that your listeners might find interesting is that\nReally has more art nouveau buildings in any other city in the world as hundreds and has a museum of art nouveau and the whole district of art nouveau houses and\nThe vast majority of these buildings were designed by two architects both of whom were Jewish around the turn of the last century so they're like this living monument to Jewish creativity and um the flourishing Jewish community that had once been there is no longer\nThank you Tom well that that that covers a lot of the uh we'll we'll travel the rest of the route with your next week thanks so much looking forward to it\nIt's time now for our old Jewish\nJoke of the week Jewish ... who brought you buy two Jewish fuzzy public service [noise]\nDenny's dog died she goes to see the robot rabbi rabbi wonder whether you could find time to say a special blessing and my dog's grave\nRabbi replies I'm Sorry I'm afraid it's not possible Benny in Jewish law on how well are the rules don't make any allowance for animals then he says but I'm really upset rabbi\nWell maybe you should go see the reform rabbi across the street says about rabbi any starts to walk away dejected Lee and then he turns back the rabbi and says such a shame that he's willing to donate twenty thousand dollars for such a funeral\nAt which point the ... odd rabbi shouts come back come back then he turns around and says I thought you couldn't help me says the rabbi you didn't tell me your dog was orthodox [noise]\nThat was the old Jewish joke week special picture to Jewish goes for you you shouldn't\nBe well we welcome\nOur ... Rhonda Cook then wrote them Rapaport representing the younger perspective on Israel I represented in Israel for the rights of Israel's that her book at a\nLot and ah and I should say almost happy Halloween battling and that's not a holiday you guys are familiar with from before\nYes um we don't have ...

rabbi ... slum of this has been a long time shop one\nIn the navy he has the paint the rank of captain a which is I guess kind of like colonel in the in the army for those of you get\nA full colonel bird colonel they call it full bird colonel I'm he's\nWritten a book the fighting rabbis Jewish military chaplains in American history one of the best books about the Jewish chaplain see he's also written a book America's other clan the United States Supreme court which we started with earlier in the show\nA and is a professor at teacher author and soon to be another podcaster so welcome back effective or much how they tell me a little bit about why you decided to go into the military are and what it's like to be a Jewish chaplain\nWhat's very interesting I uh I guess I had a number of motivations one was I I wanted to serve my country or another motivation which I guess\nOnly a Jewish person would understand which is sort of fat and away with that I was always concerned that people would say to me um are you a loyal American how have you again sort of the country and that\nThat they would ask me that and I'd be able to respond positively another motivation was I wanted to do something different a many rabbis and know that they can go into congregations and hopefully congregations will always be there for them\nA but in this case I met a rabbi who was in the reserves very green all of us alone and um\nHe talked me into it and as I say to people three years became Twenty years and it was a wonderful career and I was truly blessed\nSo he I I Want to talk about some of the chaplain heroes um many of us will not many but some of us know the story of the the Fort chaplains rabbi Alexander good among them I'm tell that story because I think it's incredible and I'm not sure how many of our listeners have heard\nOkay ... and let me if I could just step back for one second ...\nThose those um something that that people don't understand and the story is a great example of that one of the things that people don't understand is that when we go into the military\nWere deliberately called intentionally called Chaplin not rabbit I mean we're advised fruits ministers what were called Chaplin so in that instance it was it unusual for me wherever I served to spend a good part of the day\nHelping people who are not Jewish I mean sometimes people who haven't had military experience I think that we're only like like every chaplain only care for their specific faith or denomination\nAnd the reality is far from that\nAnd and so here let's let's segue into there there was a ship called the Dorchester it had been a a sort of a a supply ship before the war World War two rolls around and it's transformed into an army transport ship but it's in my book in the\nCage eighty four eighty five\nAnd so here you have\nFor chaplains one rabbi and free ministers who are going to go on the ship with a nine hundred\nA man who are going to serve in Europe\nAnd it's a January and unfortunately at this time but this is part of World War two history of the Germans were using the suffering quite effectively and thinking a large number of our ship so many of our ships never made it across\nThe Atlantic to Europe and so the captain of the ship called the door Chester was aware that they were in an area where submarines were active and he basically says or we're going to start ... through the water\nBut I Want everyone to go to sleep with their full uniform on and their life jackets\nJust in case it well I I find that people when I'm Talking lived to them that often people don't know when when you go to sleep\nYou don't have a better than it mattress you have something called the rack and they've returns which is just a piece of steel voted for the war would you drop down and then you rely on that and if everyone would just imagine going to sleep with your regular clothes on and then that's your shoes\nIt's been going to sleep with your regular clothes on and then that's your shoes and socks and maybe a jacket or maybe a raincoat\nWell the soldiers were down in the the ... the chef and um they over the over the died started taking off their a life jacket somebody took off their shoes on and on and on with stuffy down there unfortunately around one AM in the morning\nAnd this is early February Nineteen forty three of the ship it's hit\nAnd it's it was a torpedo unfortunately and such a place that um they're told to abandon ship now again unfortunately this isn't a cruise ship this was the ship that had maybe a enough life\nLife both for two hundred of the nine hundred so again it's unimaginable that chaos that they they were jolted out of their sleep out of their slumber and the lights were flashing and they literally have about Mm\nTwenty thirty seconds to go from the lower decks of the ship climb up ladders get on the the the the deck of the ship the top deck and jump into the lifeboats now the chaplains had been an upper level so they were sort of more prepared to\nHandle what they were supposed to end their job was to help those soldiers\nGet on these lifeboats and now I understand that everyone kind of knew that if the ship was thinking not only did you have to get in the lifeboat but you had a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The DeSimone Daily Double", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "28"}
