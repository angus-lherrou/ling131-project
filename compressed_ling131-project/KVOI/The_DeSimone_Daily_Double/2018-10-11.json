I Am better than all those I differ with and I am a I Am better in that\nAnd this is more important than normal middle class Sybil are the rules do not apply to me\nThen that will that inevitably

go to ... for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAll right my friends this is my theory or read to you from the the psychological journal and it's all over the place higher self esteem\nBetween two groups of high self esteem and less self esteem to hire self esteem it'd be more violent these are all psychologist and I'm In a serious academic journal you can find it elsewhere as well it makes perfect sense how can you hurt somebody unless you think you're better than them\nYou don't hurt people you think your worst then write the murderer thinks you know\nWho are you owe me I can murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I can you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are very offended when they're arrested there just offended I Can't believe who the hell are you to arrest me\n\nAll right now Julie Julie are you in Alaska\nIn our\nAh right so we got to teach our screener that eight K. is Alaska a are is Arkansas okay\nI thought well I'm going to be professional [noise]

comfortable here you are in fact that was something I said almost every day to them remember who you are when you see different things meaning you're a child to God and\nYou are part of the family so um I guess we have very high so I only huh and so someone different greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me\nIf it's if it's truly something that I blame it doesn't really bother me that I never thought of myself as violent in any way that I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI Want to let me know or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams\nIt's ridiculous\nOkay so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be hard with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child with God I promise you know okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image\nThis gives us the certain pressure ... that is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it the self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific and we you know all the things you're even laughing at that so that that proves my point\nYou're even laughing that that so that that proves my point so visit there at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in earned his self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done\nGood then you should think highly\nOr or well of your achievement that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nYeah okay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved\nIrrespective of religion vast can sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference I don't see evangelical Christians going\nOut there and screaming at a legislate tours or pro choice that stopping their dinners don't see evangelical Christians going out there and screaming at a legislate tours or pro choice than stopping their dinners they the\nAnd we're not even just to make a state reading this when I write\nFor a black American to say we're proud of the
