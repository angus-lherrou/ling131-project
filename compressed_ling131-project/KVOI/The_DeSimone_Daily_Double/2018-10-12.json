I think it's more of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's nice but I was just curious well\nOne of the reasons we love the Americans\nYou know [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're feeling down just scorn of American radio station act exactly\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the more storms full of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won why don't you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I tell people I was surprised I was less surprise than most I had included mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth to us than my own experience of going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and what finally had told me they thought Donald Trump was going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless ... chance of winning\nUh so I was I I must admit I Would still I'm surprised but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance to conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been at the polls go back and forth we've been uh you know within the margin of error and a lot of them um [noise] the the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government\nI think the issues are on our side of the barrier faith in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that\nUm you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network is MSNBC in Canada\nUm is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec if you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario you would not imagine that concert party is going to get any votes at all and yet they won the election and won it handily\nSo I'm a I'm optimistic but a book I leave a\nI leave the day to day up Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew Sharon go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider a conservative in Europe this comes up\nAnd sometimes they say if only we have talk radio Europe\nWhy isn't there in Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio in Canada\nWill talk radio does exist in ... well I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah no no ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio hosts not all of them but a lot of our best ones are have been\nKind of at the state where they're retiring in recent years but look at an area where there really is a deficiency generally and what's interesting a dentist about this is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well in terms of audience like white conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of\nNeedy and conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that\nThe dying media continues to cater to cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful ... you said earlier I did not pass over me at all all of our beauty or MSNBC I Hope my sister's caught that one that I look I Am well aware of that\nSo there is however and I are frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately a lot of its day to day reporting and calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I\nI Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of the day to day coverage of federal politics but its editorial rely lined remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah you have to know a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast\nUm you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians were always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it's kind of the the the low number and so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of\nOf outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me in fact the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that the caller link to the same\nDoesn't exist in Canada is that because certainly not to the same thing right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left right there for in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued how why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalized Asians about our country but it's a fact that Canadian have the more civil public discourse and always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or hurt or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that was for between party significantly bigger and Canada plug that I think the other factor that often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two party and that really changes\nWhat one of intelligence comes out of the universities Steven Pinker Harvard says the the left his baby university a laughing stock man to liberal atheist professor of psychology very popular writer\n\nI don't think I don't I don't of course I don't he wouldn't agree with me that that's the reason for it but to have is the ... you you tell me the reason\n\nLast
