Tom good morning rabbi we started talking last week about the phenomenon of ultra right or the nationalist tribalism I think there's a turn that you used a that's developed a variety of places all around the globe\nAnd its impact um where it's come from and its impact also in the Jewish communities in those places I'm not sure where to begin and sort of spreading various places but maybe Eastern Europe might be the best place to be well\nOkay so you spent some significant time in Poland this summer and you saw a thriving and if anything growing and flourishing Jewish community in a country that was once widely considered hotbed of anti Semitism\nAnd polls by themselves or basically a hundred percent Catholic and nationalist and now at least fairly right wing\nBut the question is OK so being right wing doesn't necessarily translate into violent anti Semitism being in a country governed by a white ... a right wing government doesn't necessarily mean that life gets worse for the Jews but\nHistorically it's been dangerous for Jews because historically what has happened to burning extreme right wing\nThis happened to bring the extreme right wing parties to power and to have a right wing government in place is great social strain whether that's economic political military whatever the sense that the society is under siege and\nThat the danger of collapsing old ways are in danger of disappearing and we have to clean on fiercely\nTo what we already know because their safety and what we know and there's a danger in the unknown in that atmosphere that set of attitudes certainly is what brought Hitler to power it brought other notoriously\nBad evil right wing regimes to power over the years and I think what's interesting in terms of looking at the world today and the resurgence of right wing extremism as well as sort of identity politics and tribalism is that the world as a whole as it becomes increasingly\nWe continue with our two Jewish update on news of
