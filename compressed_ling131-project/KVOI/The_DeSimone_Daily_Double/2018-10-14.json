radio dot com and now here's rabbi Sam go on and two Jewish [noise]\nShallow I recently returned from Shanghai, China where\nThe high holy days services Shabaab events classes and other programs work he lied Shanghai the only progressive synagogue in Shanghai\nThere was a remarkable and highly enjoyable experience for many reasons not least of which that I was leading a small Jewish congregation and the largest and most dynamic city and the whole world\nThere are twenty four million people living in Shanghai proper another ten million and the larger metropolitan area that is an awesome city that works and is an incredibly vital place economically and culturally\nOne of the most intriguing things about China was that every July ... said approximately the same thing\nThere is no anti Semitism in China in fact people tend to say there's a kind of biased in favor of Jews a pro or buy low Semitism that leads Chinese people the thing that Jews are smart capable and good business ...\nThese are very high values in today's China\nThere are more than fifty books in Chinese that advertise that they teach the Jewish way to do business and there is a city in China credited with inventing Chinese banking it's colloquially referred to as a Jewish city although it has no Jews\nBanking is considered a great fiscal accomplishment of Jews are understood you have invented it originally huh\nThe Chinese also believed Jews are excellent and raising smart capable successful children a friend suggested a death in the future best seller in China would be the Jewish mothers guide to raising successful children it wouldn't have to be published in English it all just Chinese there's definitely a huge market for it\nOn rare occasions that seems old stereotypes can actually be a benefit\nWhich helps explain why during World War two there was no objection from the Chinese government to accepting Jewish refugees and fairly large numbers creating the so called Shanghai Ghetto\nChina wasn't wealthy then it surely is on the way to being so now there are more exotic automobiles on the streets of Shanghai that in New York Beverly Hills in London combined bought back during World War two living standards weren't what Jews from Vienna Berliner Warsaw we're used to experiencing\nBut there was no persecution by the Chinese and even when the Japanese conquered Shanghai conditions were equally difficult for everyone in fact you sometimes headed better than the Chinese did under Japanese military occupation\nAnd although we Jews have always been a small minority everywhere\nWith the exception of Israel and certain boroughs of New York city the experience of minority hood in China is more intensive by several ... orders of magnitude there are between three thousand and five thousand Jews in Shanghai out of a population of twenty four million\nThat translates to point two percent\nAbout two out of every ten thousand people are Jewish that's a really tiny minority at a huge world class city\nWhich means that if you want to retain your Jewish identity and teach your children you have to choose to do so willingly and consistently you're not going to be actively Jewish\nWillingly and consistently you're not going to be actively Jewish by accident as you can be in some places in the world are by simply doing what your neighbors are doing you don't have to find refuge from anti Semite with other Jews because that's not the reality in China\nThat's two seven six five six seven five or go to bait seem hot Tucson dot org\nJoined in the

from the apple I tune store is very popular Jewish podcast top ten in America according to ... magazine\nWe welcome Amir eaten head of the ... center are maven on his ... book hero by so now that all the holidays are\nBehind us it's time to think about are going to Israel um you're leading a trip to hold leading a trip to Israel all with many many other people um tell us about the trip but so so so\nWhy in your view or it's important to go to Israel\nUm I think it's very simple you know first of all the rights of Israel center really emphasize on a building relationship with Israel and with Israelis and you can't really build relationships with that person to person contact\nUm a learning about Israel in a classroom is wanting visiting is around and seeing in your own eyes and are experiencing from your your own eyes and build your own story of Israel is important in my eyes and I can show would you just one small thing\nThat uh I'd be in a classroom teacher for many many years middle school and high school and I've I've talked about Israel was one of the topics and I when I had like a mother and these are the class\nAnd as I can sit there and talk about you know ... in the military operation that started you know just to bring back home a three teenagers were kidnapped\nBy we happen to be in Israel would you live in graders and we happened to be one of the special forces they went out to search for them and we went to an empty base and when the children asked me to teens asked me mystery than\nWhat's going on why is this base empty\nAnd I said the truth they're all out they're searching for our brothers so this is something that you know you can't teach in the classroom\nAnd die strongly encourage every listener of our program I have to go through these rather go along with your family go with ... center but just to go to Israel it's very important to go with your synagogue go with your synagogue of course with any organization no I think it's a reward the better\nYou know uh in leading a trip or there's so many different ways you can go a okay everybody is going to go to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv right [laughter] that's a given yeah they found a it's a law you go to the sun and yet you got people who are there for the first time of rising sea or the galley see ... I'm\n... all of those but that's not really the most important\nPart of Israel uh although hard to argue with Drew Sloan right what do you think the most important connection people make as\nWell to be honest or you know there are two things one is of course you know covered the subtraction covered the things that are most important the holiest places rivalries lord of the of course\nBut but I I actually have a different angle outside of the box which is I think you know to to look at your passion\nTo pass and what does it you like because Israel yes it's the Jewish state than a very special place\nBut it's a country with people who wake up in the morning and go to work and provide to their families and play sports and you know and and read together and hyped together\nOur loan and they do things that we do and that so I think that if you look at your passions and you try to match them and you go and you visit real people you know because you need to hit us time and and that that that that uh\nHave the same interest and have the same passion and then you not only visit to Israel but you bring Israel backpack home with you you have a great way to the\nThanks so much on there and we'll talk next week You're welcome we welcome our expert\nOn the international Jewish seen Tom Price ... good morning rabbi we've been talking the last couple of weeks about this resurgence of nationalism tribalism and last week you talked about the tremendous change in the last century I think you could even narrow it down there's tremendous technological change right now that's affecting people all over\nAnd the reaction to it is sometimes to drop back into old established traditional values a shot of the past will save us from all of this change\nUm I I Want to get a little more specific about some of the places where we've seen this kind of resurgence\nUm we talk kind of briefly about Eastern Europe last week but um [noise] you know we don't talk very much about what's happened to the Jews and while I guess across the former Soviet Union but\nIt's a very strange place to be right now if you're Jewish I think in part because of these kind of weird national reactions\nAre behind the iron curtain might be a better description\nRight well what was traditionally long before the Soviet times it was ... soil yeah OK but that might have been the most anti Semitic country in the world and that that that soil\nWhether it's in Ukraine or Bella rose or Russian Federation whatever the soil in the air seem impregnated with anti Semitism anti Semitism seems to flow\nIn mother's milk in those countries and it's you know it I think waxes and wanes with the times but certainly\nLook it's fair to say the countries that are more economically vulnerable\nUm countries which are undergoing more traumatic social and economic change such as all the post communist countries while you're talking Cuba Russia\nChina's not post communist country it's still a communist country because I'm In a capitalist so some of the heating more in the capitalist world I mean these countries\nAre undergoing humongous social strain and they um don't necessarily have the wherewithal to cushion the way a western\nCountry that's more prosperous like Sweden or Switzerland or even the United\nStates might shoes to cushion um\nAnd then that's a question of government policy but some countries just don't have the me and\nYou know the difference between a twenty five year old person living in China and Seventy five year old person living in China\nIs like the difference between an earth Lincoln a Martian\nRight um one grew up in the age of computers and cell phones and whatever and and doesn't feel threatened by that diverse clothing and styles and fashions a he or she may feel out of the mainstream and cut off from opportunity but not the sense of threat or even panic\nThat many older people feel\nAnd what what I think you're seeing\nIs two things there's a growing divergence between young and old generations\nDoesn't prevent all the young people from becoming far right but there's also a growing divergence between rich and poor that's almost worldwide and only the countries that control that very carefully countries that we would label\nIn a denigrating way a socialist countries you know horrible places like the Netherlands Denmark Sweden whatever ... only those countries those countries where people are happiest by the way right now and\nWhere there's universal healthcare and universal access to higher education and ... countries do much better on standardized tests of science and math than our citizens but those countries\nManaged to\nLimit the disparity between rich and poor and between the younger and older generation managed to provide their citizens with a greater sense of continuity and comfort\n\nYou know the one thing I can say that these are interesting times thanks time we will talk next look forward to it it's time now for our old Jewish joke of the week Jewish humor you're ... brought you buy two Jewish as a public service [noise]\nRabbis in the hospital ... critically ill congregants demand ... has been an important member of the show for decades the rabbis close to him suddenly moisture into the editing unable to speak motions for the rabbi to come close thinking he will hear the man's last request the rabbi does so but with a tube in his mouth shut can't speak\nThe rabbi do so but with a tube of his mouth wish it can't speak the rabbi grabs a pad of paper and pencil hands at the militia the dying man scribbles furiously but just as he finishes the note gives it to the rabbi the alarms go off the monitors show no heart rate Moshe collapses and dies\nAnd all the hubbub
