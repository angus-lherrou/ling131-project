Jewish radio Eighteen edge emailed dot com or visit us on the Web at two Jewish radio dot com\nAnd now here's rabbi Sam go on and two Jewish\nShow I've had some amazing Jewish experiences over the last couple of months and sometimes it feels I\nWon't be able to share them adequately with you here on two Jewish because there's always something new to talk about in the Jewish world or at least mine\nThe most recent trip to London to pick up the Torah for our new congregation they'd seen how was particularly fascinating and our guest this morning Jeffrey Orenstein the chairman of the memorial scrolls trust will tell us a big part of that story today\nBut my experience in Shanghai over the holidays in September included so many stories I haven't yet been able to share with you and that's true even for those days in London last week\nNow we're starting a new synagogue beginning well it began last week actually which creates its own flood of stories and events\nAnyway I'll start to catch up at least on those China in England tales today by sharing a couple of small Jewish worlds stories\nAt the conclusion of Russian an evening services back in September in Shanghai, China a couple approached me with their adult son and told me they had been members of my father's synagogue temple a menu well in Beverly Hills where he was the cancer for twenty five years\nAnd then my dad inducted their son's bar mitzvah some Thirty years ago\nIt turned out that in ... he lost Shanghai which is not a particularly large mostly expatriate community we had about two hundred people for services there was another man who would also grown up and my dad show and I met him money and the poor\nAnd then during the taste of Judaism class that I taught at the ... house in Shanghai I met a young man who went to Amherst College with my nephew Jeremy was friendly with him and saying and another op appellate group justice Jeremy did\nThese encounters took place in Shanghai, China literally six thousand miles from Los Angeles and about nine thousand miles from Massachusetts\nWe truly are wandering Jews and sometimes it seems are only about three degrees of separation between all of us\nAmong many other wonderful memories of my time in Shanghai including observing ... with young Jews by the latest Leon and looming needed high rises on the banks of the one who river in Shanghai singing with in conducting an ad hoc Jewish musical group including a bassoon a Chinese violin called an air who\nGuitar and two voices\nAnd then spending ... totally different parts of that huge an incredibly dynamic in diversity oh and building a ... with a group of about thirty parents spinning the students and various and sundry enthusiastic younger kids\nOne leg of that circle was angry by a ... table a first in my experience and quite possibly in all of human history anyway great memories in China\nPerhaps the most unusual of all the unique experiences with Judaism and China took place my final evening in Shanghai it was the first night of suit coat it coincided with the moon cake festival the Chinese celebration of the harvest and the full moon\nCakes vegetable a Chinese celebration of the harvest and the full moon\nSince these two holidays actually have a great deal in common the joined event was sponsored by the Israel China chamber of commerce which is quite an operation itself in Shanghai\nPlus representatives of the Israel China chamber of commerce from Beijing and many Chinese business and governmental partners and officials plus ski lodge Shanghai the congregation I was serving\nWhat we do know is that a lesser was sent to the communities with the agreement to Nazis of calls to bring anything into\nRock however when you look at it that it actually it actually\nMotor skills but everything symbols in the community from from the very real society um to those people doing circumcision so we feel that many of us feel that it was really they were talking about keeping these roles\nAre hoping to come back and correct them hoping they will survive 'em but in any event it was a meeting of minds the officers were happy for them to be collected in one place and the Jews obviously happy for them to be safe in my case\nWe will continue this fascinating exploration and memorials for all trust these checks rolls of Tara ah with Jeffrey or seen when

welcome are ... on Israel on their ... head of the winter of Israel center talking to us from Israel where he's leading a trip\nA Booker tov although for you it's a ... to write it is almost like lots of getting close so I Know it's been a wonderful trip because every trip to Israel is extraordinary but there was a kind of a powerful reminder that as wonderful as experience you're having there now is uh things aren't always so great tell us about that yeah so\nUm yesterday at four AM my my parents living in Russia has a woke up with the sirens went off in the entire city there were rockets launched from Gaza towards Israel or one of them are fortunately it ended at a house\nOr in my um parents neighborhood I saw the hurt the card lending explosion in the you know it's not a resident experience something that you know I Know that ... in Tucson night on experience and a woman with three children uh the youngest one year old will have to grab\nTheir children and run into a secure a room or in our house that was built to basically a save lives and uh she said the lives of her children in the house was destroyed or twenty kilograms or expose it wow that will send them to sign\nOn the rocket they're not missiles because they're really not aimed to just shut out to drone ...\nHeard the other side you know without any er any target for a military base so soldier\nIt's sort of indiscriminate attacks on civilians opposite\nOf you know it's er or crime and then uh my younger brother\nWho has ah two daughters and a seven year old and a ten year old I had to run out from his apartment to a shelter nearby for him in the morning you know I'm sure that our audience and your listeners are can understand that this is not something that you aren't anyone that you love care to go\nTell us just briefly is if that happens to you and Israel that you know your your home is exploded by a terror rocket their insurance policies as the government help like how does it work\nThe first thing that happened to have the government agencies coming in to help you or you know the faster they can't uh it is their insurance insurance of\nCourse it's just a reminder as incredible as Israel is as beautiful as fast developing that there's still there's terror threat from a from Hamas from has bowl or have to look\nAnd you know our our government cabinet a place where we are speaking now you know they're they're making and the prime minister and ministry of defense then obviously\nIraq officer or with plans and what to do um Israel gates attack twenty targets in Gaza are one of the tunnel and one can ask can sell for ourselves you know you know about the Donald\nWhy don't you just go to Tom all the time I was going to be used against you but then comes politics and then you know responsibility to ... what do we do escalate that is going to attack you not to go on to its act\nUm in or not it's it's a very in good shape they cancelled the school for ... for a day I'm next to guys on the Seventeen and those guys are no schools as well ...\nAnd everything can happen you know are you going to the Egyptians I mean I Know gay chips and we're about to send their representatives to ah to Israel because she could visit Gaza but he can still do it I don't know the reason\nFor hope when we talk next week we can have happier news makes so much on the safe trip\nWe welcome our expert on the international Jewish seen Tom Price going Tom good morning rabbi we've been talking about this\nInternational tendency towards a tribalism as you put it or just regular nationalism I'm In an era of very rapid technological change and social change [noise] engendered by it and by the things\nWe haven't really addressed Western Europe where it's having an impact not quite as obvious as it is in Hungary or Poland or\nFormer Soviet Union areas or China perhaps but definitely having an impact\nRight well we're obviously trying to keep away from certain parts of the world which is probably a good thing but [laughter]\nUm so what do for example Spain Italy and France have in common one thing they have in common is it for many centuries\nThe Roman Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in those countries and the monarchs were crowned by the pope another thing they have in common is a high level of corruption whether it's admitted or not and another thing they have in common is a resistance to making\nFundamental changes in the social safety network and\nLabor law et cetera et cetera that would make their economies more modern and more competitive on a global level\nSo why is unemployment so high particularly among people under thirty\nI mean it's unbelievably high in Spain or France if it ever got to those numbers in the United states\nOur country will go up the smart one right now the euro\nSort of helps keep those countries together and means that the rich are more productive countries which really have modernize their economies Germany for example or\nSweden or Holland or Denmark those countries basically subsidize the poor southern countries that have been more reluctant to modernize and you see in McAllen himself\nThis combination of really progressive forward looking guy and an almost reactionary air to Charles de Gaulle in some ways as well I mean he was very curious almost gets a friend that mixture and that may be what's required to govern France\nBut also and this may not be terribly well known to most Americans Spain France\nWell known to most Americans Spain France and Italy are all sort of\nCages of multiple nationalities that are kind of\nBone to a central state and the central language but it's not everybody's first language and neither French nor Spanish\nNor Italian is really everybody's chosen language and those are not the answer is alone or not terribly long ago right I mean there's the cuts Alon separatists movement there used to be a very violent Basque separatists ... movement the boss still have their own identity and they would still probably like\nOn a ton of this region that straddles the border between France and Spain\nBut they certainly don't consider themselves Spaniards\nAnd then there are other regions are under Lucille the least year they have actually different languages which the custodians have tried for five hundred years or so to suppress\nFrom ordering meals from the outside when there is a cook on staff\nCurrently indictment filed back in June by attorney general at the high ... sorry that's on Yahoo is aware she was violating the rules when she or the meals her attorneys have said she did not know she was violating rules\nThis investigation began way back in twenty fifty and after the state controllers office issued a report and then it's on Yahoo family household expenses\nNewtown Yahoo's had denied any wrongdoing and accused Israel's public broadcaster of airing fake news campaign of character assassination\nThere was a most unusual Holocaust commemoration last week and then it was neither ... nor painful\nIn Copenhagen, Denmark they mark the Seventy fifth anniversary of the Danish rescue of nearly all their Jews from the Nazis at the great synagogue of Copenhagen celebration was filled with songs speeches in celebration including ovations for both crown prince Frederick and ... the president of Israel\nOctober eleventh Nineteen forty three the Danes informed that the Nazis planned to round up all the Jews that small country within a week organized he flotilla small boats mostly fishing craft and rescue nearly all of this Seventy two hundred Danish Jews my smuggling them to Sweden over just a few days\nOr there was some reason for morning fifty one Danish Jews were murdered by the Nazis and the Holocaust there is much more ongoing pride in justifiable joy and the fact that a small country Denmark saved more than Ninety nine percent of its Jews from the Germans\nThe ceremony this week ended with an upbeat performance by a girls choir from a Jewish school they saying oh session alone and patriotic Danny song written by national author Hans Christian Anderson\nThe ceremony has some sad news for those who didn't make it and for our brother and who perished said ... from ... a kindergarten teacher whose mother was rescued indiscreet Danish rescued the Jews and inevitably it's also a celebration of the rescue without which most of the people here would not be alive today\nThroughout most of Europe police help the Nazis killed Jews from Burke said here in Denmark police help the Jews escape the Nazis of course this has a profound effect on how a Jew feels growing up in this society\nYou know a personal note I knew a Jewish woman who had been rescued by the Danes in those hectic days during World War two Jews Jewish educator an excellent one who was eternally grateful to Denmark and encouraging decency that people Seventy five years later that Greek collected back remains a beacon of hope\nGood can trial even when least expected\nAnd that's the two Jewish News of Jews round the world [noise]\nWe're delighted to welcome back to two Jewish or I guess this morning Jeffrey are seen as the chairman and memorials scrolls trust the organization that terrorists for distributes ah documents and displays or check memorials frills rescued from\nI'm really from communist uh\nI guess just interests more than anything else collected during the Holocaust by the check\n'em museum at your cesium and now available and many synagogues around the world including a argue synagogue ... facing a\nUm ... you know you there's so many stories associated with the girls I think the story of the original so fair describing repair this girl's is one of the great stories can you share that one with a K\nWill win ... games in London um they they were originally we examined by about nine scribes to see what could be used you couldn't be [noise] and the the ones that were either\nKosher a suitable for four years over the easily be repaired we've dealt with but then there was this vast number of which we had a problem with\nAnd we didn't have the ability to carry on with work and then a couple of months later um there was not allowed to end the story is is there is a a wondering scribe who came from Israel and he was looking for work\nVery hard to advance go any rented Israeli embassy which is about a mile away from here asking if they could recommend a synagogue and they sent this to us\nAnd he notes on at all which was open [noise] so I buy a lady who Schaffer whose father was a ...\nA poet as she spoke with other languages including edition Hebrew which were there any languages or David Bryant spoke\nAnd David officers said look he said come from is on the sofa that I'm a scribe do you have a scroll a racket or bad or you can imagine the rest is history\nWell quite a history I mean it wasn't was girl I was Fifteen hundred year old and a nice word he spent the next Thirty years working on\nThis nearly said he is he came back was in the woods and in fact the community at various times were even able to to rent is little flaps his wife would join him and as I say he he worked for close on that he is um doing the most amazing job raising\nNow of course a while some of these girls initially could be made a kosher a share six to the level at which they can use regularly for synagogues or that was a an elaborate process\nUm how many girls have been centered around the world now how many are still here are and what kind of condition\nOkay so of the Fifteen hundred and sixty four schools we allocate said something like fourteen hundred of these schools and this goes can be found\nIn pretty well every every continent to the world\nYou can find them from Australia to South Africa and using it on Argentine Chitty Brazil um of course in Europe and Israel from space it's a um and\nMost importantly I suppose for your for your ... this is a there are in Canada and of course the U.S where we have one of the thousands goes and it just in the U.S\nThose scrolls the goal is not necessarily for them to be on display but to be used is that correct\nYes I think that of the of the schools that first came\nAbout ten percent of the fish as it could be used a rich rich early in the service I'm\nIn my mind you they had been stored at that point for Seventeen your memorial will maybe closer to Twenty years\nYes oh yes and well ... they might have you need a small amount of are bad but they were pretty ... pretty good shape but the the rest varied in from being in a reasonable condition to even being fragment\nTool and um that\nYou can open it um impossible to use 'em and it was decided that um it was good for the remainder about a hundred and ... the schools we would create a check memorials goes museum which we keep hearing we we have here in London at the trust\nAnd the location of trust by his can't house at Westminster synagogue I should note that a museum was my for my great uncle and ask former apartment actually they're flatter\nRight as directed at least we still have a bedroom\nYou over the rabbi to survive as a\nAs a unique place on these girls are often have a Providence you know where they come from correct\nWhen when the schools were collected were were shipped into the Jewish museum in Prague and Nineteen forty two not the the Jewish I'm ... and employees under the control of the Nazis\nActually recorded every ... now\nThe school didn't come alone not sure that there was some two hundred thousand items came into Prague Nineteen forty two and two hundred thousand a hundred thousand items and it's still searching buildings\nAnd they weren't just schools that were just the the the covers the silver they included books they included um um furniture pianos I'm back it's everything from the Jewish community so everything every single Eisen was recorded was attack\nUnfortunately from our perspective over the years because when the communists came in they moved it was it solves the same photographers survey towers atomic schools with them and they move into the White House so during the time the suffers move backwards and forwards\nUnfortunately many of the the scrolls lost their identity tax\nSo out of the Fifteen hundred and sixty four schools we received over two hundred a unfortunately I'm lost the identity tags and we call these often scrolls\nSo we don't know rich town they came from\nWe know that there are almost all of them from ... uh uh the area that we think of today's the Czech Republic or those kinds of old bigger than today's Czech Republic and a little smaller than Czechoslovakia was um ... is a little bit about that Jewish community because this is really an incredible\nResource and window into that community", "show_name": "The DeSimone Daily Double", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "21"}
