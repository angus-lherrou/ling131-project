I'm ... weeks ago and in fact a week before that they were hearing rumors that something was happening that if there was going to be some kind of mobilization but they weren't certain\nAnd another thing that I found very interesting was that there were some according to the people that I spoke with now remember I still have to investigate that\nThere were people within the United states people that belong to and she oh eight department official that we're very close to and I'll let just leaning groups that were older son how on the outskirts\nInvolved in this according to people that I've spoken with you know some of the groups NGOs that work out their supplying food and water a passing out aid to the migrants on the buses that costs a lot of money nobody's gonna but people for free\nThat some of these NGOs were involved with it and that may have come ...
