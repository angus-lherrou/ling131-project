I say that when it comes to religion and God I'll leave that morning Dennis but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails which what the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses\nOr you go back to high school to examine teenage behavior or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech or when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda of one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media have used that to pile on President Trump how they along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNone of them like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote\nThe threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new is not an aberration is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch us reverting Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are have preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke\nAnd they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violent conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves\nThese angry right wing Maine oh it's really focusing [laughter] have been openly hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lives even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the bombs were real [noise]\nSo that's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit before cross my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want it to anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he done that while conspiracies on the right\nName some real ones of course not they never name and how about left wing conspiracy it dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this this is when you may be familiar with that President Trump colluded with the Russians you've spent two years in that one and as far as I Know it's ...\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason on or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the ... attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox here he's picking on Fox out that I Want to defend them was former Obama official claim yeah that's what I ... to the President Trump's rhetorical helped lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sector state I wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president created an anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate but we're unjustified see at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know which side he's on an even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course\nAnd what some of them site is proof\nThe chance of lock her up\nThe phrase fake media Oregon worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way tell me in the crowd that crowd first because it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show where I was filling in for the week that I'd be willing to give her a path I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she ... bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never [laughter] I was being facetious I Would be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenge me and said I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that but you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further divisiveness if that's even possible future that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for actions and across to lock her up represent the average that people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go to you know he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so corrupt he's not by any means and incitement to violence\nYeah the charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stories that are not true the latest example that you hear this one NBC was hiding ... story evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's ... it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that she didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on Sean even hear that bit of news yeah\nThis so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of us\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer object to reporters and a part of some sort of left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nDoes to the detriment of the truth so for example our talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch this their children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever Porter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nOr at least people on your side say let's go I like this Alan in California Allan you're on
