you I mean I've been to Minnesota so many times I Love the state I live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota\nMinnesotans are known for niceness than they vote for a mean party [noise] right\nRight we we we just don't are really really nice people and they like they like balance and they like people that treat others with three back and we are we are a dream state where we we cross ballot though we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we\nWe cross over a Democrat Republican and we like to vote for big names here we've had Jesse Ventura as governor with Al Franken as us editor so ... and and I even in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grant at the same time they go to the most liberal senator\nAnd Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you and California got it\nOr you should [laughter] you I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison Keith Ellison is uh is is this far left as we have in American politics\nThat Keith Ellison of course has serious charges against him with regard to abusive a woman and I'm not saying they're true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident punished will that play out\nAnd write a I'm and I'm running actually\nFor that has to take me to Al Franken seat so there's a lot of responsibility in the seat and who represent Minnesota in the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and then Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrat because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault they're harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith is\nCampaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she has that because Keith categorically denied these accusations then Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the uh uh an substantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nAt sea any war under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI an investigation and she's also set that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to be innocent before proven guilty it's now August and the proof is not those that are accused and that's it that's the bad road that the Democrats have gone down it's going to discourage a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue\nI have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who or anti Kevin all on on the grounds of sexual assault ... for getting their against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDo they have husbands brothers fathers sons whom they love I mean why use all the identification visas the the the alleged victim\nAnd I we get into a group\nOf hockey on the other day and that's exactly what they were saying it\nAnd they fear for their husbands and their sons and their fathers that anybody can\nMake an accusation and it becomes the you're the land and a front page headlines and there are are guilty by just public accusation and\nNot having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attacked Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled that something like this\nUh comes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it is so deeply saddening emphasis on the road that they've gone down\nSo it is is the issue you have to climb the Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely the the tale that Tina Smith has to climate it hit such a metro area liberal elite that uh this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has left the Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul in that it not to\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party in the eighth district up on the iron range protests all historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressmen up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we what we're seeing a real red wave here uh because they got\nSo far to the left and they've left the people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nThat's going to be Republican so Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we we are seeing real red wave here ah because they got somebody in the lap and they ... on that not who we are here in Minnesota\nI I I just want to tell you what I said every Republican candidate for Senate for house governor\nThat you're not only running I mean this is unsolicited advice and I I I humbly acknowledge that fact but
