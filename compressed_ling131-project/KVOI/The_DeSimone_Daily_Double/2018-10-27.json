definitely a Republican pick up\nI think it is tied in Missouri I think that Indiana could be competitive or I Believe Montana will end up in the Democratic column\nI I didn't I didn't mention Montana that's going to take a lot more yeah\nAnd and the issue with Florida for your listeners is that the place that was destroyed\nWas the place that was the strongest Republican votes that there'll be fifty thousand or less Republicans voting because there are no places to vote to Arnold schools there is no electricity we are twelve days away for Thirteen Days away from\nThe election they don't even have only place\nAnd they've got no place to go\nI read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this and the one who wants to vote they will come and find you and let you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in this call the\nVoter registration let me talk to you about\nUm Martha Maxwell in Arizona or because I think Christian cinema\nThat is not fitness serves a based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to because I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction and I think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum\nAnd this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out efficient effective border security that has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over borders why is this still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting uh the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants what's so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of a barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border\nThen why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their oh I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audience is profound some pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audiences reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people that were in the country already or not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong tall fence with a road between it\nAnd I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience there you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very\nVery smart very apple and very educated very a Christian very they failed people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big farm and and you also it's also the other no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma\nI Know the good that they do the drugs we developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should a Republican say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refused to do it voluntarily the\nPublic does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not let what drug prices here as they've done it in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs\nUnder FDA supervision says nobody wants the hype might be poisoned\nBy the Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that won't change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability reminds you of conservatives who believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged\nThat's what you've got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of age age as has been a guest on my show what he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the uh new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done frankly\nMore than that needs to be done at least two in public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face ... does it help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still eat profitable but that people will be able to afford the medications they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nThe tired of all this money going into things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want in February noticed them and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they have seven
