now denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible imprisonment he may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully\nHe could be forced to resign this current traditional position because having a quote convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nOr some standard close to that a judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological or professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he can go back to his life it Robert Bork did\nBut if the Senate fails to confirm him now his

seat on the high court\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice\nNow listen to this is about the most fundamental issue a fair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nWhen innocent people were accused of trying to overthrow the government and have their lives ruined it based on false accusations while being denied all semblance semblance of due process or fairness\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism for demanding due process by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nWe have come a long way since McCarthyism\nBut we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor darker than McCarthy's\n\nThe left so turns out the

incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker\nThan that this is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes\nDuck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate that\nDo not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe that there's evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard you understand the difference folks there there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt that is for a conviction\nBut outside of the legal world all you need is ... I think in the ... or ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nIn civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nThat's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n\nIt's a very dark day in America to very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left but there's not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it that they owe you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but tell them yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence Mike ...
