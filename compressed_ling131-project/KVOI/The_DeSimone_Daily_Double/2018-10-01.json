something to add to the border conversation you know during testimony she was very confused and I don't mean confused about her testimony regarding God with all the first thing that she was that you know\nShe said was my lab some gaffe nobody asked for joining the cap and they got the Jamie I'm a ... or\nA cup of coffee which comes many different ways I mean I Would just come in law and order a I'd like to get things all these other person what you want yeah she also got to remember this point you got people asking the games\nIn a PHD what does that mean to you don't understand that they want to buy you\nWere going with a choice to the person would there be a pilot for ... grabbed his arm she also didn't understand the time on your behalf we garden anyone speaking for oh to Congress after she had taken that test well that one and she didn't understand the term\nScope of dairy evidence\nYeah the one on on your first thing you said about the coffee I I don't hold that against a actually that makes them look sympathetic in some ways but the thing I remember you are right when she said what does that mean on your behalf that kind of surprised me a little bit um\nWhat I mean not only not only the ... the lightning rod the prosecutor tried to explain it to work and she's still didn't get it\nYeah well you're you you make a point which is that there are a lot of things that are surprising but again as the other side which is if you micromanage anything uh a lot of us won't look that good right\nI I think it is key the only thing that the the interviewer or that's what I Want to say because she didn't seem like a prosecutor from each\nYou know the ones or what was her name the one the Republicans Mitchell yeah uh you know I was going to go somewhere with the whole thing you know very gently do everything and then ... and kind of shows she got her and all she got I guess the flights\nYou know that he or she said that she didn't want to come to Washington 'cause she's afraid of flying whenever it wasn't here she took all these slights so I thought she was going to pile on all these inconsistencies and I thought\nThey were gonna have to start to see like what I expected which probably is why she wasn't there and the second half right you guys all have great calls are are mostly yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota I'm sure you're on was marked\nHigh marks Hi how are you well good I'm\nOut of a couple of 'em that last caller was talking about her I'm hurting even her behavior\nUm I look at two different Hi Sheila how confused when they asked her if

wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect ... degrees a master's degree you know I\nThink I think there is a huge that um this threat maybe that's not the right one now but I I you know if it's\nDifferent than the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that um when they ask her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she got some health issues and I'm going to respect their health issue\nI don't care about this as a former fourteen year old girl even for cell phones that next we'll end what are called her and said well you\nKnow she I remembering eight miles from home well I should get home one of my friends you know I didn't\nLike it and she said that she was leading or at least give her a call and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that get very little holes in her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYeah were you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax in\nI yeah and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new rank and then she got my heart thing because I thought boy oh boy this is how director they go and\nYou know you were done for\nAnd I was so proud of Brett Kavanaugh teeming waivers and and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up ticket daughter pray I guess ... ... what would you not do it you were accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah but you can't prove a negative\nOf course and you can't win because\nThey would have said well he was accused of all these trips he didn't do it but now science thing and the other say I was to belligerent to be a justice if she can't win with
