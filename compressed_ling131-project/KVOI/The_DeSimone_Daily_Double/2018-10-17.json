forty percent up from ten percent of Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nWith at the core of it I mean by the way that's a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one their range of social science that make the indisputable point children particularly boys raised\nIn single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life\nTo develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be ... or ... or have out of wedlock Jill themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all\nAnd so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest that long term success for very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better\nArlene the Republican Party so focused on marginal tax rate they don't feel that sort of the province of ... they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggested single motherhood is\nLess preferable hum than\nUh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of allied unintentionally in downplaying we're going this problem dean while the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood I live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to maybe some of your listeners do and you know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody can divorced there no single moms on my street of course not because the ruling class understands that marriage\nIs the key to prosperity and happiness\nAnd said they don't practice\nDeath themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low the middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem not attacking anybody I'm saying if you really cared about the middle class and you would be doing whatever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children\nIntact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera\nSo I think that Republicans and incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realize hey we talk about social issues we're doomed\nBut ... but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was ... feet from that moment in Seoul now so I can from what you just said that that includes and they grew but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm a lower tax and other people are taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in the Congress and the president willing to sign it was very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up your civilization will collapse\nSo Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues you're in the army and you're a civil society grow out of the kind of\nLife you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on and because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants they didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nThe smart ones were what they regret it now\nOh really know what what leads you did what leads you to think that\nWell because I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks and there are a lot of really great people and people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past four years in America has not become more conservative\nAnd the smart ones are asking well where do we go wrong and it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they did it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nOnce you care about is the way people with the family is the very center it's the Adams in matters the court building block of every and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel funny asking you this but it's it's truly meant a lot of curiosity 'cause social respect you where do you stand on President Trump\n\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority the strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump said\nUm I think Tom's genius I think you need to understand from crisis at Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program in a lot so on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise about ... kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet style longer exists so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking the Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we start Afghanistan Seventeen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade\nThat er or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall it what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat the genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise or questions that we ought to be debated long after I'm gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first unit you you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I find a intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know what you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who will have on do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWant to know why read my first volume of five volumes that will eventually come out called the rational Bible\nRight through you're an atheist the best values in the world or in that book and I explained why\nWhen God chooses Abraham as the first gotta where human being\nFather of ultimately the Israel lights the Hebrew the Jews and then taken out of course by the New Testament he said through you all the families of the earth\nWill be blessed not all the individuals have deer all the families backs the basic unit\nMelvin chair that I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite products because I sit on it every day\nAt work when I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I sit on we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees well thank you which is nice in it of itself you could simply try it out go to ... chair dentist dot com\nThere is a thirty day guaranteed so you see Z to send back you do show no questions asked X chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...
