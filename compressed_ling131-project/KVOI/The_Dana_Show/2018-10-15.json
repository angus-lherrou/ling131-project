just too darn long and I thank you so much for being here it's a pleasure to be sitting face to face with you always a pleasure to be with you mark your long history you have a long story around\nI'm second generation of gun rights activists\nAdvocate of and uh my father was Neal knocks he was a gun writer and then was one of the moving forces behind the Cincinnati revolt in Nineteen Seventy something about the national Rifle Association listen to disappear information right that\nThat turn the national Rifle Association into a lobbying juggernaut\nUm then he uh\nFounded the firearms coalition which I now run 'em and eventually dad was elected on to the board of directors of the n._r._a. and became the vice president a man was in line to be the president the following year but he worried some people and so they recruited\n... he scares some people he didn't worry I'm your dad scared for people that are not\nRight they they went out and they recruited Charlton Heston specifically to run against dad so that they could bump him out of the chairs and\nKeep them from becoming the president of the n._r._a. that's pretty hardcore company when that's how important your father was that they actually did that with theft and that's what the soil yes we have more time for it and honestly [noise]\nBut now uh I uh I ... dad died in two thousand and five I'm I was helping him for the last two years of his life keeping the organization running and\nAnd helping with the day to day writing I have a regular articles on ah ah ... dot com and in firearms news magazine\nAnd ah the website and all of that firearms coalition dot org\nYou said firearms coalition dot org correct that's right firearms coalition dot org we've had some issues we actually had\nSomebody who claims to be a terrorist group hacked our website a few years ago and we never quite recovered from that my IT guy is a guy named Chris knocks or any relation yeah okay just checking\nMy my brother and uh he uh he's cheap but he's not really great so [laughter] but anyway we've we've revamp the website and it's looking really good\nBut for the last year\nI've been really focused on election politics rather than gun politics and I've I've kind of let the firearms coalition a\nSort of slide a little bit um and I apologize to any of our readers and and followers\nFor that but the election this year is so important and I am working full time to get good pro writes a candidate's elected to office this year\nBut let let me stop you were saying you because you've moved into election politics let's let's go there briefly absolutely I have spoken so far this great heavy hitters today Alan Gottlieb Alan Cohen and others are\nIn the election is dominating of course we're now you're talking about midterms national you're also talking about state you're talking about Arizona centric fill me on because this is a vital places as ground zero right now\nWell I moved the coalition back to Arizona I'm about six years ago and when\nI did I started getting much more involved in local Arizona politics and uh I actually have teamed up with a local a campaign consultant who work strictly with conservative candidates\nAnd um it turns out that concerted the candidates are also pro writes candidates and so I have no\nUh problems are working with these campaigns and ads supporting these guys in primarily in local politics we had a couple of congressional candidates unfortunately our candidates didn't ah get through the primary\nUm so now I'm focused on making sure that the Arizona house is as pro rights as it can\nPossibly ... and how close are we in your estimation to that happening because I Want to segue ... depending on your answer I'm gonna do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well so where are we where are we here locally\nNow here in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut ah as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no those let's use the state now you feel comfortable about the state\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe with the governor is going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's ... better than the alternative\nYou know you would that nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump loved it and call the election the night of the election on on my radio program I said go to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning\nThree hundred and ... I still have people that I'm proud of this asking me to pick their lottery numbers for him [laughter] All right let's go now let me segue to this to the federal election I I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half year\nIn the Arizona as in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the\nWhat was in a strange place very when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the easy CDL meeting ... meeting someone who would have ever found that in bright red gun toting gun loving history of the gun state Arizona\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a\nDemocratic socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office\nShe's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate and he wanted to spend enough money to get elected and running around with when it can you stay here with me for one more second sure you've our good because that\nHave national absolutely implications because what we're talking about here is the puts that you're talking to one vote ... one vote now it looks like Heidi Heitkamp is buried\nI think she's about John I'm hopeful Jon Tester right now is it about a one point raised Montana you're listening right now in every major city in Montana please go to the polls what are you doing Montana I've been kind of hard on your on the daytime show but my gosh it when I think of Montana I think a lot about what to think of Arizona\nRugged outdoors\nPlug it individual as a state built on the gun I think of the west I think a ... but kept okay by a bunch of bunch of guys that could shoot better with Winchester model Ninety four is okay the but the fact of the matter is or eighty floors wherever they were but the fact of the matter is\nWhy do we have to worry about that out here we shouldn't even be having this conversation here in the great state of Arizona Jeff disc concerns me and there's a couple\nOf reasons why we have this problem and one of them one of the biggest is that the Republican Party here in Arizona is rather torn it's dysfunctional we've got [noise] crazy right wing radicals we've got\nRight wing nuts so crazies and then we've got moderate me she ... she John McCain Republicans and we're always fighting with each other\nBecause we're used to fighting with each other within the party and the party can't get its act together and um that means that we can't unify behind a good candidate and and stick with it\nThat there's a big wing of the Republican Party in Arizona that thinks that the base isn't enough\nAnd they they they want to run for the middle in order to win and they hold up John McCain Jon Kyl Jeff Flake as examples of see that's what the Arizona people want\nWhat I'm hearing from you right now I'm I'm picturing in my mind radio to me is the editor of the mind and I I'm just trained in doing that when I'm listening to you I'm visualizing a puzzle\nOkay and I'm seeing three or four pieces in the state of Arizona in Arizona put together in three or four pieces based on what I'm hearing from you that it has it seems like Arizona\nIs now searching for a new identity\nBased on that base that you're you're talking about several different bases here right or John McCain voter would never vote for a mix Sally\nAmok Sally voter would never vote for a cinema at the scene three or four different McCain voter would vote for Mick cello they want to have to\nBut but a a um uh but they're not allowed in order to do a graph Goldwater voter back in the day would never vote for either of them McCain has\nSaid this is the here's what I'm Talking about [noise]\nI'm very concerned about what I'm seeing in the ... and I'm going to be honest it upsets me it really does because this is this is a\nArizona to me it's a free state in the country it is to me that's why I live here okay and I don't like what I'm seeing here and we had our core when talking about bringing the California is bringing in California\nValues that there is demographic change happening here which is what's happening in Montana as well it's happening in Montana's west also happening in a more sort of see it in Idaho what's been happening in Colorado for a long time\nAnd what amazes me as you get these goofy left his moves that leave what they don't like to go somewhere they like and bring their goofy left this ...

I'm not by will suffer I Am conservative and I am have some faith I don't I'm not a theologian yep but uh\nYou know there's good and evil in the world and if God had control over everything that went
