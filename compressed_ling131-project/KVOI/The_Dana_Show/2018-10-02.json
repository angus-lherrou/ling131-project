increased risk of heart disease and kidney disease and high blood pressure and diabetes and even stroke that's according to the national heart lung and blood Institute's when I found\nMy pillow I started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I just fell asleep faster and I\nThought I'm never using another pillow again the difference is real and you have to experience it for yourself\nConcerning that that that could delay matters a but assuming the FBI reports are consistent with the sworn testimony you know the three ... witnesses that Dr Ford identified\nA she named ... ... potential fact witnesses all three of them\nGave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee under penalty of perjury under penalty of five years in prison if they were lying and every one of the fact witnesses who she identified disputed her story including\nA one woman who is a longtime friend of hers and who says she doesn't know\n... having on it and it has no recollection of ever been any party with judge Kavanaugh that that particular\nA from a witness who had no incentive to lie about every incentive to back up those allegations um that I think is quite significant than and assuming that the FBI investigation revealed the same and I think we have every reason to expect that\nUh that I think we are likely to see the the the full Senate voting\nA voting on this nomination at the end of this week\nRight this this whole uh the requests for this investigation it seems somewhat predicated upon the belief that you're you're calling from across the aisle politically as the minority party in the Senate Judiciary committee that they're acting in good faith\nDo you believe that they are I Know that you had harsh words and correct where it's not really harsh but you know honest criticism about how everything was handled you you made that very clear during the uh the committee hearings and when judge Kavanaugh an doctor for both appear do you think that they're acting in good faith going forward\nI think Senate Democrats have demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that they're acting and bad face a within ... minutes of judge Kavanaugh's nomination being announced\nA ... many of them made explicit that they would do anything and everything necessary to try to defeat this nomination uh we saw\nDuring the hearing a couple of weeks ago we saw the protests ah that that it's been publicly reported were were actively coordinating with Democratic senators to have protests to stand up and scream and disrupt the hearing the first day we had Seventy people arrested\nOr to the best of my knowledge that's never happened in a Supreme Court nomination hearing in it and it shows just how it screened just how radical\nSenate Democrats are on this and and most strikingly if you look at Dr Ford's allegation we know that the ... democratic ranking member Senate centered Dianne Feinstein had these allegations in writing\nOn July Thirteen months ago and she did absolutely nothing with them she didn't order for them to the FBI she didn't refer them to the full committee she didn't ask for them to be investigated when judge Kavanaugh met with her privately in her office she did that scored a bounce them\nWhen we had three days of public hearings with judge Kavanaugh she didn't ask for a word about it when we headache confidential hearing this explicitly designed to consider sensitive matters she didn't ask to worry about it we also know\nThat Dr Ford testify that she made very explicit she wanted to remain confidential in the the only people that had her letter she told the committee\nFor herself her lawyers Senator Feinstein and and congresswoman ... that means that when ... when the letter was leaked it could only have come from one of the Democratic members of Congress either\nCongresswoman issue or her staff or Senator Feinstein her staff or somebody they gave it\nThat really shows a level of cynicism\nThat that that that one of the people who has been badly mistreated in this process is Dr Ford when when\nWhen democratic members of the Congress ... out at her put her name or involuntarily and the public arena\n... that that that that really demonstrated that they were willing to use and even abused her because they think that furthers their political interests and and and that that really cynical and unfortunately\nYes it do you think it did it to this point and and and to the attention on on on judge Kavanaugh because now everyone's focusing on how much alcohol he's consuming it seems as though the goal posts are shifting\nDo you think that the media is being hypocritical and focusing on path and I was drinking while ignoring your challenger and your race his previous report a DUI and the witness the witness testimony or to witness report in the police report that described his attempt to flee the scene and how they wouldn't have had to stop and I mean if what happened I did when he was\nA sixteen Seventeen is germane to present Iraq wouldn't wouldn't your challengers from his mid twenties be also with regards to your race\nWell there's there's no doubt there's media double standard and and and when it comes to judge Kavanaugh always seeing the media circling and trying to do everything they can to discredit him to try to tear him down um you know I remember a ... you know we see the media going on and on about how shocked shocked they are\nUh that that kids in high school kids in college or drinking beer or ... or or the\nIntense focus on on judge Kavanaugh's high school yearbook ah with with with with media reporters pretending that that apparently\nA Seventeen year old don't say stupid things and there you can actually judge Kavanaugh was quite candid about yeah but he was a teenager he said some stupid things and as your book but but but the sort of democratic obsession with that\nI I think really demonstrated they're just going to do it everything they can to try to smear him a with respect to my opponent in in in the Senate race we've seen from day one and all in an effort from the media or to to\nA pop him up to protect him to avoid any substance to avoid any mention of his voting record and and and simply to ah to to to ... every two or three days we said glowing profiles\nOr in the press which is why day that he is the number one democratic fundraiser in the country right or wrong and they don't talk about his record\nOr saying for example he he's open to abolishing ice they don't talk about\nHis being the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who is committed already to voting to impeach President Trump that they don't talk about how he bragged about is F rating from the n._r._a. or you know instead of the press likes to their favorite agitated for them\nIs Kennedy and and and they just shower him in ... it's all puppies and rainbows it's all\nHuffy uh\nIt's all huffy a glowing\nPieces that ignore the substance but the thing is I think the voters of taxes are much more interested in substance but the than the media's love affair\nNo one you mentioned his fundraising to he was just slide by the FCC for accepting what they said were excessive and and permissible\nContribution so that's a another hurdle in addition to the police report about the DUI in ... that they're going to have to handle I Know you're you're short on time senator I just have one last question for you we all watched the video where you and your your wife or a ... recently in a restaurant and protesters were very angry at your support for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd ... I think it's sad that this is where we've come to in terms of political discourse in the United states where you at any point concern for your safety at all when all of this was when all of that happened\nWell short it it was an ugly scene um my wife and I were going out to dinner the two of us are where you're going to have a date night which is you know it it it's tough to go and have a date night and get many think but it was about nine o'clock at night it was the end up at a busy day and we figured art ... looked at some time that two of us\nAnd and unfortunately we were hosted by by a group of of left wing protesters who surrounded us in the restaurants around or to set the table\nOr who were yelling and screaming and in our faces and and they disrupted the entire restaurant they made it really impossible for people to to enjoy their their dinners a and so ultimately we had no choice but just get up and leave because we weren't going to disrupt all the other diners in the restaurant and if we said there it was clear they were just going to stand screening\nUh for as long as they could\nUm you know I it is unfortunate Dana that there's so much anger so much hatred such a lack of civility\nOr we can disagree disagreement is is is is perfectly fine and healthy or the first amendment a constitution protect their right to speak and you're right to speak in my right to speak but but we can disagree in a way that that that that actually respect each other's humanity\nThat that that that that demonstrate some level of decency and and civility and and it is unfortunate that we're seeing the extreme left do this more and more\nUm and and for those of us\nWere conservatives those of us who who who believe in individual liberty I I I think it's important for us not to respond and con don't respond with that same anger that same hatred instead\nWe should be happy warriors and and and and work you know ... ... we're just sending the troops we're defending human liberty we're defending the constitution of the bill of rights and I think the contrast\nBetween us is happy warriors and the angry laugh a it is really stark and and and and and I think it's evidence to ... to reasonable sir\nI I'm so happy that you said that as well and I and I wish that ah some of your colleagues on the Democrat side of the island would join you and saying that because I think those are the only people that are those particular groups of individuals are going to listen to Senator Ted Cruz we appreciate your time today\nI Will be watching as things unfold this week uh prayers for your safety and your wife safety as well thank you so much for joining us\nWell data thank you very much and let me urge your listeners to come to our website it's Ted Cruz dot org Ted Cruz died or\n[noise] paying jak youngster host of the greatest city show ever wonder why some cities just seem to flourish turns out it's because they're great at bringing people together mentoring the next generation and investing in ideas that impact\nAnd it's happening in Tucson joined me every Saturday on the greatest city show from three to four pm on ten thirty cave you either voice here about the people an idea is shaping juice on future [noise] a\nChallenger dark forty four service hey I'm Jim ... why torture erode to shock on the Web at treating your wife dot com\n[noise]\nThis was our firm tone ...\nTrucks actually wants to help you out to conduct a comprehensive investigations\nInto the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president's resisting democratic complaints that he's micromanaging the process I think the FBI I should do what they have to do to get to the answer including talking to a cabin on himself I think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them and says it's also find if the bureau interviews all three of Kavanaugh's accuser ...\nThe president says the only thing he's insisting on your speed because a probe that drags on is unfair to Kavanaugh do you use a an expression often used by me we don't want to go on a witch hunt doing soccer ...

to have you on I Wish I could talk to you about something more fun but you know what if we're talking about something as important that's even more important than just having fun so let's get into it there is so much going on in our country we need wisdom what are we to make of the current situation what are you what do you have to say\nWell apart from being aghast\nAnd appalled and horrified Eric I Can't say that I'm particularly surprised um\nIf you take a step back from the immediacy of the Kavanaugh debacle\nUh at the hands of the Democrats if you try to look at this from a thirty thousand foot vantage point it all makes complete sense because the Democrats look\nThat the left has been at war with the constitution the country free market economics individual liberty\nFrom essentially vary from the beginning of the republic but certainly over the last century or so the progressive movement has sought to in the words of President Obama fundamentally transform the nation and what a bomb that meant by that is what the ... the left means by that more broadly which is\nChange the United states away from the foundational principles that made it great individual liberty economic freedom strong national security rule of law move the country away from those pillars and toured a collective state ... state socialist economics\nA command and control from Washington and so on\nThey have been on a war to affected that change for decades now\nSo they have they have met with resistance by the American people who are essentially a center right people throughout this entire war that they've been waging\nSo because they haven't been able to achieve a lot of those goals by the ballot box because the American people see it for what it is and rejected they have used the courts\nParticularly the Supreme Court but the court said all level to impose their ideas and their agenda because they couldn't do it legislatively so when you take a step back and you look at the confirmation fights over Clarence Thomas for example Robert Bork were they were successful and torpedo and\nAnd why why do you have to raise the things that I Know of a different\nTack to show before we continue our conversation with Monica Crowley and an hour to we've got John from Iraq I I just want to say that you know or the fight over judge camera Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court or probably we hope be over by this time next week that would be nice but\nThe battle against those who restrict your religious freedom unfortunately goes on and on and on and nobody is in the front

I was very sympathetic to what she was saying and I thought this sweet woman she seems so fragile and so broken and she's trying to get this information out\nAnd when it was all over the holes in this began to to come to me I wasn't thinking of it while she was on the stand while she's giving this testimony but I began to think about\nAll of the strange stuff like she doesn't know how she got there she doesn't know how she got home nobody knows what House it was and then there's not a single person who was there who can remember it which doesn't make any sense because I remember high school parties and then you just remember stuff like that nobody remembers it in fact all of them are clear\nThat they don't remember it and then to me the weirdest thing was\nHer she had this little girl voice like a whole demeanor seemed very very fragile\nAnd I thought how can someone I mean of course a sane person says okay I got to be sympathetic this person has gone through something but then\nYou think how can anybody believe her when there is nothing forthcoming beyond this testimony it's just somebody says some stuff and we say isn't that sad we have to believe her of course we don't have to believe or we need evidence\nWell that's right and that's called due process that's coal rule of law that the Democrats in their wider war for the future of the country have gets thrown out these damn drops of our constitutional or legal in judicial system\nWithout a care because of course there are ideological motives and goals trumps everything else including the constitution and including will of law\nSuits and yet she may or may not have been through something traumatic at some point I mean I feel for anybody who has gone through term I think most of us over the course of our life experiences of trauma in one way or or the other\nSo I I feel for anybody's pain but the idea that she can't put the pieces of the puzzle together and it coherent way that can be corroborated ought to a rule that day here now the FBI is talking to people and so on and we shall see\nBut I found it remarkable that the Democrats and and I've got a piece coming tomorrow column in the hill talking exactly that that the Democrats like camel Harris Cory Booker ... with their performance anger\nA world without a shred of evidence but they were engaged in indulging in in performance anger meanwhile judge Kavanaugh who I Believe has been unjustly accused of my goodness\nYou're working an anti intoxicating women said that they could be gang raped okay I mean he came out with an incredibly righteous anger being unjustly accused and they mocked him for it and then they let that not that to say he did not have judicial temperament to sit on the Supreme\nCourt isn't that whole area kitty ...\nRight well listen I what I find the funniest at speaking as a as a as a white man of a certain age whenever somebody talks about white male anger\nI get angry because I think to myself this is not white male anger my wife who is not a male and my many friends who are women who are black women Candace Owen has been public this is about right and wrong ... so when people talk about white male anger\nThey prove that they\nTalk about white male anger may prove that they cannot see past their bias ease with regard to sex or color they are obsessed with race they're obsessed with sex most normal Americans are not most Americans don't do that if you have a son\nA brother a father a grandfather and uncle you think\nAbout those people at but these women are are are so unhinged and the men that that are adopting this point of view they cannot see pastors so it's never about right or wrong it's ever about facts are lies it's always about what's the color of your skin are you a man or woman and and I just have to say when you when you have to go there so to speak\nYou've already lost I mean when these people have to do that\nI think to myself that I I really do believe most Americans see through this that's messed my face\nYeah and they get to my earlier point about how they they really do have to destroy cabinet block in the way they tried with Clarence Thomas and so on because they cannot achieve their goals at the ballot box this country is still a center right\nThe leftist ideas of socialism collective isn't state and some are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the American people so they relied on the court to slam into place their agenda\nOn and in in what you're talking about identity politics\nThey got to slice and dice the American public by race gender ethnicity and so on because that's the only way they even have a chance to win it through the courts and it's by dividing and conquering us\nThat's the only way that they have any hope show that's what they continue to do is fundamentally\nAnti American you know our slogan on every penny ... soon them out of many one right well they sure of that and to reverse out of one many right because that's the only only hope that they have to get their agenda to change the country\nIt's it's I mean I have to say that uh it was very very heartening or to see someone who I don't think of as particularly a conservative Lindsey Graham ah finally say I've had enough I think that\nThere are people like that who don't fear speaking emotionally there there are many who who do and I I think that they have been so careful that they've allowed this to happen they allow people like Dianne Feinstein and Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and others\nTo take advantage of their graciousness you know 'cause they act like well the senators a club and we have to you know when you realize that\nSome of the people in that room they don't really believe in anything you just said it before you referring to Ted Kennedy I mean\nThe idea Ted Kennedy was a swine he was a swine Nash man threw out his life often extremely drunk touching women having all kinds of I mean just such a mess he\nWas a Senate tore for decades and he was lying eyes by the left when he passed and I think to myself\nThis is the dishes vintage double standard and I and let's talk about it but people forget people forget that you have people like that that we're we're lying eyes by the leftist chancellor yeah women in\nMy column tomorrow in the hills talks exactly about the Kennedy example in particular\nBut I remember it guys like Kennedy and Bill Clinton because they were on this so called right side of the issues including most importantly the abortion issue they were protected and on top of that and the the extra layer of protection of the press\nSo that's something that Brett Kavanaugh does not have he has on the quote unquote wrong side of the issues most importantly abortion and she does not have

I mean maybe the principle here is that no matter what you do they will complain so finally\nThe GOP says okay we'll have FBI inquiry now they're complaining about that it is at at some point it's kind of like a parent where the kid keeps putting excuses about I Can't go to bed now because I got what about this what about the at some point that you know what you better go to bed or you're going to get it\nI kind of feel like the G O P needs to be like no matter what you do the other side snipes and snipes and winds and now what about this and what about the any think wow they really don't care about anything except winning I mean it's kind of obvious\n[noise] well yeah and it you know I mean no never does anything big like this without having everything pre scripted in advance so I Would not be at all surprised if over the course of this week when the FBI\nIs doing their investigation they'll last June that more accusers more accusations demand for further investigation and more delay\nIn ... they are at war I mean they're just playing three dimensional chess it as like oh gentleman's rules from the Eighteen eighty right now we're playing on two different playing field here\nThe other side is waging war and I just think well if we get the mess it will will show or good will will demonstrate that right it\nDoesn't work that way and so on our side get it\nI think like the Ted Cruz is that the world I think even Lindsey Graham is now has awoken to this\nLike Jeff Flake who are completely\nConsumed with their hatred of Donald Trump\nAre allowing to all of this to get in the way he was on sixty minutes last night with a Democrat Chris Coons oh we've forged this bipartisan compromise\nTo allow the FBI to look at this for a week do you think the last ... think Coons do you think Feinstein and and the far left that they look at this as oh this was so great a bipartisan compromise this is just yet another to lay tired they want to push this past November and vote\nTo see if they'll have more leverage to stop this seat from ever being filled until the twenty twenty election right\nI mean that that's obvious in it that's the question is do people on the geo piece I Know is there anybody there who gets it I Wonder uh\nWhat the president's role has been if he's had a role behind the scenes or if he feels he has to be very very careful but I I the president has always gotten this stuff he somebody who is you know kind of a warrior at heart sometimes to a fault but I really do think that Americans\nWho are inclined toward traditional values toward a\nUm toward voting a more conservative leader I think a lot of them the reason they voted for Trump and the reason they're probably upset with the Senate now is because of this and they think\nWhat is wrong with these people are playing Patty cake with the devil Dianne Feinstein is so cynical her legacy will be how she cynically played this this is at the end of her career is so ugly it's so negatively political it's depressing\nYou know over the weekend irregardless watching MSNBC and little did CNN a little bit the bill Maher show on HBO little bit and I literally had to turn it off because I felt literal nauseous because these people are so cruel\nAnd they're still vicious and they're so ruthless and the top logical liars\nNot that there's anything wrong with that because we know we know that we're not supposed to judge\n... the ease with which they will mock and disregard and tear apart a good and decent man like Brett Kavanaugh over politics over their war for the future of the country the viciousness and cruelty that I saw I literally had to turn it off and get away from that\nBecause I felt it on his spiritual level and you live talked about this we've talked about our our beliefs and and our faith then Jesus and everything I look at these battles not just on there the sort of natural level and the political level and so on", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "02"}
