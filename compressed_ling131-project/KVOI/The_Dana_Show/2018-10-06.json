she's quoting scripture let every person being objection to the governing authority for there's no authority now you can interpreted interpreted different ways people have a right to dissent but I Do detect in what is happening right now a clear\n\nI put this is the stepping over the line that\nPreviously we we we hadn't been willing to step over and that has to go to descend to a level\nOf such naked politicking that you don't really care about the other guy right and we're supposed to love our enemies which which means that you you can still fight someone but you fight them the way you want someone to fight you fairly by the rules using the facts or whatever and so I guess for me when I say there's two things you can do you can\nAnd so I guess for me what I say there's two things you can do you can pray and by the way folks if you're any kind of a Christian or person of faith\nYou you're obligated to pray for your country it's just not like extra credit it's please folks pray for this

came here because there was hoping opportunity and they thought maybe some day or they get a family here and they could have opportunities that they could never have where they came from and\nUh I'm

his program on TV and is wrapping up an entire year on the air going out to be a walk on the program and congratulations\nThank\nYou Eric I'll tell you it's been a great year uh we've got a lot of wonderful things I think the head of the show is just really getting it's a it's his feet on the ground I mean a year is not a real on time or media show but uh from the very beginning we came out of the blocks very strong our very first guest was the president\nThat in a bad way to start no and within the first few weeks we've had Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton a Chuck Negron from three dog night not a whole host of people that gave our show at great launch\nYou you always get great a musical gas I have to say that's one of the things I've always loved by your show when you had your show on Fox you had all kinds of great folks on there\nUm I have to ask you a couple of questions first of all did you know\nThat uh my radio program the one that Iran right now the TBN is building us a a a studio here in New York City and they are going to televise\nA it I think every weekend following your show you're you're going to give me the lead and I've been looking for my whole life I just know pressure but I think that that's going to happen\nSo I just wanted to let you know\nIf you want to know what comes on after your show now you know mad hasn't given to me that in writing and he can be slippery I'm just warning you but I'm telling you I'm so excited that I'm going to be on at some point maybe it's not immediately following your show but also I got to say I am going to be literally on your show talking about my new book\nDonald drain the swamp has your staff warn you about that\nThey have and I try to get a guest host to be there\nThat but uh you would take it so it looks like I'm not be there I'll be I'll be happy to to to guest host because I've interviewed myself in the past and it's easy it's easy I Know just what to ask\n'em and I know what to steer clear of you know all the sensitive stuff that I don't want to talk about but yeah no well obviously I've got this this fun book it's called Donald drain the swamp so I Will be a I'll be on your program talking about that but the the reason really I go in that direction as I Want to talk about what's going on in America right now\nI watch you uh you know in all kinds of Venus and I follow your Twitter feed and you seem to be coming out where I'm coming out this is a dark day for America what we have done to this judge but so many people seem really unrepentant they seem\nAh as though anything they can do to attack this president or or take down his his nominees it's a scorched earth policy where do you see us going from here\n[noise] well if we don't bring Susannah them back to the system um I'm not sure that aren't great Republican survive long term and and for me Eric I Believe that what this comes down to is whether or not people who lose an election will accept the results\nWhat we're seeing is the outgrowth of people who never accepted the results of the twenty sixteen presidential election and they have spent the last almost two years trying to de legitimize the election and\nThe person who won and every decision mix whether it was a decision involving protecting our borders where there was a decision involving a that negotiations with North Korea getting out of the deal of Iran every single thing this president does\nIts attacked whether legally or politically by those who refused to accept that he is the president of the United states and that is a dangerous thing I didn't like it when President Obama was elected didn't vote for him either time\nUm [noise] but I never ever\nThought that the way to deal with his presidency was to try to pretend that he didn't win the election and to quote him he said elections have consequences while it appears that two people on the left the consequences of the lecture and they don't like is to throw a tantrum\nAct Petra in Lowell a like a five year old a hold your breath to your face turns blue and scream and throw things across the room and break every window in the house\nIsn't that isn't that what George Washington did\nA it really is kind of funny actually because when you say that it it it makes a I I think most people realize that something has happened in the country it's it's funny because I remember even the election of two thousand and we have the hanging chads and that bizarre period no one had ever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "06"}
