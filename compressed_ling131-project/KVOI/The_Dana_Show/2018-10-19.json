like you're hurting me I'm just stop back away\nAnd someone get the police um and just really just kept\nPulling tighter um and saying things like Adam only you can make this stuff you know I'll stop hurting your you know basically insinuating that he would stop hurting me if he would talk to him rather than answers questions\nAnd so it was very very alarming I'm just a you know I felt unsafe for myself obviously but then also a former candidate front step\nOn to no one could kind of holding back finally when um the security and and see marshals on site got there they were able to say you know he kind of backed off that the only way he backed off was them and um you know I kind of the book it's not believe this this just happened um I mean everyone has\nSeen some of the stuff on the news they just don't\nUm actually no it can happen until you're there with your are behind you and you can get free 'em over someone that is trying to scream question that a candidate because you know that's what his employers paying them to do 'em and\nYou know what I had no idea where he was at the time it was only then after people looked him up and said this guy is interested in a bunch of times and it's just I cannot fathom\nA an organization like American bridge keeping this guy in their payroll even just with one arrest a few months ago mhm um yeah and then so I see I Believe they fired him now\nUm but but my question is why why was he working for them and you know this is what they were paying them to do and you know it's it's kind of it's upsetting because most of us out\nOn campaigns are working for people we believe in and we're trying to run campaigns focus on a message and the other's rhetoric that heats up now and then but to actually be you know I I consider myself kind of tough but to actually be scared and really really shaken the rest of the night afterwards um and you know kind of scared to go by myself\nI'm is just something that I've never experienced in in politics before and you know I think when we see\nPeople you know I think like attorney general Eric Holder was here campaigning with our opponent just a few weeks ago and he's saying you know kick them when they're down and you hear 'cause like ... saying you know don't be civil and these are things that encourages this kind of stuff\nAnd there's no place for it\nAnd no and there there isn't\nAnd he was and and as I understand it he was arrested for battery\nAnd you're at or you have ... and you're going to press charges\nCould yeah um and so I was it's been kind of a whirlwind of the day just trying to get my bearings back and so you know my my my focus is you know we get back to work I Want to get this campaign moving and just when\nI'm so that that process um you know we will be a court date and all of that um and so we will um yeah no I when I ... I don't want anyone I don't want to happen to anyone again\nWhy could yeah exactly and because he has a history you mentioned that this has happened before this happened several times with him before\nHe he was taken to the ground by police and he was arrested because of his uh behavior towards candidate Ed Gillespie this was back during the Republican gubernatorial race in Virginia\nAnd then he assaulted Heather swift the press secretary for interior secretary Ryan Zinke ... who was they were just leaving a ... a meeting and he apparently shoved her and was just trying to physically move her out of the way to get it ... and she was\nShe couldn't find him off a show he was arrested again after that and American bridge kept him on this entire time which suggests to me a Christian that they kept him on because of his behavior because they wanted intimidation\nRight I mean that's the only thing that I can assume I mean I I Know just from um opposition research groups that I've worked with the with any kind of political organization\nThat's all you got people so they have a history of violence most likely they're not going to be hired 'em but especially when they're on your payroll and arrested for something like that you know\nEveryone that I Know and I've ever worked with and would have fire that person to me it would never hire them back so obviously he had a green light to act like this and um you know be as aggressive as possible\nScare people and um make a scene I mean that that's that's what what they wanted them to do right\nExactly yeah and and I mean what he's doing kind of\nReally undermines with a purpose of a trap for is because trackers I mean they get more the less if they're seen if people think that they're not being recorded they're more apt to get something from that particular exchange or\nOr event so he's kind of defeating the purpose of of his entire job by being so aggressive and and and inserting himself into into these scenarios the way that he's doing\nYeah ... exactly I mean he kept when he was talking with the police after he kept saying this is going to pay to do is and I'm thinking like you have to like physically harmed people I don't understand how that part of your your job and you know it was very clear to them you know they said\nHe was way over aggressive and the point of of harm yet and and you know if you're trying to get information on a for both campaigns do it there's a respectful way to do it there's a safe way to do it and then raise crosses want on\nYeah absolutely well I'm Glad that you're okay I saw the photos of the bruising though because he apparently had a nice good grip and you can see is where his hands were for crying out loud to hit a nice good grip on you but I'm Glad that you're okay uh and hopefully the guy's not gonna\n... they want to have American bridge and uh the source organizations hiring the sky anymore I mean there's they gotta they gotta stop this nonsense\nBut we're very glad that you that you're okay uh and the end you last ... last quick question for you this is it does this make you rethink how you approach campaigning when you're out in public because of what happened here\nWell of course I mean you know it I I had just\nWell of course I mean you know it\nI I hate to say that it does 'cause you don't want to just what you're doing but um I mean like I said I was concerned like I said it I was\nConcerned that my candidate safety and so now when we campaign that's going to have to be one of those I mean we're always thinking of it but now it's even more I go through it and I are we even able to have them in one specific spot you need to get more security um\nAnd it really is unfortunate because the best part of this that\nYou know that's perfect candidate for the voters is to have them there one on one you know shaking hands are getting to know that people don't want to elect the next governor or their state\nAnd when you have to worry about someone you know being sent in from the far left organization that's gonna you know as people around and cuts or the goal harm it's going to put a damper on on the whole that so yeah it's definitely another thing that we have to think about um you know even more so on a granular level than we were before\nI went with everyone on edge to I mean yeah I'm I really I have a terrific team everyone's been great they are um everyone is that working hard and not letting the shake 'em but\nYou know everyone's human so when you're in the vein you're going to be looking around a little bit more making sure that there's no one storm and then they're trying to your hours behind your back and keep it from their own free\nYeah absolutely well we're glad you're alright ...

Donald drain the swamp and I I have to say I'm happy to say that\nYesterday Dennis ... me on and I talked to him about it he's very excited about the book or in this morning Hugh Hewitt had me on and he's excited about the book and I love those guys are excited book it must be a great book so I'm going to get copies ... and um yeah you should read it but but actually what really makes me happy\nIs that I went and the only way you can see how a book is doing realistically like moment to moment\nIs to check on Amazon is a rank if you get on a product descriptions it says it gives you the book rank you know ... and uh obviously you want to get to number one the number one bestseller in all of the universe\nIs now here's here's the thing right now what's the number one book my book was oh I don't know a thousand or something like that and then as I got on Hugh Hewitt and whatever to it it went to like three hundred something which is decent right but it's still not in the top one hundred\nWell this morning are just now it jumped to one Seventy so we're we're breathing down the neck of the top one hundred right what's the number one book in the country Steven cold there has written a bitter anti Trump\nFake children's book now it's a real thick children's book in the sense that you would never give it to a kid it looks like a kids' book but it's not appropriate for children because it's just kind of mean and weird\nBut my book of course is uh even though it's a huge book for adults like old bears book gets really also a children's book genuinely you can give it to kids and people are giving his kids and kids like it and they specially liked to say George Soros\nBut what drives me crazy is that called bear is on every night right being mean it's one thing not to like the president but he's pretty vicious if I had a TV show like his I Would never be that vicious about Hillary Obama or whatever it's one thing to correct jokes I mean Johnny Carson always cracked jokes or that the president but\nThere's a meanness to it that bothers me\nAnd so of course now he's ... he and his writers and put out this book and it's literally number one\nIn the country and so I kind of like to send a message or to the to the country into into Mr cold beer or by having my book uh at some point over take his book yeah so that means his book will have to drop from number one\nAnd a or my book could just go to number one but you know there's so many people in this country who don't hate the president and I kind of think like hey I'm if you don't have the president\nOr maybe this book is for you and I actually think that this was a good book to give to people who don't like the president because it's it's warm hearted it's not mean it's not like ha ha but whatever I just just had to say that I was so glad that Hugh Hewitt loved it I'm Dennis Prager loved it [noise]\nUm I was supposed to be I'm Shannon Bream last night and I think\nI said that on

Thursday in our too we do a throwback\nThursday so we always want to make sure that in our one we have something to get literally fresh and wonderful and I'm happy to report that on the line with me is our friend Sebastian Gorka Sebastian welcome to the program\n\nThanks for having me back out right\nWell I Love talking to you about anything anytime but you've got a new book out of course I've got a new book out but enough about me what do you think about my new book just getting a year a new book in which\nI I Wish I Wish I thought about it but\nAs long as somebody thought of it now you you um you have a new book out called why we fight or defeating America's enemies with no apologies\nThe title of your book\nObviously makes most of us think of this president there's something about this president there that he's a fighter and sometimes I think people even people like me bristle a little bit we you know because we think sometimes there is a time\nTo apologize and so and so forth but he seems to have this fighter spirit in him that's unlike anything we've really seen in modern times I Can't think of any president even approaches and even my favorite president Ronald Reagan he didn't have this kind of\nA ... side Trump has that you have that in the book titled why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies obviously\nYou capture that what is it about this time that made you write a book with this title with this theme and what makes this president have this attitude why do you think we need this right now Sebastian\nI think it's very simple I think this is the reason that most American elected in ... president it's because all of the book on ... on the rise\nBusiness as or politics do does not represent the will of the people and doesn't fix the problems that infects drinks affected by the exactly the same thing happened with a British cousins were ...\nThey saw the European Union fundamentally representing instruct the British people sort of said enough is enough start when the thing\nI I think the fact that I traveled with the president's Youngstown, Ohio that Neal valley a court Democrat area and we went for a rally stayed there was packed I met with hundreds of people before the president made his speech\nAnd it was electric because these were manual laborers from the ballot right all of the working class Americans you know what the weather's the Democrats the parents or grandparents and ordered billionaire from Manhattan came on stage with his youthful why what happened\nThe whole building resonate for ... minutes Charles usa usa\nDrain the swamp this into Texas\nThis is a little town right Ohio I think I think that tells you you know people want to have things fixed\nThey look at the low in Washington they look they look at senator or congressman who built Capitol Hill for for you all for two years\nYep which would horrify founding fathers\nUnless we change a winner this kind of\nPauses to disrupt the truth all proper\nWell you're very right it's funny when you when you see him appear that way and you have all these working class people clamoring uh to see him to cheer for him it reminds me of Churchill in World War two and I think that we're kind of in a battle even though some people are not willing to acknowledge it\nWith forces that in their own way or as pernicious\nPernicious as the forces of fascism in Europe they they threatened\nTo destroy everything we hold dear these are existential threats to self government to liberty to all of the things that we have built over centuries in the west and I think that\nThe you know the common man in America gets it he sees it in in all kinds of ways and so that people have in fact been looking for a hero heroes are never perfect they have feat of clay\nBut they have an ability to rally people when do you think of Churchill trickle with is far from the common man\nAs anybody I mean he grew up in blend them\nPalace for goodness sake and yet\nSomehow with an American mother with an American ... yeah well there you go that gets them out of it also but it is so fascinating because when you mentioned this billionaire showing up with his beautiful wife what is it that resonates and it's I think the idea\nThat people say look he's fighting for me somehow I Know he's fighting for me that's a big deal in this day and age when you have people like\nYou know nobody really believed that that Mitt Romney are Jeb Bush had anything approaching that and and God Forbid a ambassador Huntsman and these are not the kind of people who are going to resonate with rust belt a worker so it is it's it's a fascinating phenomenon you're quite right\nSo it is it's it's a fascinating phenomenon you're quite right\nOr an editor for all the justice and in many cases it is a\nSimple this lettuce and ... the assault to view lurking where people are not because they actually do it this isn't just rhetoric on this promise\nNever produce the person says I'm going to crush arts at school or do you come across as I said the economy stinks everybody's you know like like a dollar but tied down by the litter fusion\nRegulation value or completely change\nThat what happened to the American economy and the most important goal when it comes to personal moral fiber you look at what he did for justice capital\nIn the White House where he drew says stood up to the whole world and that this man has been wrong and he is innocent so it's it's not just the impression ... I think it's a truly frightening as you kind of fake that\nIt it it is funny because I I think again that we need that more than ever there's there's just no question I think that he had run for president in Nineteen eighty it wouldn't have worked but the fact of the matter is today we are in such bad straits I mean it's an amazing thing to think that\nGreat Britain voted they voted to leave
