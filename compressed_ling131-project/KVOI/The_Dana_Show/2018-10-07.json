about your background you or marine my when did you join would you do\nYes I joined the marine corps you ask them for I was not happy with my life where it was at that point in time and I always joke around that Eighteen year old bread or to kick the you know what out of twenty two year old bread\nThe shock and awe campaign was going on and I was just absolutely intrigued by it and I decided to join\nWell that makes sense what did you have a great honor what\nShut artillery okay the bastard child of the of the bastard child yes [laughter] you have a hearing loss as a result\nYes I was attached you want to live and Charlie battery on campaigns and California we were responsible for the final field tests of the new triple seven house where they came out so as a boot PFC I was able to shoot over four thousand rounds downrange\nWhere else in one of their career area could somebody at the PFC level of experience do something like that the military it's amazing what you can do\nExactly we always joked around that were playing GI Joe out in the desert [laughter]\nYeah I could tell you some desert stories out there but it will be ... will do that later okay what got you interested in mortgages\nWho that's a long story I'll Try to sum it up as quickly as possible I purchased my home using a my BA homeland benefit back two thousand twelve\nAnd we went to refinance my home I say we me and my wife went to refinance my home because we knew we wanted to purchase again using our VA homeless benefit and every lender I talked to\nHad no idea how to handle it how how to answer the question I ended up settling on the fact that I could not have multiple VA home loans I cannot reuse it by some right now I'm In a Fifteen year conventional fix Marge ... pm I\nWhich drives me insane when in fact the lender just didn't know what they were doing so that kinda propelled me down the road of becoming a VA home on specials\nAnd you are that now so let's talk about VA loans\nEverybody who serve generally speaking is entitled to a VA alone at some point or rather the biggest thing I've noticed we've agreed bizarre conversations\nMost veterans don't know what their rights are mostly veterans don't know what they have\n... who's a veteran out there we just talked to said the allows my about if you buy a house how to talk to a real answer when you're considering a VA loan watch or some kind of loan what are the kinds of things you need to do one or the alert points of the things we need to be aware that we don't know\nI understand what you're saying the number one question at me as a veteran what ask a lender would be am I eligible\nBecause you'd be surprised at the amount of lenders that cannot tell you give you the straight answer\nBecause it's not as easy as are you a veteran oh therefore you are entitled to the VA hormone it's not that simple especially here in West Michigan where we're surrounded by reserves centers so the reservists need to meet a specific\nYear end points\nIf we do not have those years and point statements how can we determine if you're eligible so that that would be the first question that I Would ask as a matter of ... ... am I eligible can you tell me if I'm eligible and\nIf they say yes I can tell you if you are there is a document it is the most important document dealing with the VA home loan that are highly advise you and suggest that you obtain this document it's your eligibility certificate your CEO he\nThis is the document that will allow you as a veteran to go to any lender and say hey I'm eligible for the VA home mom who gives it to be a now there's three ways in which you can obtain a CEO of ...\nThe first way is through the ... benefits Web portal which if you are not on that actively I highly suggest you at least check it out it's a fantastic Web portal\nGets you there you can get it through a lender me as a lender I can pull it for you it takes me thirty seconds and that's no joke I type a three fingers type a little slower [laughter] but I can pull of Oregon thirty seconds or you can go through archives dot Gov\nOkay she'll get it it's not a problem all you need to do is no you needed\nCorrect in the reason why I'm emphasizing this is because there's so many lenders out there that will blame these long drawn out process as to obtain this eligibility document and if they cannot get it for you they obviously do not know how to do reveal more\nSo that's a good indication to go somewhere else this girl going to get on the front lines of freedom I seem to be a mortgage with red students to read tell us the name of the company you work with\nI work with the veterans home front at benchmark mortgage\nOkay so now I Know I'm eligible because I asked her I got by certificate what else do I need to know about a VA alone as a veteran assuming that I'm eligible for\nOkay there are many many many benefits to the VA home loan the most important one is that you've earned it\nThis is the best financing to on the planet you ever earned it do not let anyone tell you otherwise in Egypt you otherwise the benefits that are included in the VA home loan include no P. M. I. you pay no mortgage insurance on a monthly basis that saves you over a hundred dollars every month\nThere's lenient credit underwriting so if you had a prior VA foreclosure or if you've had a foreclosure filed bankruptcy or your credit is not to the standard that you think it should be you'd be shocked at what's allowed with the VA home loan\nYou can have multiple VA home loans at a time and there are many many many more so please do\nMonths at a time and there are many many many more so we used to do all of us veterans service and do not listened to them is that are out there\nWe don't have a lot of time left but there are some miss out there why don't you tell us what some of them are\nThe miss that are out there that I come across on a daily basis are zero down equals week buyer because we have earned the right to do with zero downpayment loan they automatically assume that veterans are we buyers credit\nUnderwriting takes longer\nThe VA home loans take longer to close my personal favorite the seller has to pay for the veterans fees the other mass is you can only have one be alone at a time or one in your lifetime and the most prevalent with the real estate community is UVA appraisals are\nTougher so what are you just talked about folks are not true but too many people think they are true read were a lot of time but\nOne year and have to have you back talk to listeners now about how they can contact you if they have questions who what you're saying applies across the United states ... ... people contact you if they want more information\nJust absolutely you can find my information on my Web site at W.

Seventy two to buffalo to fifty five time of possession thirty seven minutes to twenty two\nFirst dials twenty five to buffalo fourteen and even the army had one turnover they could still overcome that so\nYou know again when you look at those kinds of stuff those are winning stats when you see that army ran the ball for two hundred and eighty one year to remember with air force I say that you want to have it closer to three hundred\nAnd but they held buffalo to Russian for all the one hundred and three are so they're planning winning football the the sensors play well they're controlling the clock beginning the running game going and getting some big plays in there and surprisingly this year uh Kelvin Hopkins has shown that he's a better passer\nThan the previous quarter back and go to mark and as allowing him to throw a ball now than ever going to be mistaken for running shoe came okay let's not let's not get a\nGet ahead of ourselves but Hopkins completed four out of five passes for a touchdown and Eighteen point two yards per completion saw more in Ninety One yards in total so\nYou know when you look at that that's a game winning football yeah back to their two hundred and eighty one on the ground and now you you see why the officers operating at a highly efficient level and the beach answers really plant good ball as well holding buffalo dollar two hundred and fifty five yard\nTotal yard one fifty to passing on one of three hundred crowd\nAnyway you like it is that's a great game or one of our search county football we want to be it is ...\nThat's right in the army now moved to three and two there are only two losses being against power five teams Duke who's having a good season this year and of course Oklahoma so so army look strong and I tell you as you look at the rest of their schedule\nIt really looks favorable for that I could honestly see them running the table are mainly when I Want to get ahead of ourselves at all but\nIt could honestly see them doing that good as they don't have another power five team on a schedule\nAnd it's all well ... what he's air force\nIt to be maybe a week that\n[laughter] is this is the one we get you and I
