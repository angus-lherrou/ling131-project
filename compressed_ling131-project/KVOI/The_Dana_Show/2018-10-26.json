were more than ... there were more than happy to like jump all over her and a cover it like oh here's it because she had covered um demeaning to stop that NBC\nSo and for people to say she's made the show a toxic environment I have worked with her on Fox special before I for people\nTo say that I'm Sorry but you all are liars everybody at Fox all her staff loved her her staff at Fox loved her these people at NBC that are trying to make this stuff out there jealous mean\nGirls the boys too\nBecause that is not true they're just trying to do whatever they can to pile on that's malicious I daresay I don't know sounds defamatory but that's not true\nThough she created a toxic work environment she's hard to work with no she wasn't\nI I've known her longer than these people and and I don't need to defend her I just hate when people lie because they're piling on I Can't stand that nonsense\nBut\nI'm at Fox and makeup artist loved her I Know all of I still of her producers one of our producers and still good friends with a or her old producer that was at Fox her staff really liked her\nAnd here's something else that you're not going to that you don't see and I'm going to tell you something about the industry conservative politics is very interesting people on ... and conservative politics are more cutthroat and they hate each other privately more southern progressive\nAll of the biggest ridiculous and as I saw from other women petty gossipy women\nStabbing each other in the back I have seen some grown women make fools of themselves in the conservative political sphere\nAnd they do it all back channel I could tell you names maybe one day I Will but some crazy stuff and some of the people who present themselves as the biggest Christian commentators some of them are some of the nastiest gossipy people behind the scenes\nBut then you have some really good women to\nSome really good men and women who are very genuine like Dana Perino I think is one of the most genuine people in the industry\nWhat you see with her is what you get\nShe is encouraging she is in she is very inclusive\nShe looks out for like when you when they bring in\nUm you know like it's a town hall or if you know somebody else has a if they have new people that are coming into the studio who are a little nervous about going on here for the first time she was always so nice to them and made them feel very welcome and I have to say Megan did a lot at Fox to promote women at that network\nAnd she would bring women from different parts of the political sphere onto that network in onto her show\n\nAlways I she had me on her show at least once a week she had other women on her show she made an effort to do that\nThere are other like there are other people you know Dana Perino makes an effort to do that people like Kennedy people there are some really and and for people to say that she somehow causes like a a toxic environment I just don't I've never seen that everybody\nMen and women appreciated her work ethic and they thought she was easy to work with and they appreciated that she valued what everybody brought to the table whether you be a gaffe or or whether you be an associate producer didn't matter\n\nAnd it's very easy to get away from that because I have seen really nasty people you know I just and and and it's it so that I saw that headline and I'm like are you kidding me\nAre you for real\nCalm on so I I don't know I that aggravates me I think that there's I think NBC had it out from the very beginning and you know like one of my friends said they got a problem apparently with women host you know what they did an hurry you know one of the biggest mean girls was Matt Lauer\nMy gosh Matt Lauer Superman girl Superbad mean

today's workforce is noble and active and they want in office designed around the way they weren't [noise] and ... makes it easy very desk standing desk solution help you create an active workspace where employees to stand and move to they're happier\nHelping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nI'll let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizen step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation a tone is civility atone that mutual respect as something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women in law enforcement respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank you\nLike him as a matter of fact country right now the FBI\nJoint terrorism task forces around the nation are fully engaged on his investigation we're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes and until there is a resolution\nThis is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from ATF\nUS postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder\nMight want to thank those partners for their efforts there collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally thank the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working on this together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nInvestigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adverse impact our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days ten suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package which collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAsked the device is located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating it any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nWe continue to revise the American public to remain vigilant as it does remain possible further packages have been or could be mailed\nThese devices should be considered dangerous report any assistance package to law enforcement and it just worth repeating do not touch do not move do not handle any specific suspicious or unknown package leave it to the law enforcement professionals\nWe're also asking the public to call us with any information you may have we've set up a hotline nationwide that hotline is one eight hundred call FBI and we also have a link set up where you can provide information via the Internet at tips dot FBI dot Gov\nWe are actively investigating tips you have already provided please continue to assist us with our efforts a moment of your time to make a great difference towards resolving this investigation thank you\n\nI think most of your up to speed on the events that occurred um outside of the time Warner center at CNN yesterday of what I'd like to do is kind of walk you through the timeline of the events of this morning on granted street\nOr this begins in the very early hours of the morning when a retired NYPD intelligence bureau detective um was awake and watching the news or saw the image\nOf the packaging that has been common to most of these devices are as they've turned up at various locations\nAnd it struck him that that looked very much like a package she had seen on Tuesday I'm In ... he was to screen or for Robert De Niro productions 'em at their um offices on granted street\nHe contacted are based on his experience you know how to call the bomb squad directly you\nSpoke to the bomb squad they advised him to also notify the first precinct 'em and they went directly to the scene they were met by emergency service um with the first precincts were able to locate based on the ah security directors um instructions the\nPackage where he described as a the bomb squad was then able to use their expertise and equipment to safely a package that intact\nOr remove it safely from the building and then place it in the total containment vessel which is our bomb a transport vehicle and bring it to the Rodman snack range where joined um the other devices that uh we got from CNN and from um\nThe FBI in Westchester County authorities or by late this afternoon all of those devices should have been transported by\nBut by late this afternoon all of those devices should have been transported by the FBI to the FBI lot a lab in Quantico to be examined by their explosives people so that all the evidence of from all of these incidents are in one place\nAt especially like to commend the work of the J few the F a was in the command post last night as they've pulled I'm an amazing effort together with other joint terrorism task forces around the country to run leads\nUm and with FBI Headquarters the work of the intelligence bureau detectives or under ... who have been assisting as a virtual extension of the J. P. T. F. as as leads come in\nThe public for calling those leads and not just to the FBI hotline but I'm to the NYC safe number that goes door off desk\nOr we're up a hundred and thirty nine percent in those goals so when we ask people to come forward they do it a particularly to the bomb squad I'm a detectives and supervisors who\nWhether it's one o'clock in the afternoon or or in this case five o'clock in the morning or right there with the right equipment the right training and know what to do um the emergency service people who drive that trough\nAh with the device in the back highway people who escort them um and of course all of our partners postal inspectors ATF um and uh and of course the J PDF it's a large team effort and um and and we're looking for um the continued help of the public\n\nEye for me to take some questions that cigarette\nFor free for\nThe war [noise]\nSo we're not going to as a bill said we're not going to give you a hundred percent accurate description of what the devices war but we ... we have to treat them as as a live devices a this is a protocol that are bomb squad people use and it keeps everybody say step in the background [noise]\n\nSo we don't know what this time but ah with the postal services that that are here are we're doing the best to make sure that if there were any out there we identified and quickly back\n\nAnd also are you in office for your ticket and then why\nAre we are transporting or whatever evidence we have down to Quantico and as far as ah the powder which is going to leave it as to what Bill said that it's not biological and we're still testing it actually in the background\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nFor [noise]\nFilled you want to talk about the the first part of your question and John you get the second part what we're doing proactively which was the first part of the question again I'm Sorry\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I'm not going to get into a specifically where we think the packages came from\nI'm

I'm\nSo ... so you host a show and you are to you host a show on bold TV with Clay Aiken um now the reason I wanted to have you on today specifically is because I often talk about a faith on the program\nAnd you had an experience in twenty twelve actually early in twenty twelve you wrote an op ed or that appear I don't even know where it appeared was at the Washington Post okay so ... was in the post the Washington Post about\n... what it would be to have a Mormon president you were raised Mormon and obviously Mitt Romney was you know it was looking pretty good it was looking like he might be the next president and you you worked for Glenn Beck who all we're in a joint\nVenture we were we were at producing our talk with him after that it was after\nOkay yeah well in any sense you grew up in the Mormon church okay and so you had kind of like a political conversion in a religious conversion and it's pretty fascinating and since I've known you you've been to talk to these in the city here in the city we have mutual friends how do we get into that conversation where shall we start\n[laughter] ah\nWell ah\nAs as Julie Andrews might say we can talk at the beginning I'm not a very find places that are yes we'll begin with ABC now they're Amy I asked my family's originally I'm a multigenerational as\nMore of an ... person but uh my ancestors helped found the Mormon church I can give you all of my ancestors stories because Mormons are obsessed\nThose are not even Mormons that who can okay so you have a ... you go all the way back to the founding of the Mormon church is\nMy great great great great grandma and change on some black was a surgeon slash midwife who helped save the life of the guy who went on to become the third profit John Taylor who is in the jail who was shot when judge Joseph Smith the founder was killed\nWhat year was that when he was shot when he was killed uh I'd have to see that sorry\nYeah I mean I Know I'm thinking it's like Eighteen they well\nThey yeah they got they they are the things that arrived in Utah in Eighteen forty seven so it would have been probably a few years before that\nYeah for some reason I think Eighteen forty two okay but it it doesn't matter we can look it up so wow okay so you were raised a not just as a Mormon but as a kind of Mormon royalty hires horror and yeah yeah and so what what happened in your life\nWell as as I read about in the post and I just said I was a journalism major at Brigham Young the Mormon college and funny enough ah my thought is bracing in life was to get married and living in a cul de sac and have eleven children because my cousins had ten and I wanted to beat them as I\nDo\nSometimes may have other plans but okay have\nYou have you told me I'm listening to talk of Clay Aiken pretty about record it to the high school which carry I think you're insane yeah and I am but yes but that I'm right at so basically\nI had this goal to be at bat housewife and that's that's the Mormon women are are a condition to believe right or that that was set up by the\nI actually am not a Mormon but I think that's a great thing\nRight ah that that was said by the way I actually am not a Mormon but I think that's a great thing snow I Love those women I've ever met her were housewives\nHey hey you will not hearing you say anything that in fact it really upset me actually when uh the Democratic I forget her name she was insulting and ... around me and said that she'd never worked a day in her life and I'm like the one that gave birth to five boys\nWell that's the ... well ... when she ...\nShe could just stay home and baked cookies and you realize that well in in a way housewife has itself become a pejorative because\nIt's really inaccurate in the sense that anyone who has raised children full time there is infinite work infant at work and that's if you're not home schooling them and I meet women who home school because I'm thinking you were a teacher you're like this is just\nIt's kind of you know stunning what is involved so yeah what let's so let's start there\nYeah I guess I I never planned to have paid work I should say yeah I plan to raise eleven children which would have been a lot of work a which is of a different kind um and so yeah I Know what I\nWas three you can go you can go to his own defense instead of men are man it's a little bit easier\nCheck um [noise] but basically a and again yes there's nothing I I I I think true feminism is is empowering women to make whatever choice they want whether that's thing at home and raising families or working and doing a hybrid or fulltime working and not having kids I embrace all of that so\nAh but as far as why I chose journalism funny enough part of it was I just thought it would be a non threatening major that when I'm a threatened male Mormons who might want to date me because I wasn't studying something harder and I could just be a nice little as\nLike maybe freelancer on the ... I wouldn't have to worry about threatening someone and this is my thought process\nBut at any rate I get to BYU and ah eventually through a my journalism courses and just doing research I came upon a lot of information that ah with outside the official curriculum that really troubled me about at the Mormon church in terms of\nThe lack of transparency the lack of ah just the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there where what whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this a\nPristine image of Joseph Smith and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime yeah and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that at you and knock you'll eat them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're right completely I I thought\nWhen I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wise that they were young like what what would you like\nThat like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also they were married to other men because they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to heaven\n...

accurate factual document\nA and that the Smithsonian was using it as a guide for ancient history and the Smithsonian issued a letter that said please don't use our name that's not true\nUm because the book of Mormon purports to be this ancient document of a record of Jews who left uh Israel and moved to America um before the coming of Christ and that when Christ died before he rose I or appeared after three days in that three day period he came to America\nAnd I've been thrilled frankly in the last Thirty years to to to ... more and more uh archaeological truth ah you know document proved\nThat that it really is true it's not just the point of view of a bunch of people who say don't question it shut up there's a lot of that everywhere but I I have been privileged to be around

things\nYou're founding reporter at Politico you've just done all kinds of stuff you've interviewed Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Cairo are you reported a on the twenty fifth anniversary of perestroika in Moscow you've been all over the place I'm\nNow very recently though in your life you did something really important I was not really clear on this you had left the Mormon church but you said for like twelve years you were kind of ... and then something happened within the last year\nExactly yet uh I got baptized December third twenty Seventeen so just over I write about eight months at this point as bad as at St ... church which I Love at St Thomas\n... yet yeah there's just to be clear I'm usually aren't baptized as long as you want to be clear well and so yeah\nI Would say Mormonism is Christianity it is I I just think sadly that they they put a lot of justice Smith into Christianity and that\nThat's a that's a big conversation a ... I don't want to help an early no there's no time but that's the conversation is it Christianity or\nI read it now and in fact I found my might to Mormons are except the journals because of the founding and so I kept a journal since I was eight as baptized when I was eight as every good Mormon candidate I kept a journal since I was I read my journal as a young girl and even at age eleven and twelve I was talking about how much I Love Jesus and at the time I ate it I said\nI Hope that I never forget how much that I Love Jesus\nAs I went back and found my journal I was like very hairy baby carry you just yeah for twelve years that didn't happen at so ... for a lot of reasons but I think that the biggest problem is that that Joseph Smith inserted his own ego into the Christian faith in his interpretation\nThat I mean and there but there's a lot of doctrine that's not agreeable and went\nOn for me was polygamy er and that's a big part of why at lots of reasons but that's\nWhat about all all of them who they who they say Jesus is or isn't through you know the\nNature of of Jesus in God and yeah right exactly there are lots of things that are at outside the Bible but so you spend as much as you mentioned a core of of Jesus as the son of God that's there's a ... their\n... and that's what makes it so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care or it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well God looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nOr if you really honestly love Jesus and you you know your worshipping him in your heart then it's ... I guess I always look at the Narnia Chronicles you remember in there where there's this um there's this Keller means kind of like a Muslim and in his heart\nHe's worshipping as one but he doesn't know the difference between cash and as one and when he sees asked when he realizes this is who I have confusing so it's interesting because some people get very few logically\nUm precise and ... so anyway I don't I don't want to go further into that just because we only have a few minutes but you when you wrote the article\nYou're you're basically looking for an opening of Mormonism I have friends in the Islamic religion saying the same thing like we need to be open otherwise what you know we become hide bound and dead and we can't even um we can't even decide what we believe because if you ask a question people to shut up\nAnd of course that up in the Catholic Church you know about five centuries ago and I wrote a book about it but\nThe last line in my op ed says that we need a Martin Luther for the Mormon church so ah but I wasn't going to wait around for that so I left that I actually went to a\nDifferent Christian churches in the DC area for about a year but I left for lots of reasons in part because I didn't I didn't have a direct relationship with God I was confusing religion with the relationship didn't realize that religion is what people do in relationship is what God does\nAnd what did you find that relationship\nI I just last year so that's a mad because I realized what had happened was I\nHad replaced my meaning in life with the gifts rather than the get rid of the gas and I thought that I Would find a deeper purpose in a deeper meaning through public service because that was the here and now that is sacrificing myself for something that I knew for a fact because it's tangible\nAt to me and I actually think that a lot of young people go through this too and I think that\nThe ... you know the belief in government as a source of higher power or hair meaning I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of government that's Kennedy said JFK in many ways became my messiah you know assassinated and sacrificed himself and um I I my my", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "26"}
