Noren good will of the voters of the state that's where we've got a central\nAnd when I when I listened to the rhetoric that's coming out of 'em are out of Washington and when I listen to Democrats bait and when I listen to\nYou know people like Senator McCaskill who I Know she's she's trying to she doesn't vote like a modern I Know she wants to to maintain this this image of being a moderate but she definitely doesn't vote like a moderate and when I hear the pilot when I hear what they're putting out there all I hear identity politics that's all voters here\nMeanwhile you know as I said you're on a bus going through beautiful Missouri countryside which I can only imagine the laser now starting to change in fall starting to hit Missouri in Texas I Love misery falls in Texas all the leaves fall off at once right after Thanksgiving and at all it is we don't get a fall there is no father's just dump\n'em at still beautiful state though don't get me wrong I don't want to have now\nUm but you know you're you're out there you're talking to farmers that the president has made some key and Republicans had made huge strides in terms of a farming and agriculture I mean he just you know how to pressure the other day where he was announcing energy ... energy policies\nAnd all we're hearing from the other side and it feels like a repeat of why they lost and twenty sixteen is well ... when I was a gang rape is um men are toxic et cetera et cetera I don't think Josh when when you're out there talking to voters they're not\nNot interested in any of that stuff 'cause none of that stuff is going to pay the bills and keep 'em employed\nAnd I tell you what are what they are interested in the Democrats' plans to take it all the way I mean here you're the president just secured major new trade agreement with Mexico with Canada sort about Missouri farmers the most it that's a big big deal those are two largest trading partners right there by a bottle\nAnd the state of Missouri that's really good news for Missouri farmers but you know ... know thanks to Claire McCaskill\nShe has done nothing for years where we are getting ripped off\nBy the Chinese and others are now she wants to raise taxes on the middle class that includes the course\nOf Missouri workers Missouri farmers are they want to throw open our borders a she wants to preserve Obamacare come hell or high water I mean he doesn't care before Obamacare no matter what no matter when no matter how much it costs ... families\nI mean this is this is the kind of thing that strikes fear in the heart of Missouri voters and it should\nBecause not only do they want to block everything that the president has done the last two years they want to take it all away now they're willing to do anything in order to get power back and this is what we've got to stop all\nYeah and and I ... that really definitely you know you were mentioning to just the biggest trading partners just to\nYou know my home state your current state there Missouri just at the biggest trading partners is really I mean it it affects voters much this is what affects voters their rhetoric that we hear on Kavanaugh the chasing her senators down hallways and yelling at them and screaming at them about toxic masculinity and et cetera et cetera\nThat's that is not is what is helping Missouri agriculture is not what is helping blue collar workers in Missouri and and this I and I've never seen\n'em this uh the incumbent that you were a challenging in as much trouble as I have seen her lately and I have a lot of family all around Missouri at a huge family\nAnd they have been forgive him for many years they were Democrats a lot of them cannot bring themselves to continue voting that way anymore for the very things that you just mentioned because it actually is in fact I mean you're you want to talk about how she was completely silent over\nAs as China was allowed to dominate they've been paying they've been writing the checks\nSo long uh for all the bad policies that have come out of Washington DC that McCaskill was just a rubber stamp for\nYou know they have ... middle class in this country in the middle class of the state of Missouri\nTo pay for their disastrous policies that have sent jobs overseas that opened up our borders gave it floods of illegal immigrants coming across driving down wages that increased crime gangs drugs and they want us to just go back to those days to start paying for again we're not going to do it\nIf they want to practice the politics of destruction\nAnd combine that with the far left agenda that they are ready to oppose other country I mean you just look and see if if the Democrats took control Congress showed us what they'll do they want to teach justice cabin on we already know they want a piece of the president they talk about that nonstop\nThey want to raise taxes or they want to open up the borders are McCaskill sponsoring the most radical open borders bill in American history\nThis was her play on this is ... this is what they're going to do and this is what this election in November it's about saving our country is about whether or not elections matter and we could save our country that's overlooked\nNow the president went on the office today with an op ed in USA Today were and he was saying look by by supporting this kind of a Medicare for all health care policy that ... Democrats in both the Senate and house say they're going to make sure that they said if they have in they take with in power\nAnd those chambers a and he said it rightfully that it is isn't it just creating Venezuelan style socialism here in the United states for health care health care was always a huge issue in Missouri Obamacare always a huge issue in Missouri\nWhere voters telling you about it just you know some of the some of the proposals that they're hearing from McCaskill and other Democrats because they would love to essentially salvaged the very parts of Obamacare that this administration has got a day they basically free mediocre care for everybody but\nIt's going to be a lot more expensive\nA free quote unquote for some individuals what are you hearing from voters on us\nOr people told me is they cannot afford their health insurance taste Obamacare you know instead of Missouri\nFor some individuals what are you hearing from voters on us\nPeople told me that cannot afford their health insurance thanks to Obamacare you know instead of Missouri health insurance prices are a hundred and forty five percent\nJust two thousand Thirteen hundred and forty five percent all of that by the way for this president took off of it on him that's because of Obamacare and people do me they can't pay for it because the Ford it they're going to have the ... circuit jobs are at a spouse back to work just\nGood for their help your previous people with preexisting conditions ... I've got a child with a preexisting condition but I mean this is folks cannot afford to pay their health insurance bill in order to get the coverage they need and yet what is Claire McCaskill is or answer is learn to like it\nYou don't stop complaining ... we're going to have Obamacare forever she's not going to do it and give up your costs down and as you said no we're party says oh what is going to go to private insurance completely I mean it could all the way it could ever go to the government run health care\nSo to be a disaster it would cut Medicare it would be a total disaster for seniors and roll yeah\nExactly well and I she's she's struggling you guys are are incredibly close how do you ... if you guys are really close I mean you have really a when it first started I ... when you when you first launched your campaign I don't think that\nUm McCaskill anticipated that it was going to be this tough but this isn't in a completely new era\nAnd voters are fed up and I and I don't think that her party's behavior that is the past several months have have have helped her case especially her lack of condemning it and in some instances seeming to encourage it\nUh I don't think that that's that's that's help at all and um I think a lot of people are looking are looking for a change very much I have to ask you ... you go just tell me about the fall in Missouri or the leaf changing color\nYou know it's it's it's getting really beautiful but it's been a cool bigger than that we were we were just dead earlier ... county ... degrees a loser turn red and orange is pretty nice of you\nKnow the everything is green hair and there'll be a ... degrees and then of the day after Thanksgiving\nAll the leaves fall and then that's it I say I'm gonna have to get back home

that so we're going to be we're going to try and kill meeting a couple of minutes um\nIn our two today we have Sebastian Gorka and now I Love Sebastian Gorka he's like a heroic figure we've had him on this program many times but we have not had him in person so to be very very exciting to have him in person in the studio he's\nDoing um a you know a big push for his brand new book why we fight\nA he really is very inspiring figure and so I'm going to be excited to greet him right here in the studio and he's a big figure to he's huge is huge mhm\nYeah on TV looks normal sign on everybody MTV looks the same size teeny tiny but everybody on TV looks the same time I actually know what no joke I remember I was at the Nineteen eighty democratic convention back when I was a Democrat and I went to the convention was in New York City\nAnd I remember I was sitting up and I and I remember it was the last day the convention this is Nineteen eighty democratic convention so Jimmy Carter of course was the nominee but\nTeddy Kennedy had tried to rest the nomination from him which is an amazing thing ... and the two of them appeared on the stage it was like the you know the kumbaya moment at the end and I will never forget\nLooking and seeing Ted Kennedy was giant and Jimmy Carter was released small like a peanut and he you me Kurdish probably be ... I met him he's about my size right and but Ted Kennedy is a huge figure\nAnd it was so weird because I'm Dee Dee everybody looks the same size and so for the first time in my life I realized it's deceptive because just because you're seated on the TV screen you know a ... and you look the same size as the other guy went in in person Ted Kennedy was huge enemy Carter was you know I haven't found him but dandy line of the Senate's number two of\n'em so [laughter]\nShe\nKorea all the young people just clamoring for a\nFor cheap trick and so we we play that we want to get that demographic speaking of which coke if you watch Fox and friends you know that every morning it's the same thing they have a a pretty blonde girl okay now we're friends with her we like ... and there's two guys

when Michael code was the number one story\nNever heard of ... yeah that was like two years ago right\nIt's actually it's bizarre I don't know where it goes\nFrom here speaking of stories you know you were you really aren't usually the person talking about stories and you don't become a story but the other day because I'm a New Yorker who ride the subway almost every day I I had to ask you about this\nYou had something happened to you very recently some people know better maybe some people don't tell tell us what happened you 'cause you're you're very well known face your on TV or on Fox News every morning what happened to you\nI mean very simple um I Do the same thing every day\nUm I don't I don't know what I read sometimes you are Black Friday sometimes you do so for talker a next week Ken sometimes you can do our number ... right after I I have no way of nowhere and lead so if the New York it any more money with New York you have to use public transportation\nTo get into a chart so over Twenty years I go to subway train and I was spotted by two people hostile a box or and these guys will there I guess they have a website and all they did is just\nJust yell out negative things without the box um Trump mostly\nWhen you have to sit there and you hear yourself how what what's the best way to handle this right\nThey're not directly I don't feel physically threatened I Can't reach ... or you know the other one was within reach but I don't want to give it will viral ball which I'm not going to give money to do\nSo I just water\nAnd I actually emitted my daughter had a game it's older teen I had to get on at three o'clock trade so I literally just hopped on the subway they followed it they try do they try to radicalize the whole subway\nGives you know New York or a stroke and they try to get people to go after many people yelled I got out onto Penn Station at ten minutes I got a couple of calls I got a smoothie and all you see on this tape\nIs guys yelling here like kill Moody's crushing the country and\nDonald Trump his ruling the country and he ... and that's because of him\nYou know well well you don't you ... you must not realize Brian uh\nBut the media has made it very clear Trump is Hitler to point out\nAnd if you don't come out against him you're part of the problem you realize now what what's going on right\nIt's very simple yeah if you don't agree with that ... if you don't agree with that or you're in you're in big trouble I listen I had a thing on the subway the day of the election two thousand sixty November okay\nA bunch of thugs got on my subway car and they screen down in a very intimidating way you could tell what they're they're looking for trouble because they hate anybody on anybody here vote for Trump because this is like the polls won't even close yet\nAnd being a cranky angry middle aged man he only won on the subway car I looked at these guys who are like you know Twenty one years old and I think I\nI'm a I Will kill you like if you if you dare you know to say that uh we don't have freedom to vote in this ... you know I got my backup you know I'm from queens right so I said I voted for Trump\nAnd all hell broke loose these guys went nuts\nAnd when I got off the train finally this gigantic guy next to me he said hey I just want you know if anything went down I was going to jump in\nAnd there was another guy a older than me who started screaming these get ... you you don't realize that there are people just sitting there that they don't think this way you know so New York is filled with every type I'm Sorry very sorry you had to go through that\nThink it's just fascinating because they were forced to boil it down most of you know I'm not saying the most popular guy in the world almost every year
