show friday hope you've had a good week\nChills this weekend God Bless all of you thank you for listening to me or follow me on Twitter at Walsh freedom or a year ago in Montana it candidate for Congress a Republican candidate for Congress\nWas asked a question by a reporter\nHe didn't like the question so that candidate for Congress picked up the reporter and body slammed him\nThrough him to the ground and then that candidate for Congress jumped on top of the reporter and started punching him\nIt doesn't matter I guess that at first the congressmen to be a denied that this happened until he was caught on tape the entire incident was caught on tape\nBut that now congressmen uh was arrested or he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge a instead of going to jail or he had to you know do community service anger management had to pay money to the reporter\nWho suffered injuries so that happened a year ago\nAnd the president found himself in Montana last night at a rally and he got to talking about that incident last year the bodies slamming and he had the guy Greg gene forte he was in the audience right there and the president proceeded to praise\nWhat gene forte did he applauded what gene forte did\nAnd the crowd loved it and the crowd loved it I I just think\nAnd I'm I'm actually curious the snow chill friday\nIs there anybody misty who's going to call me who thinks it's okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who asked him a question\n'cause if you don't\nIf you don't think it's okay for a congressman to physically\nAssaulted a reporter and by the way I think that's really important distinction you can laugh at people in the media you cannot come you can say hell I ain't answering your question you can walk away you can do whatever you want but to physically assaulted reporter who asked the question\nIs if it if you don't believe that's okay\nWell then I don't know how you can approve of what the president of the United states did last night because last night the president of the United states approved\nOh he loved ... gene forty did he applauded that he thought it was a great thing he praised it\nHe said Jean forte he's my kind of guy hey Devon give me ... number one again\n\n[noise]\nHe's my God give me ... number two again deaf and I heard about it\nThat way indoors read very early but I had heard that he body slams a reporter [noise]\nThink it was way up and I said oh this was like the very\nEnd of the election or just before and I said oh this is terrible ... elections that I said well wait a minute I Know Montana pretty well I think it might help them by the\nGreat thing great thing it was awesome what he did help GM forte when does that's Montana in Montana they love it when you beat up members of the media great thing in the crowd went crazy\n\nSo many of you rightly called into this show when Maxine Waters encouraged people on the left to get in the face of members of Congress\nAre people who worked for Trump is Trump's administration that's just horrible she's encouraging violence Joe that's terrible that's the mob that's like mob behavior\nBut here's the president United States encouraging physical violence praising physical violence against the media\nPraising physical violence against the media\nAnd I hope I hope\nMost Trump supporters out there aren't saying yeah bring you know\nThat's a great thing body slammed that CNN reporter let me go to Dan Dan your turn\nJoe I gotta wonder are you turning Democrat because if you do they're going to teach you to not go against your party and slam every candidate those Democrats they keep their mouth shut so I I don't care if Clinton raped seven Lewinsky\nHey Danny words date when you stand ... shot up and\nDance stay on with me don't leave don't hang up stand with me you asked me a question let me give you an answer and then I'll ask you a question in my turning democratic God no I I've never been a Democrat in my life let me ask you a question then\nIs it okay for a congressman to physically assault a reporter who asks him a question is that okay\nI don't believe it's okay for him to assault reporter but why do I have the skill lease and all those Republicans no job no and\nHear anybody apologizing for raising it\nReadily Dan and they're still doing it you know ... it'd be like that hey Dan balance all over Trump Dan Dan\nIt's all wrong isn't it physical violence correct\nWell sometimes it lead it and that will wait wait wait\nWait wait wait but if if if a reporter asked you a question and you pick him up and for them to the ground in punch him that's not appropriate right\nI didn't I didn't say that was appropriate but don't don't have the hammer Trump area than [laughter]\nOkay good I think we made some progress there it's not good it's not good and when somebody on the left gets violent and it's not good when a Republican gets violent\n\nAnd I don't think it's good when say somebody on the left get violent and then Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi says yeah man I Love that did you see that that antifa thug a punched Ted Cruz that was awesome\nThat would be a horrible thing for a Nancy\nPelosi or a Maxine Waters to say just like it's a horrible thing for Donald Trump to say did you see that gene forte he body slammed that reporter that was fought so [noise]\nYou know I hate to say this and I'm not a violent person sometimes violence as necessary [noise] even if I don't\nKnow I appreciate your opinion man no Jim I appreciate your opinion I just want to be clear I really do that's what this shows all about so what do you have a question you don't like it's okay to physically assaulted\nI'm going to say no but I listen to what Trump had to say and you know like the last you are taking it too far the guy was getting a crowd going he was having some fun\nWith it he didn't mean it\n... brother Jimmy I appreciate your opinion I appreciate you listen\nIs your daily civil
