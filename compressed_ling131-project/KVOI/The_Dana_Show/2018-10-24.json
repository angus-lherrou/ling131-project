a November twenty sixteen they know that it's not a winning issue\nThat's it\nAnd so\nThis they want to they want to present this is this is a human interest story ... ... what was that I saw her was this um it was something a a huge percentage the majority percentage of the people are men under the age of thirty five\nThat are in the care of and I'm going to let me get this statistic um because they the yeah about eighty percent Fox\nHad reported and it's also partly as a couple of places that have reported this uh about eighty percent are men under the age of thirty five\nUm\nSo that's kind of\nGoes against the whole let's all women and children et cetera and there are some women and children in there but there are just that there are the minority of those who are participating\nIn as it's been reported so that's you know a huge it's a huge significant that er that's a significant number\nYeah and and when you look at the video and the photos while there are a couple of women every now and then as some children the majority of them are men in fact I was just actually looking\nI'm at a photo a editorial of when I guess the bridge was too crowded so they decided to a jump in the water and take raft across those were all men\nThere was one rats that had one woman and child on it and the rest were men\n\nSo about eighty that's roughly I guess a rough estimate about eighty percent they say are men under the age of thirty five\nWell that's kind of [noise]\nIt's a huge story and then if it's going to play right into mid terms uh\nGoodness\nAnd they and have you noticed

would rather be lied to them push for answers because they view being called being having your character and tune in being smeared by progressive is worse than\nBeing lied to ISIS crazy to me no they're not they're doing everything they cannot to talk about the the the mob that's marching everything they can because they it is a dangerous story for Democrats\nDangerous story\nAnd that's the only at some point they're going to have to address it I think that they would\nBe better off doing it earlier instead of later because if you do it later that it's just it's going to be even worse

Christie what a story or he is the author of many many books he's currently a adjunct professor of philosophy in comparative religions\nAt Indiana University in Kokomo I just wanted to say Kokomo Corey welcome to program\nThanks it's a real privilege to be here with you well\nIt's a joy you've written a number of of books are you hold master's degrees in philosophy biblical studies and in the philosophy of religion and ethics and you've got a PHD in philosophical theology from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland\nYou really you've applied your mind or to studying the things of God philosophy all of this incredible stuff so tell us or if you would do about the organization ... Ciau Christie what is that exactly for folks who don't have a clue\n[noise] Russia Christine means the reason of Christ at the center organization that has its focus like a special ops ministry a campus apologetic serve Angeles so we were on to quote students and faculty with historical philosophical and scientific reasons for following Jesus\nWell that's pretty impressive I have to say university students really it's an interesting time in people's lives typically of course a university students are so open minded that they can often taken very very bad ideas that may haunt them for the rest of their lives but at the same time because they're open mindedness\nUh there's an opportunity to reach them and obviously that is what you're trying to do how do you do this rescue Christie\nThat well we have a status clubs on campuses similar to campus ministries like campus crusade aggregators sets us apart from\nThose ministries is that we focused intently on apologetic evangelists what separates us from standard apologetic ministries is that we focus on the campus because we think that's the most influential institution of western civilization right now\nWow uh well I I Love it and and you grew up you did not grow up um a as a follower of Jesus where did you grow up\nMy ancestor was Joseph Smith ... personal bodyguards and so I'm a sixth generation Morgan from Salt Lake City Utah and it's like coming out of Mormonism and being shocked ...\nTruth claims about other religions or realities that they pursue this statute of truth and that's what brought me into philosophy in comparative religions where I'm at today and happily is a Christian evangelists\nWhile their politics it's such an interesting thing because I Know so many truly truly wonderful people who describe themselves as Mormons they say that their followers of Jesus and I and I think many of them are\nBut we're talking about the doctrines of Mormonism what was it that made you see that there's something in the doctrines of Mormonism or that or not\nConsonant with what we would call historical orthodox Christian faith\nOriginally it was a myth doctrines it was an existential counter that I had with Christ I left Utah to go to attend a camp in California\nOnly because I got to stay there for the whole summer with a friend if I were to tennis can cause death that the precondition Andrew I heard the gospel for the first time it really made a difference to me I never really understood by sharing sharing I never really thought about hell\nI never really saw grace as being a gracious and it literally transformed me and then I saw for the first time I'm Christ and people not religion and that's what made me a you know see that there was a fundamental difference\nIn the community that I had been raised in a while when I came back to Utah for my senior year of high school that's what I was challenged by my family members and friends and community that maybe I carry very bad mistake as a sort of ...\nI've got a hit hit Larry in future ahead of me on the tourist Hitler perhaps if I knew the truth and I left it so I was challenge to read through the book of Mormon again this time for the sake of truth in that tradition\nAnd that's what I started seeing all the holes and it made me wonder okay out while I go out of luck Mormonism how this foundation of the Bible\nIt left Mormonism how this foundation of the Bible and Christianity is a true or trustworthy how do I know God he didn't exist and if so which God and that's what set me on to this trajectory\nI I just might so fascinating how God crates everyone's so differently you are extremely rational and of course the organization is called ... Christi but it's interesting to me how you responded you know in other words you you have this experience with Jesus something happens\nAnd you're you're trying to figure it out and then you're challenged of course by by the Mormon community a ... ... ... and in some ways threatened and and so it forces you to think beep or another he didn't just react emotionally you said let let me go and see if I made a mistake and so\nYou you for the first time I guess looked more critically\nA at at Mormon doctrine and what was that experience like for you because so many people um you know they're part of something and they're not really thinking is this true or is this just how I was raised and what what was going through your mind how old were you at the time\nRight and that's that's part of a growing up in Utah culture and the Mormon community it's more driven by sociology and psychology families Are Forever than it is I feel like she had a logic\nAnd so it wasn't until I have that exist actually counter that I began to ask deeper questions [noise] um but I had you know started to distance myself in my immediate community from the sociology Mormonism\nBecause of some of the hypocrisy that I see I didn't ... myself from the moral theology that's all I knew that's what I had that's what I believed that only came a little bit later and that's what started the challenge me about Christian talk and others thinking and I never was\nGiven to this kind of rational thinking I I had a zero point three GPA at one point\nBut it's why I came to know Jesus that knowledge became a huge factor in my life because after all that's why the goals in life is the knowledge of God\nWell it's just an extraordinary thing and it's amazing how God has used you to challenge young people today to think more deeply you find on campuses\nUm that uh that people are open to this kind of thing I mean what is it an open somebody at that age or to do to Jesus I'm just guessing it has to be got in that person's life but I I I'm just curious if your experience\n[noise] yes and I think you know being a university or is the first time many students are away from their homes after Christian students away from the youth histories their churches their families\nAnd now they're seeing all these other people from different parts just around the country but there's different parts around the world and they're hearing messages from professors that are almost predominantly a non Christian secular and sometimes hostile biased to understand right\nWell yeah I and I and I think that that um the forces of secularism have in many ways overplay their hand and that there are so many people that there's such an arrogance about it that you kind of think well gosh what are they hiding or one of these so emotional about\nUm that that they're they seem not willing to even be a open minded about the possibility of Christian faith and of course Christian faith has affected so many people positively over millennia\nIt becomes ridiculous when you dismiss Christian faith and demonize it I think you know most bright people see that they say wait a second I I'm not sure that you can characterize something that way because much of the good that's been done in the world has been done in the name of the Christian faith but you only seem to hear in the modern\nCulture the negative things you know uh and and so it is a it's a strange time we're living in culturally speaking and I and I just think it's interesting but you go right to the university 'cause you do realize that

up the billboard charts as we speak I'm Talking right now to Corey Miller he's with Russia Christie's in front of them were Russia Christie dot org um what are you working on right now Corey you've got so much going on\n[noise] well I'm I'm working on a couple of articles and books but really trying to plow forward with our ministry and we're developing a more and more an army of ministry two professors\nOh that's interesting that that seems to me a\nA a tough job but an incredibly worthy job so many professors are afraid I'm to dissent from the um the from from the guys I suppose from from the guys on universities which is practically Marxist a\n... year really is dramatic ah how places that one's embrace\nFree thinking in the best sense have have been close to it over over a number of\nDecades\nRight and I think one of the reasons why are we industry is so important in trying to equip students are at high school and college while they're at the university and just before they get there is because of the rule the professors professor\nReally is the most influential posted it most influential institutional western civilization and right now I'm In the Washington Times said that the\nRatio of liberal or conservative professors this twelve to want for those that are sixty five an older retiring\nBut for those are coming in younger scholars it's twenty three to one in some departments like religion it's Seventy\nTwo on and so I really think this is a field that most people are not reaching it in a sense it's like it's like it on reached people group it's the ten forty window of the western world world view it's\nOne of the greatest delicious of the great commission because if we can get it for chess or we can get their classroom to for Thirty years\nIsn't an amazing thing uh I I just have to take my hat off to you and and how do you go about this and how many campuses can you beyond and how many professors can you reach it seems like a ... vast mission field\nRight I mean that's huge we at one point five million professors in the United states and collectively between two other ministries that are going after professors\nProbably only warn hungry campuses out of three thousand five hundred campuses you got a single staff person there to minister to them\nSo we're trying to develop a movement to national professors are on the line as well as on the ground to chapters well about a hundred and fifty campuses right now um where we can reach the digital population and how professors to reach other professors\nWell it's just an extraordinary thing I Know that there are a lot of a closeted Christians on campuses that they they just don't dare uh talk about it they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs and you think what an extraordinary place to come to\nA in the academy where people are afraid to speak about what they think and what they believe simply because they could lose their jobs it's just extraordinary to me that were in that place I'm In a in the academy\nA [laughter] I have firsthand experience with this Eric I think this is one reason I decided to\nKind of include protests to straighten my overall I'm calling\nIs because during my PHD program at Purdue I lost a first pitched in my fifth year because I was told that too much faith perspective so much for academic freedom\nAnd so I finished it in Aberdeen, Scotland and then when I was you know teaching at Indiana University one of the satellite campuses in Kokomo I teach and I I use standard textbooks most of them are atheist texts that I use\nA I was teaching ethics I have a former pastor a church gay and when I got to the place and human sexuality and attacks I get an alternate perspective on it from\nA you know biological standpoint and are getting it from\nA theological and so forth and\nI got taken to task I was charged with creating a suicidal environment in the classroom\nAnd I had to bring in alliance defending freedom to take my case pro bono to atheist students actually came to my defense said a leverage to be a university to listen to my lectures what you're actually helped get me exonerated\nSee this is extraordinary or you don't know this but we are doing a fund raise with the alliance defending freedom right now and I didn't know you were going to bring this up but I Want to use it as an opportunity to remind my audience", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "24"}
