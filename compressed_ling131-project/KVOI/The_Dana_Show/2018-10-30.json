a scene that are Marge was talking to Lisa and she's written an entire book in order to make it an offensive and and Lisa says quote it's hard to say something that started decades ago and was applauded and an offensive is now politically incorrect what can you do and afterwards she looked at a picture of output says don't have a cow was an autographed photo\nAnd she goes some things will be dealt with at a later date that's what merge that I think it was great because the literally the entire show was built on a stereotype and if you don't understand that\nThen why in the hell are you talking about it that is literally what\nThe show was it was a humorous celebration of all of the stereotypes and when you look at every single one of these characters every single it wasn't done it wasn't demeaning I mean whether\nIt's you know the the the grounds get grants give her willy the Scots men weather or whatever it was I mean it was it was John as a way to mock American cultural perception\nThat's literally what the entire basis of all of these characters is is mocking American it's a humorous mocking in celebration of American cultural perspective\nThis is how you fit everything through like imagine there's just a perspective on television like Instagram has filters and it's just the American filter that's I mean it it was supposed to be light hearted and funny and everyone's ruining everything and they're trying to make it to where everything is offensive to absolutely everything\n\nAnd property rights over it in or oh I think as an Indian American what bothers me the most about this in this entire thing is are continual culture war is it a few like minded left wing Indians are trying to dictate how Indian Americans the American society\nThe truth is we're doing fine we're currently the richest most educated minority in America we litter the halls of academia medicine and even Hollywood now our voices are heard in the White House the United nations Congress in statehouses across America if you want to pick a minority that has suffered from media bias sees the last one I Would pick his Indian Americans\nWow I mean it's a good piece but\nThis I mean it's just kind of it\nIs they're just so they're just going to drop him that's just that they're they're just the the thing is is there they're going to drop and this is not\nA\n... there is [noise] it it the mob wins because the whole shut the whole show is\nBased on stereotypes of the mob wins so at what point does the mob when I started coming for ... for other characters mean winter this winter Scottish people gonna get mad about ground keeper Willie when are the\nItalians gonna get mad at all all the Italians being portrayed as mobsters I mean I could go on and on\nThe problem was much bigger than most because we've seen it how\nComedy has been attacked in the ... comedy in general right not not anything you know another thing specific and now they're starting to get a little more specific in that realm of comedy as far as who they attack in what they believe you know who they were to signal towards essentially my um so this was an attack on comedy\nSo even if you weren't a fan of The Simpsons which I don't know why you wouldn't be\nUm this is a bigger thing for me I think this is just another cog in the wheel of destroying comedy in the name was PC culture\nRight now I agree I mean and and isn't it kind of sad that they're just going to take him out I mean they're just going to get rid of supporting him so you're just going to get rid of\nThe most successful character who happens to be a minority on the show us what progress has been left these ones\n\nYeah Andy so anywhere first published the interview was um id shank are who told the site that uh people at The Simpsons and that was going to be dropped from the animated show\nAnd apparently they verified it from a several people they're just they're not going to make a big deal out of it but they're going to drop them altogether to avoid the controversy\nWow\nAnd so now all the people are like wow this sucks there's so many ways to make up who work without getting rid of another not\nYou're you're a moron because you don't understand ... you don't understand that this was an entire show that was built on stereotypes of the American perspective not an demeaning way but in a way that\nIt was a light hearted that was the whole thing I mean I'm not freaking out because of the way Marge is represented or the way that men Flanders is represented the Christian nerd I mean we can sit here and go on and on it's insane\n\nThere's there's no they've they've now assailed comedy\n\nI mean they're they're now going after comedy\nThat's what they're doing in comedy is the last place for any kind of free speech people don't want free speech they don't want any speech with which they disagree\n\nI mean that they do know they do not want any speech with which they disagree\nAnd that's what it all comes down to\nI mean this has nothing to do with 'em and you know what aggravates me\nUh\nWhat aggravates me and I was looking at um Christian Toto has a good piece where he says\nThat actors are not standing up for their fellow stars they can't stop sharing their views on every other topic but if they think the Contra controversy is overblown or they are they said to the anchors area the voice of a fool out of a good\nYou know they're not saying it and they're not standing up against social justice were so just cancel the whole damn show just cancel the whole show\nAt this point\nAnd you have other people who are in Hollywood that are watching all of this and they're scared of it because they use the social justice ... coming after them too\nAnd that's where it is\n\nI mean it is uh just\nUm it's all comedy shows or parity of reality all comedy shows so yeah so if The Simpsons who has the huge history and track record of comedy what what chance do other comedy shows have in this\nYou need it cancelled the show\nCancelled the show because heaven forbid we hurt anyone's feelings\nYeah\nBecause everybody wants to be a humorless odds just you know can't then just go ahead and and cancelled the show at this point I'm going to be offended then over margin that's landers and everything else and the portrayal of the sisters\nIt's so ignorant where the feminist on that the two perpetually single sisters that mark has\nIt's just everybody get up let's just everybody like just\nFreak out about everything good grief\nYou wouldn't have wouldn't Christians have been all upset about how they portrayed in mid Flanders\nYeah the ... that Christians are endlessly complaining about things is why that's why everybody feels comfortable mocking Christians because we're not going to cut somebody's head off or blow 'em up\nWe're not gonna we're not going to state massive protests outside because we're just at this point we're so used to taking it it's you know it is what it is\nWhich is sad and anytime a Christian fights back the whole world freaks out anytime a Christian Baker fights back oh my gosh the world is ending how dare you comfort to persecute us what we're like you're just standing up for your fate you can't stand up here Faye simply existing is considered an act of aggression by many people on the left\nThat's why

I'm I'm On blocked by the paywall too but but the the latest liberal talking point is that on one issue that psychopathic killer\nWho hates the president and call the puppet of the Jews says that the types in his car words are from our our our spoiling everything and he doesn't want to make a America great again I didn't vote for Trump and he hates Israel and they can't stand any you know anything about Trump because he's a puppet supposedly obviously we\nHave the Jews yes right and I confess I Do them puppet of the Jews actually one have you Jesus the Jew but go ahead\nA puppy cause\nThis guy hated one guy in particular at this in a God who is involved and bring refugees in North America and because Donald Trump wants to limit the number of falling refugees entering America like the ... or a caravan marching natural from Central America that\nThis guy murdered all those Jewish people but he happened to overlap\nOn the very edge is with Donald Trump on one political issue so it's Trump's fault that this happened that is literally the logic that is\nI ... I just want to say the strongest term it's possible that when people use that kind of rhetoric\nAnd when they politicized something is horrifying as this I I Know that there's a lot of emotion but I Want to say that um this is not good for the country we have to come together as a country we have to come together as a country\nAnd stop blaming everything on Donald Trump it's no different than when everybody blamed everything on Obama you can hate Obama and everything he did\nAnd consider him one of the worst presidents in the history of the world but he's still the president of the United states and there's kind of rhetoric which are unhelpful to everyone in America some respect for the presidency whoever holds that office\nIs the modicum we should be able to expect in our public life that's it and so when people when people say things like that I just want to say I think it's tremendously irresponsible by the way when when you're talking about how complicated I mean let let's just go for a second and say imagine if I said\nThat the man who sent these bombs around how many where they're fourteen or something like that right now\nWe're living in such politically correct times it's absurd okay he\nSent those bombs to all the kinds of people that I strongly dislike but the differences that as a Christian I'm commanded to love my enemy so if somebody I think he's doing great harm and his my political enemy um command it to pray for them\nUm so the idea that just because somebody had certain political views and he did this I mean it's really it's irresponsible it's childish to do that but what I wanted to say John I don't know if you have any commentary on this the guy he sent the bombs around okay we're talking about the first guy a\nHe was you know he did for a living\nIt was a male strip him in a male stripper aged out so became a promoter\nStripper and he he had a house he a U.S ally ...

A. L. and Puerto Rican independence terrorist group that claimed responsibility for more than a hundred and twenty successful bombings from between Seventy four and eighty three they blew a\nThey killed\nSix people injured dozens this guy was sentenced to decades in prison built a sorry Brock Obama set him free\nAnd then if we're going to talk about radical extremism\nBlock Obama never dark and the dog or a church and killing came across the trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago which was a Marxist church headed by Jeremiah Wright right\nHe preached black liberation theology which is which is like communist ... liberation theology Latin America except that focuses on race war instead of class war that's where Obama went to church for years Jeremiah Wright married\nThe Obamas and baptized their daughters it is only ... good morning America air to clip of Jeremiah Wright ... yelling God damn America\nThat only then did Obama rule actively distance himself from I met a lot what Jeremiah Wright said about it he said that the Jews are going to let him talk to me I told my baby daughter that he'll talk to me in five years but he's a lame duck or an eight years when he's out of office so\nFar up Obama's spiritual mentor\nWas an anti Semitic Marxist his political um that Torre was a weather underground terrorist any set a Puerto Rican nationalist murderer and terrorists free from prison\nNow you why didn't we hear about that well\nI think this gets to the to the heart of the matter is that the reason Trump was elected and the reason\n... or the GOP will probably prevail in the midterms if everyone votes\nIs because I think that finally in America there's an anger\nAt the mainstream media people realize that for decades or the truth has been kept from them and I and I think it's been a building thing but when stuff like this comes out and you see the way it's reported its grievous then in the United states of America\nA mainstream news

happened or didn't happen um you know back when they were in high school or they were friends or he's had a rough life mark judge but he's really come out on the better side of it he he's a he was an
