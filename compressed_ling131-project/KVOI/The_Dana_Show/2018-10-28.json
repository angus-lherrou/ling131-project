times usually in context of being a Christian he goes oh you're a Christian so you hate all women who have had abortions homosexuals alcoholics and so on\nWell I Am very very pro life or if you will anti abortion but I don't hate anyone including people who perform abortions or who have had one yet some people who don't even know me I've decided that I hate certain people\nI think lesions that there are people who do hate those who disagree with them and they logically as incorrectly assume that if they hate people they disagree with then everyone does\nWell today the big focus on hate is our commander in chief and those who support him\nAs we're seeing today hate will often morph into violence all of the politically related violence that I've seen in our nation in the past couple of years comes from those on the political far left the specifically includes antifa anti or what is your column or a classic example is a fascist Nazis\nBut we see people who are active in politics are elected officials or even people who just wear a garment with the conservative political symbol or message they're being attacked so far most of the attacks have been verbal but some of them physical\nThese hate motivated attacks on people are totally contrary to the way of life in a constitutional republic like ours\nAnd then we have members of Congress and other leaders openly advocating violence against their opponents including the president worse they go on condemned by anyone including the media\nThis open rejection of our constitution disagreement is not only okay if at least a rational discussion that can lead to a positive change we don't want everyone to think the same way this is the culture of socialist fascism communist societies yet it's sure appears this is a path our nation is on the haters anyway\nI have to spend with my life the right of our citizens to peacefully protest against things they disagree with but that does not include screaming in the face of a legislator disrupting government meetings are blocking access to buildings I guess it does include rushing like an idiot and parading around\nBut do you know that when those groups do have their gatherings or for age they leave tons of trash behind\nPicking up after themselves seems to be beneath them in our country doesn't need this attitude as a part of our culture\nNoses the mainstream media seems to support this hateful approach towards our president he certainly is not perfect but he's already done a significant number of very positive things including a vastly improved economy with the company lowest unemployment rates and lowest number of people on welfare and decades\nForeign policies just returning respect ordination hey look at an ambassador Nikki Haley in the UN was Korea look at Israel and now we're dealing with China and Russia and Iran from a position of strength yet he's still Haitian\nPresident Trump is to address the family Research Council a Christian group they believe that homosexual is soon so some have called them a hate group and they're putting Trump down for speaking to a hate group huh\nAnd look at justice Kavanaugh he received death threats is home was vandalized and his family threatened and he's not the only one people attack like this are hostile to our constitution what they want is for all of us to think and speak only what they approve\nMy greatest fear is that the clearest unstated goal of the radical far left is to overthrow our constitution they're attacking our president with a goal of getting removed in a constitutional republic the way one deals with an unlikely elected official is working to get him or her replaced in the next election not violence like we see today\nViolence is the exact way Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party took over the parliamentary democracy of Germany prior to World War two we have to stop the hate filled comments and returned to intelligent dialogue\nDon't have to agree with each other and everything I don't think that's possible anyway we do have to take the hate out of the communication you know I pray for hate filled people hating her social life as a hate are much more than it hurts the target of the hate but political hate also hurts our nation our kids just my grow up thinking there's such behavior is acceptable\nTroops with someone get through to hate talk just end it leave it was necessary if there is talk of violence suggested as he legal and anti freedom and you plan to call the police what happens we have to take our nation back from the haters while we still have a constitutional republic and those are my comments for today\nIs disgruntled any going you're listening to the front lines of freedom now we've got to enjoy some more wisdom was cheap one officer all nationally but after they roll\nOr cannot were in the thick of the political season with midterm elections just around the corner however the department of defense so strict rules about how members of the U.S military can participate in politics so what do these rules cover\nThe department of defense encourages active duty members to vote in established several programs to help active duty personnel register and cast absentee ballots\nBut when it comes to actively campaigning for a specific political candidate the military draws the line it should be noted that these prohibitions do not apply to members of the national guard and reserve unless of course are currently serving on active duty\nNow active duty military members can and should vote they also may express it personal opinion on political candidates in issues they just can't express those opinions as a representative of the department of defense or the military active duty members\nCan sign a petition for specific legislative action or a petition to place the candidates name on an official election ballot\nThey can also write a letter to the editor expressing their personal views on public issues or political candidates however if the letter Dennis ... of member as a member of the military and must clearly stated that the views are expressed are those are the individual and not the department of defense\nNow here's one I thought was kind of interesting colonel maybe you saw this when you are on active duty\nA political bumper sticker can be put on a military members personal vehicle however large banners are signs are not allowed what this means as a yard sign in a military members home is actually against the rules according to the department of defense\nMilitary members can still attend rallies fundraising activities and all the other things that we would do as a normal citizen as long as they're not in uniform and not treating the appearance of any military sponsorship or approval\nWell here's an interesting one military members cannot speak before a person political gathering including any gathering that promotes a partisan political party candidate or cause\nIn general active duty military members should avoid any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associated in the department of defense or the department of homeland security with a partisan political activity makes us\nNo active duty military members males will not hold any civil office and the federal government requires an appointment by the president\nThis prohibition does not apply to retire to reserve members however if they'd been called an active duty for more than two hundred and Seventy days they actually have to get approval from the secretary of their service to allow them to retain the public office or even run for reelection so just imagine that congressman who's a reserve is\nWho gets recalled active duty to go let's say Afghanistan for a year\nHe actually has to have this service secretary approved\nHim to keep his office kind of an interesting perspective isn't it it is a deep well bottom line folks is the military members should get out and vote for the most part they should shy away from getting involved in in political race until after they've left the military yes we have some reserve members were also\nAfter they've left the military yes we have some reserved members were also politicians but we don't have any active duty service members who are currently politicians and you know what I think that makes a lot of sense it\nDoes to control the military use the right answer sank eurozone very appropriate very timely I appreciate your pal\nStraight ahead on front lines of freedom will review some lessons we should have

and so I just wanted to tell stories not just of the battles are not just the of the generals officers part of the soldier or what it was like for the common American soldier or to\nWell you did a good job of that this is colonel dirty going from I was a freedom where's the Holocaust with all sorts jak Sacco jak I'm sure listeners are going to want to see how can they get a copy I guess Amazon

is the name of the website and they can get one directly from me or they can I say go to Amazon are pretty much any book store you get it\nWell I recommend you do it jak take a minute now in some up some of the key point you'd like us all to take from our conversation\n[noise] well\nI think the main point is that I Want people to understand what the American Soldiers have met with the American military has met to this country these are some of the greatest people who have been in this country has been the American military and the more they have done\nYeah and sacrifices World War two they you know these guys came out of the depression they went off they save the world and I want people to really understand and I think they might get a feel for that they read the book\nThese guy said the world and you know what they were up against the world would be completely different and unrecognizable as these young men who are teachers and farm workers and and you know gone left the homes that they lost\nAnd travel to a distant land to fight really for people they did not do they not only fought for the people there they fought for our nation and our freedoms are our way of life and they came back\nAnd they built this country and showed that phrase of the greatest generation I Want people to not only a realized how true that is but I Want them to get to know a few of these guys personally because I think it not only is not just about my father is about all up and I I Know that\nA lot of people can relate and and and another nothing I can add quickly is that a lot of the world war two soldiers\nDidn't talk about when they came home so I get a lot of information a lot of the emails and people telling me\nShe and my grandfather was in World War two of my father worked there my uncle or whatever and they never talked about it yeah and I knew that had gone through a lot of things in this book allows people to see what their fathers grandfathers a or a you know family members\nOr what the American Soldiers went through and what they would the emotion pet day style and how strong they were and how they ... they were these\nWere the heroes and these were the liberator and these are the guys that saved our our nation\nCouldn't agree more with my father in law falls into that same category jak thank you for taking time to join us today and thank you for

what attracted you and what not and some of the things you've done\nWell one of the sort of track to me was that kept the goofy stuff going on at my local city council is a great example just talk about but I'm from a little town we have two hundred twenty people by horseback to work for very laid back and yet we ended up in our little town with six\nLawsuits against the town too by the federal government we had an ... a hundred and fifty thousand dollar debt but ... is just crazy\nAnd I looked at that said you got to be can we can do better than that\nAnd so I really started working with groups in town to get better candidates and that's where I recognized the quality got much better than the leadership ... and ...\nTroy I recognize that quality government is no better than the leaders you elect and that if you don't pay attention to it that the people who turn out and vote will elect leaders as it turns out only two percent of most studies actually choose the winter so they were lectures\nSo it's very few people if you look at the city of Houston to great example a Houston to far just sit in the nation\nHouston by itself is larger than twenty six states population wise and generally four percent of the city of Houston chooses the mayor which is the equivalent to sneak up on our twenty six days and only two percent of that four percent of what it takes choose the winter so essentially two percent of Houston's population chooses the equivalent of a deal or twenty six states\nAnd I'll let them said there's no way I can sit by and let crazy things happen when two percent of the ... in the winter\nAnd so that's where I got very actively involved not only in recruiting candidates but happy candidates Ron I have a political office in Texas for nine years I'm a firm believer that you can have good laws get constitution but if you don't have good people ministry and up to half those beliefs you'll never happy to get my\nWell that's absolutely true it's a

up a ... thing and a bomb shelter underground in a very small eight by ten room we didn't have any electricity they didn't have water we didn't have any food\nTo get some food was call out under the bombs and you would the guy with the dandelions and different vegetation that grow rather a bomb shelter it because it was the only greenery we had to eat to get some water I Lived in a town called Marcia you and valley of springs\nAnd to get some water with crow to a nearby spraying under snipers bullets what used to take five minutes ... hours crawling in a ditch\nAnd every time we left the got some water we would say our last goodbyes because we did not know if we're going to come back alive or dead just to get a drink of water and this became my existence and I live in that bomb shelter from the age of ... the age of Seventeen Rob but my youth\nOn reducing this new country in a new one ... serves syringe new a new blood\nUm are nine eleven here is run to putting character to

your wherever you are not to read you an arm on the show the great American stories along modeled before dying money stories Mummers job to stay in history American Dreams and marriage so much more\nAnd then here's your stories on the topic for every weeknight\nWe're looking online in our American network dot on hope you join the campfire and call in with your story [noise]\nSchool going to continue our conversation with your Gabriel terrorism expert in Germany for America the largest national security grassroots organization in our nation and all through the new book Raj\n... we're talking about the domestic threat to our nation by radical Islam this is not theoretical this is going on today we need to be aware of it\nTalk to us about what we as soon as as as parents need to be making are huge in our communities aware of and this is not the heat Muslims which to be aware of threats and my right\nAbsolutely oh we need to be aware of threats and being aware of threats has nothing to do with hating people look when you have a security system in your home whether ADC or any other place not because you hate your neighbors\nBecause you know that unless you lock your doors at night\nThat may be some that that was what happened to drive in front of your neighborhood and who may come into your property and break in the door and he just wants to protect yourself you're saying my name is our dogs do not saying that a lot because I had all my neighbors on my enemy you're not going to get your neighbors\nKnow doing it for the fact that there was a possibility that back people can wander into your neighborhood and break into your home I think the church is all the time and I ask if that's what I said do you like your chance of nights and of course they look at me like of course we like our church with and I said well if you want all refugees to come to America you want us to have open borders to welcome everybody\nBecause everybody who needs a place to hide they need to be able to\nOh just walk into any place and it's our duty up and people were welcome arms if that's your philosophy why do I get surface at night but I don't keep them up as any homeless people on the surface air condition it's heated this kind of kitchen you've got plenty of space of threats from the peer review them at that and spend that either your church\nAnd they don't have an answer for that because they know what I'm saying the truth and that is fat and so this is why we have to protect ourselves but another chapter in my book rise at a very important and it is titled operation indoctrination\nAnd it talks about what's happening in our school system and it is a must treat\nFor every parent out there who has a child going to school or had a child who is about to go to school or every grandparents have got a child at the public schools or even private schools because the books that are being taught for right now whether and public schools and private schools are approved by the state board of education\nAnd what's happening right now is Islam ec radicals had enough on something when America's textbook publishers\nOh history but professional studies books on how the just the public schools and so they have a course\nAt three week course where students have to study Arabic or an oversight and memorize verses from the core an\nAdopt Islamic names won't go to Moscow on a field trip texture it's what it's like to be a Muslim now they're doing this while Christians or Jews or Buddhist or Hindu or any other religious minority\nI bet you already in our country cannot even discuss religion in the classroom as a matter of fact do they even like Christianity I barely mentioned and the best books books out for example there's a book called the ... century [laughter] the pages of the book I dedicated the Saab Christianity has two pages\nAnd that is not right and so I think what's happening in the public schools and the white parents need to be engaged and involved in every chapter of the book at the end of the chapter I have a section titled rise up and act\nWhere I get people to the ideas as to what they can do to make a difference for the country and the chapter on operation indoctrination isn't particularly important because it deals with the future generations and what they are taught about our country\nUh them the truth and lies\nAnd we owe our children to teach them the truth so this book is a must read\nTo everybody concerned book is titled rise it is available in our book stores nationwide as relevant Amazon dot com\nAnd listeners we're going to give away a copy of rise at the end of the show but I agree to go ahead and by the topic because your your limit us women but I'm delighted that rises of their one

responsible I can play for you for the next two and a half hours all the cuts from people on the left as well as people on the right saying really bad stuff about the other person\nAbout the other side there's lots of those soundbites so\nYou don't like it okay but they have the right to say those things you have the right to yell back yet I'm quite bluntly but how do you get to the point where you you try to craft bombs\nThat's because when all is said and done here when you cut through all the smoke of this whole thing this guy is a mentally disturbed deranged individual and how he hooked on to a political\nAnd he's got a whole is holding up signs welcome to President Trump a on his sign and he's got Nancy Pelosi a yelling and uh they target symbol over her face\nYou know like a gun
