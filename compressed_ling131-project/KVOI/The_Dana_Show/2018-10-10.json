stop\nAh and ah that's where it's due respect to vice president Pence who I Irish I grazed esteem core\nYeah that guy can you imagine that would be CNN that'd be a good ticket though for twenty twenty four I have to say that would be a fantastic second ... who is who do it 'cause I Know that there have been some names tossed around to step into her her spot that nothing has been confirmed yet the president has said it take you know a week or two weeks\nI'm but is there anyone that and I mean do you anticipate him taking someone's similar to her style 'cause she was pretty hard line she did not mess around I mean she was\nDiplomatic to a point which I think you kind of you have to be ... at the un because you have people who are sitting on human rights council than themselves guilty of human rights abuses so\nIt's kind of an exercise in irony even participating in the United nations in any sort of governing there who do you think would would that would if you had a short list\nUm would be um ... would be considered\nWell the president has bought more or less intimated he already has a list a and like I can tell you that uh I have I'm not on it and I don't know the people are that are on it uh but\nThere should be on it I Love to see you there [laughter]\nI thought you were my friend but [laughter]\nThey definitely have I think\nNow the blessing of following someone like Nikki Haley cheap cloud a lot of ground to basically say someone who can be diplomatic and the sense of getting things done uh but you don't have to respect people not worthy of respect and you don't have to respect institutions on worthy of respect\nAnd she wanted to do the business of the country I think she did a good job of it I think that's cut someone from the Trump law to to go about our business they're that way and so I have to believe that it's going to have to be a somewhat similarly disposed person whether it's from the\nHill or from a state I don't know uh but I if it's just kind of the run of the real diplomat that's just way out of central casting\nFor this is going to strike in my view that would be a real down her from my ... like I say she she almost makes you want to believe in the un again which I Can't yeah\nYeah now do you think there's a chance that it could be a family member because some of the speculation is that it could be and I think this might just be because Haley mentioned a Jared Kushner and Ivanka a win in her remarks to the media she sat there with the president\nUm 'cause he was involved and for instance and within a mile and a number of different things but do you think that that's a possibility that are we reading too much into it\nUh to me that is a fantastic offices because I Can't imagine a liberal left to explode\nAnd that was a and there's just no of you know I don't think that\nThere's any reason for Jared or the bunker to do anything other than what they're doing I thought it was really interesting good investor Haley\nA pointedly went out of her way to give give them credit\nOr something not that many people in Washington a good willing to do and I don't doubt that they have been playing some important roles behind the scenes frankly I was amazed at the first lady went on a an interesting Africa trip in almost no one wanted to care if she was doing good things with good people and\nPeople just wanted to jump back into the pool and so I I think it's interesting that journey they've all been able to do those things but my goodness\nWhat a ... a just an absolute freak show that confirmation area would be if if a family member or put forward\nYeah we thought we ... the confirmation hearings and that whole process was an oh my gosh I Can't even what you know what it would test particularly if it was a ... like I I don't know if I'm at at the down for that because it it's a little too Kennedy asked for me\nBut at the same time I would like to see the reaction so I'm torn Stephen just ... totally petty reason\nSo you think there are heads left to explode I I'm\nJust wondering that might be some yeah I think I might be Saddam is that ... that oh my goodness and how and and before midterms oh that that just go ahead and just tweak that Republican enthusiasm\nAs we get ready to go to the go to the vote before\nUm defiantly that one other like this is a quite a departure from what we were just discussing but I have been\nA very interested in this weird story coming out of Saudi Arabia about this this journalist Jamal ... who apparently had disappeared and then he was critical of his country's government\nAnd there are all there's all this speculation because he'd people don't know what's going on I ... I actually read a story where they think he could have been murdered and then chopped up into a suitcase and then carted away by official\nI a Saudi state vehicles I have no idea but they say that it could actually impact Saudi Arabians relationship with the United states what do you know about this\nI don't know much more than ... and the press and it really comes in the context of this not being the weirdest disappearance in the world given the the Chinese\nLeader of Interpol yeah you're in China and so ah something is clearly broken\nOut there in the wider world in terms of uh people who are supposed to track down other folks getting disappeared\nIn countries that are not necessarily bastions of democracy and human rights having no problem disappearing folks at the rest of the world should be watching out for a while but I I don't know anything specific about the Saudi case\nBut if you said I Wonder if like that for a show or a\nMovie I wouldn't have believed it\nI Know well and and the the individual who was a who went the Interpol chief arrest this guy\nNamed Hong way was Beijing apparently announced that he was being held for corruption but he he was he was getting even than in his job that long a that this is that coupled with the fact that all of these stories that I see also with regards to China of\nUh some of their companies are like for instance super microcomputers Inc\nOr that they've been tampering with components that have been down for the United states and I mean just to put in layman's terms there's given me out\nAs they should really we're kind of coming to a head with what's ah what's going on with China or vice president Pence gave an historic speech I thought on the full range of concerts\nThe storage speech ... on the full range of concerts domestic your domestic they're an international with regard to the try to challenge\nIt would've been headline news if not for capital um but uh these things are going on with chips and our

know and we have\nWe have that big old technology firms that seems aside war with the international society and they do with the Chinese are doing doing with our own country based on the things that they want to say about the president and were were ... so you know I think it is a scary time that way\nVery much so and um which is why I'm Glad the administration has a hard line against a\nA China

Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said\nBoys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex well\nI don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender flew it I have in my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child in the ...\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this ... as ... daughter was using the restroom as a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade or as Pashtuns daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho but who ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nMaintenance man I mean there's a saying\nYou know we live\n\nThe earth's axis show and we're talking with Matt Sharp who's a senior counsel for the\nAlliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty um met I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty or in America why do you think it is that\nWhat really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago is suddenly an issue an alliance defending freedom has to step up and be defending all kinds of people left and right because there's so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that wasn't happening some decades ago\nI I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage him and his desire to\nDo his artistic design with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American\nWell I guess the other ... no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I just could say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these belief you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view is wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even holding such as\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight\nIf you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote you better get your friends to vote and you'd better if you can give to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonize is people of faith\nHas bigoted now again you know I always want to be clear\nThis is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up\nFor everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem\nTo think that biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nAre there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are or the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listening carefully 'cause I don't want to anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is a man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now\nWe're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this ... Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all of them might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing of view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty\nOf people who have traditional values so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these head games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nThe it's now incumbent on your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who were either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending eat principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be\nHas to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even enforce on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to\nGo local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and Walker and other changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you if people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say all the people listening to me right now\nIf this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy or ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government whatever it is get involved at least vote\nFolks at least vote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party of Nineteen eighty\nThis is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream are are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine\nIdentified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where\nWe have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're

I I Want to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what ... was asked to do was disgusting\nIt was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this says this was absolutely foul sexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and we just wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\n... if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become as a nation what have we become\nAs a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this ah Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in a in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think as a country we need to change our laws but we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak Philips has not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the lines of freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this should have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously and the ice depending freedom has to defend them um I mean this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body\nBut give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting the civil war when we were finding the revolution there are always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody it's just not us against them God Forbid uh the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't are so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom\nI don't know anybody that is doing this kind\nOf work right now so I Want to say go to Texas talked dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled up please give what you can visit folks this is why God gives us money\nAnd energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it hits tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way\nUh eventually they're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values when you say or where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn the lights defending freedom so the number in case you don't have a a website you can go to my taxes talked dot com if that's difficult", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "10"}
