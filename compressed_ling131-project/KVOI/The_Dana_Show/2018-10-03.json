I'm surprised actually that they decided to uh uh the New York times decided to say well it was it was probably I guess maybe inappropriate\n[noise] [noise] so but they act like he was involved but it was his friend it was not as fun it was the other it was this other guy that was arrested\nSo I don't know what they think that they were trying to do you know it's all like it's all about guilt by association it's all about\nThe uh they they want to go after credibility that's their play they want to make they want to put a seat of doubt in the minds of voters and that's going to be enough they won't even have to prove anything that will just be enough it's the credibility angle that's why they're shifting the goalpost\nThey want to raise the question they want to raise questions about how truthful he may have been during his testimony and they they're that's I mean that's as we wait for that to the next investigation to wrap up although Mitch McConnell I'm here and that they they even have a vote for writing\nAnd that's just a open debate that's not it's a\nProcedural vote so it doesn't change anything the big debate that the the big but won't have until the big the big vote won't be until\nUh later on so audio somebody twenty three it's what Mitch McConnell says listen here\nBut there's a lot of bribing ones I'm sure the shuttle will vote on Joe travel here on the floor this week here on the floor\nThis week\nYeah there you go it's gonna happen gonna happen so they'll have the vote to open up\nA the debate and then probably the confirmation vote the big vote that uh that will be next week some point because you have to go through some procedural stuff that's not going to be just a total you know vote on to confirm him and then it's going to be done there is a procedural stuff that they have to go through that's the way it works that is the way it works\nBut this\nObviously will be met with opposition from Democrats where I Would imagine her going to try to do whatever they can to stall as much as possible\nSo that is a funny way\nDo we uh the president is in Philadelphia and he's speaking right now on energy do we want to listen to some of his remarks you pick a minute or two well let's take a minute or so and listen he's he's speaking in uh Philadelphia on energy let's listen to\nSenator [noise] great job [noise] [noise] that's very impressive another success story in\nThis world and is great land of ours is Arcadia electric\nIn Ridgewood New Yorkers right where I grew up right near where I grew\nUp in the president's Steve ... is with us or she could you come up and tell us about a great success of your experience especially recently like\n[noise]\n\nSo the president in Philadelphia and if you're just\nThinking some folks there but he's been speaking on a on energy and uh uh which is obviously a big issue as well going into the mid term elections\nAnd um if it gets dark that it starts getting anything good particularly as a real 'cause sometimes he does water\nYeah about the fact that we're coming from a position of strength when we talk about energy right now because for the first time ever we are going to be an exporter of this type of energy ... in in in in the fact that our economy is booming\nLike it is is also another reason why other countries want to engage us as the market place because\nAnd we're talking even OPEC like you know how crazy OPEC is when it comes to gas prices in oil prices I think they're trying to do that to mess with the liars Henri in but I'm thinking the Trump moving us into a strong position like we are as far as the marketplace that is known as the American people I think there's going to be a lot of shift in that\nIn in the upcoming um I don't know several months year to whatever the case may be noted working it's working\nNo it is absolutely for sure let's go ahead and take it now and to some quick five\nThat fly producers quid five\nSo Steven Spielberg decided that I guess he wants to redo west side story and I don't understand that because I Love the original but they're ... they're going to cast the uh the star baby driver and ... he's going to be\nThe star

and it's a that one brain eating bacteria stuff\nThe Naegleria ... style Larry Sao Larry all it's a deadly amoeba and they say it's um it's it's yeah once you get it there's very there's only like a few people that have actually survived us which is terrifying\nThat's got to they got it and I guess going back to New Jersey and then it wasn't because of that quick and it wasn't long before he realized\nOh boy I'm In trouble Germany the immigration rules to tackle a worker shortage\nWhich I'm sure it's going to just make it so much better for all of the problems that they are already juggling due to their previous stance on immigration and so daily mail has the story Russia says there was a hole in the space station\nThe um I asked us experience to drop and pressure due to an air lake on August thirtieth and they're all these theories out there some say maybe it was a micro meteor I bought an initial investigation rolled out accidental damage as an option and the second investigation aims to reveal further details maybe even including those responsible\nBut Dimitri ... goes in who's head of the Russian space agency said that it down it wasn't I mean you're factoring

in fact Blumenthal and a tweet that contain three factual errors which they never elaborate on and arguably spelling mistake\nAnd he they never literally\nMentioned the fact I mean they just glossed over the fact that Trump was right and they said can you believe this guy that's essentially what they said so\nI retreated it and said shorter Blumenthal it isn't true because he made a spelling mistakes oh but it is true and here's the snow for one I Love it when snopes works against other liberals and then the New York times piece Richard Blumenthal words on Vietnam service differ from history and\nHe had said they had oh we they had his quote up what we've learned something important since the days I served in Vietnam a new exemplify it\nAnd there was one problem he never served in Vietnam he came five military deferments from Nineteen sixty five to Nineteen Seventy here the audio flashback of him pretending that he did listen to this audio somebody twenty four\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nMm let me read you to use the New York times there was one problem Mr Blumenthal never served in Vietnam he obtained at least five military deferments from Nineteen sixty five to Nineteen Seventy and took repeated steps that enabled him to go to avoid going to war according to records\nThe deferments allowed Mr Blumenthal to complete his studies at Harvard pursue a graduate fellowship in England service ... a special assistant to the Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham and then take a job in the Nixon White House\nIn Nineteen Seventy with his last different in jeopardy he landed a coveted spot in the marine Missouri reserve which guaranteed that he would not be such a Vietnam he joined a unit in Washington that conducted drills and other exercises and focused on local projects like organizing a choice for talks Dr\n...\nBut he lied a repeatedly about it we remember this piece of audio when he was actually asking Kavanaugh although ... years ago a\nFederal judge you are aware of the jury instructions saucers and [noise]\nUniverse focusing on\nAre you [noise]\n\nYou're worried about your instrument Australia\nYou know what it means you can trim whether it forms or you can do it better than I can fall in one thing falls and everything\nMhm yeah so I'm just like ... yeah yeah false and when the yeah it does it sounds exactly like Blumenthal that's a fascinating isn't it though yeah no I mean he he is\nThere I mean he's there with his he lied about it\nDon't it correct me if I'm wrong if I miss remembering which was what was that one of those things are one of the room and everything I say what are you are but in the beginning of this this hearing this are asking for an FBI Democrats were asking for limited scope of your investigation they're asking for a limited scope\nFBI investigation so now when they were given the limited scope FBI investigation they're out they're barking that the FBI shouldn't be limited when in fact obviously any branch of government should be limited but mhm this is again this is proof of that moving the goalposts weather not Blumenthal believe that's what they're doing it up\nYeah yep I uh I agree so I why should he get this why does he get to sit on the Senate Judiciary committee and a interrogate other individuals I'm just curious like why does you know I'm just super curious about all\nOf that you know just fascinating to me [laughter] [noise] but I'll make sure I put that video also up on on a Twitter seawall can see it because he lied about his service and then he's line of outline about a service I\nMean he's just lied about line about light about law at this particular point so my heavens so the ... ... ...\nI Want you for a moment really quickly I Want to focus on its

of September it was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping poses an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues\nClapping um uh they said a British sign language clapping or jazz hands is a more inclusive form of expression\nMhm\nSo jazz hands ... what are they saying the people without him though now they because death people apparently can't fill their hands I don't know\nThey say you can't that's I don't know they just said I they they said that but I have family members who who actually I have a family member who's deaf clap so I don't know what\nBut they say that it's more inclusive and that they want to use the jazz hands to express\nI bet they say that it's more inclusive and that they want to use jazz hands to express support\nWhat happens if you clap

Clinton investigation it's called contempt we're going to have Ken Starr on in just a few moments for the rest of the hour but right now\nI'm going to talking about something that is absolutely crazy and one of the most interesting things I've encountered in the last couple of years there is a guy named mark Taylor a who hears from God now you're going to say I don't know about this exactly\nWhich is why you need to be listening carefully right now there's a movie that is available tonight that's Tuesday a and also I think Thursday night it's called the Trump prophecy and we have the filmmaker on the line right now Rick Eldridge welcome to the program\nWe're going to be here\nWell listen ... my audience doesn't know anything about this I Want to talk to mark Taylor at length about this but this film is coming out tonight to fathom event tell us for somebody who knows nothing about it what is this\nIt's manic feature that basically the story of Mark's life mark as a public servant of firemen who uh at the end of his career a kind of like being in a battle do it in and out of fires and and and seeing some some terrible things obviously\nA was having trouble sleeping tormented by a lot of that and uh the the key date\nApril two thousand eleven he was a channel surfing three o'clock in the morning and here's this guy talking to a couple of international business guys they happen to be Donald Trump and uh he got this premonition that he was a hearing the voice of the next president\nOkay now I read that at that time pretty amazing two thousand\nAnd eleven he he's Donald Trump on TV and he believes the gods speaks to him and says this is the next president of the United states now\nTo believe that Donald Trump could be president in two thousand eleven is plum loco so what did market tailor the firemen think when Godspeed did God speak to him normally was this new thing for him\nIt's a very new thing for him and uh like I say it was three of the morning and he actually wrote it in his diary and and he put a question mark\nBy like really [laughter] and it didn't happen he kind of forgot all about it and wait wait wait I didn't have any any twelve is what you're saying\nYeah exactly and then uh you know several years later fast forward he was a um having some treatment with a doctor Colbert and uh you know shared some of his diary of this came up and Dr Culver was very intrigued by it now it's like being the fifty million is sixteen\nAnd a and it's a real thing and that basically became a move look of prayer across the country and many many of us know that you know the faith community had a\nI think a big part of\nA Trump becoming president and a big rallying point and um but this this ... call that a Nancy Colbert the doctors life started blew up servers all over America they were over a hundred thousand people calling in towards the ... as it got closer to the election\nUh every day and I am you know to pray for our nation\nWell business something my ... my wife and I\nKnow about this and that's one of the reasons I wanted to have you want to tell my listeners about this because\nThis is not crazy this is very very\nUm shocking when you hear the details\nBut I've looked into it closely enough that I take it seriously that Pete some people here from God mark Taylor is one of those people you just a person just like any of us are he's not some amazing scenes but he does pray and he hears from God and what I have read about him\n\n\nHave Bob was born in Little Rock speaking of Little Rock and guess what we're gonna talk about bill\nClinton um and the the Clinton investigation you remember the star investigation will you know who uh who conducted that yes his name\nAmazingly is Ken Starr uh most of you listening are familiar with him he was the independent counsel uh in the investigation that led to the Starr Report that led to the impeachment\nOf President Clinton some of you don't even know that President Clinton was impeached indeed he was it's a it's an extraordinary story from our history and I am privileged to have a the author of a new book contempt amend more of the Clinton investigation Ken Starr welcome to the program\nI think you Eric is so great to be back with you well\nFirst of all I Can't believe that uh you finally wrote a book about the one thing that people associate with your name this is a a dark period in American history it's not long ago it seems like yesterday to me and probably seems like yesterday view\nA but to hear your side of the story I have really long for this and so uh what was it that persuaded you finally to tell a story of the Clinton investigation I'm In your in your from your point of view\nWell Eric a combination of circumstances on a I've been very busy ah productively so I Hope\nUh doing what I Hope was Louis work at Pepperdine University at Yale University and then on the circumstances changed ... Baylor twenty sixteen I said I've got to write a book but it wasn't about to conduct this was about ... years how wonderful university is\nYeah we ... we talked about that a about a year ago on this program that's right\nExactly and so I was working on that through the fall twenty sixteenth something else was happening there was a cause of this election on right and then a hell he lost the election I searched or the Baylor book up their country of favorite story\nA and and I said okay Joe I Want to go back to full time law practice whatever volunteer your church were there what do I really want to do and\nI just felt moved all things considered it was now or never to write the story right\nThe memoir of the Clinton years because frankly as you know Eric there was so much on understood or misunderstood on the court Merrick and people\nYeah well uh it's an amazing story and it's all the more amazing when we look at where we are now in early October of ... Eighteen or facing crazy stuff the stuff with with Kavanaugh\nNow you new cabinet rather well and he was himself involved with you centrally or in this uh investigation\nInto white water and and the Clintons can you say a few words about him since he's in the news uh\nConstantly are as we speak\nYes my my heart has been breaking for a judge Kavanaugh is beautiful family [noise]\nI Know him and he was a not only in the investigation sort of like earth first colleagues ... going back to Nineteen Ninety four when he was coming off the courtship with Justice Kennedy was a pivotal number the team we\nWorked alongside one another he was universally respected within the investigation by the most wise and talk FBI or a ... a agents and and a great prosecutors to who it was the department of justice is most coveted awards\nFor the performance or he was young but it was tough he was honest a person of total integrity and then I practiced law with we're at a loss for the Washington DC\nUh he was a great friend by the way of religious liberty a job that's where it's we have time or in terms of his little commitment and then\nOf course as public services now quite well known so the allegations are so inconsistent Wyoming so with the Brett Kavanaugh who I Know who I Love\nAnd so uh I I've never met Dr Ford Adele hurt her testimony but\nI have the advantage of knowing Brett Kavanaugh and knowing him as we heard from so many people like\nAs a person of complete integrity of rock corrupt character\nAnd so it ... me that this has happened but I Walk on the side of the street I Hope and pray that was the FBI or in Korea now is completed that even with all the controversy he will\nGet what I think his sleeve deserved a seat on the Supreme Court stepping into the shoes of the justice for whom ed clerked after they do the\nRight well I I I Want to ask you um a couple of things is there's so much judge star and uh I I Want to have plenty of time to talk about uh your book I really am just so excited that uh the written this book the title is contempt for those who are interested in the title and of course the author can start with ...\nThose who are interested in the title and of course the author can start with two words as in Ringo okay so I Want to ask you before it\nGoes your love of music or get\nMalaria well not not going to get a fused with Richard stark he his previous name Ringo Starr and so they said we were talking about a ... well we're talking about current events when when we talk about Kevin ... the most grievous thing to me uh is is not\nThat ah\nI I guess let me put it this way he may be a stellar character but it's always possible it somebody stellar character at one point in like didn't have stellar character and did terrible things\nSo the real issue is how is it possible that was genuinely no evidence we are trying this man and the court of public opinion it's fundamentally an American in every American\nShould be scared to death that we adopt this as a way of going forward that we ceased to be America we ceased to be a free people and people are listening you ceased to be safe when we throw away due process\nWhat do you think is is going to going to happen because this is a dark day especially for the Democrats who have been pushing this along these lines\nI Would begin with first principles that emerge out of who we are as a free people going back to make a card that have audited the constitutional vilified singer so right\nDue process of law that's a little bit of a fancy way of saying as a child would ask is it fear is that really fear and I have a number of fairness concerns are pretty\nDeep ones critical like personal a love for respect and admiration for for for Brett ah as I I've been very vocal and my criticism about the way this scandal\nUh especially Senator Feinstein and then no one called you're really to task or on her side of the aisle so that it became just parts of the issue of the\nPolitical as they should have our Supreme Court with very much lament but it was feelings Frankfurt or waitress just on the Supreme Court from yesteryear who wrote\nThe history of liberty is largely history procedure when you think about that yeah that's right\nNow in court you need to have the right to notice what's this all about the right to prepare to hurt the right to counsel and so forth and so to the ... court but in the way this is a very acute at Torrey kind of cost us a assessing facts and so forth and the final details say is\nI think it was a terrible\nUh laments herbal rush to judgment that she must be right\nShe must be right not only that something terrible happened but uh she's identified the perpetrator\nAnd how can how can in fairness without a presumption of innocence and all those things that we hold dear we just\nCast those all side and simply say well it was about the Supreme Court so I Will rush to judgment I Will presumed guilt and I think that's just profoundly wrong so a Brett I'm sure I just called judge Kavanaugh so geared to me and I said that it that to the world I'm a grad\nHas been I think treated unfairly he called it a national disgrace for his perspective I think it is not just a family tragedy for him but it was beautiful but frankly I think it's a national tragedy will recover from it\nAs we always do with a strong people but I think we now need to have a basic conversation about fear that's just because someone a alleges something it's it's the old song goes it ain't necessarily so at least with respect to\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh and I just don't think it was I Believe ...\nWell but again it is it really so much about believing him as it is looking at the fact in other words let's say he said what he
