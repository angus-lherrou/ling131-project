time and so people actually donated their personal pets to the war cause after Pearl Harbor was bombed and that just stunned me uh they're better patriots than I because\nRacist one Native American activists said that walking by a statue is put in a prominent place that's another type of found that it's being imposed on me but if the gold rush that began a hundred Seventy years ago was a calamity\nThen California itself is a calamity the state exists because of the fastest migration in human history with nearly three hundred thousand newcomers arriving to seek instant wealth\nThey included Chinese alliance Latin Americans Australians and even native people from outside California the goal they drew from the earth built the federal treasury and helped make America and economic superpower for the first time I'm Michael mentor [noise]\nPepperdine graduate school of public policy impacting policy decisions today preparing public leaders for tomorrow [noise]\nI'm going to go and thanks for joining us today from the freedom that we should have been talking with US West point grad in front of my freedom contributor\nMatt have about the nature of warriors are going to continue this conversation now hey welcome back Matt thanks very it's a pleasure to be a give us a quick review of your time and mother army\nWow okay I started out kind of sneaking in under the wire at West point in uh the balmy summer of Nineteen eighty one I say the under wire because a lot of my classmates got the ... appointment through\nA congressman or senator and I sort of had an at large entry into the or the military academy but you know was able to uh fend for myself pretty well there to help my classmates and I was able to get an armored slot was what I wanted so I ended up going to Germany for my first assignment\nTo the uh three twelve cab which was that the visual cavalry swatter no third Armored Division and really enjoyed my time there be a lot of good friends\nCame back to the advanced course Fort Knox and then went straight down to Fort Stewart\nWith a unit and eating there weren't poor and was deployed for the Gulf War in early summer of Ninety Ninety spent the next ten months in the tropical paradise of or the middle east so and after that I came back I got out and went into explored the are\nThe jobs scenario or outside the army wanted to hang out with those civilian people\nThere was a number of reasons for that but we'll get into that later but I think it was it was a good step from\nYou know God must love civilians you may so many of them [laughter] it's like okay we're talking about warriors\nAs we discussed last week with autumn there's lawyers at every level of society and and as you pointed out a couple of times\nYou ought to be committed and focused as if you're gonna be a warrior we'll talk mostly military and again don't want to put down the other one is certainly as I've said a hundred times on the show people in law enforcement or not our brothers in arms but there certainly are first cousins and valor they put their lives on the line every day for people that don't even know many of them don't even like him\nSo please don't take that as exclusive but we're talking about people in uniform right everybody puts on the uniform\nBetter be prepared to become a war is that a fair statement\nYou know any of that is exactly what I was thinking it's funny you should say that because to be a warrior you need to train to be a warrior I think inside a lot of us think of ourselves as warriors\nBut the men and women that are going into battle they need to train every single day as closely as they can to replicate combat conditions because you never really know how you're going to react so the closer you can get to replicate those conditions and training day in and day out to be a warrior\nAnts you know your enemy no the order of battle the more that you know the more you trust the people around you the better you're going to fight\nAnd I think that is true in any scenario in life whether you're in business or whether you were in sports\nBut especially when you're a warrior you have to train and you got to know your equipment you got to know your friends and you got to know the enemy preparation is what you said and that is one of the keys to being a warrior I think well\nAnd in business you are not going to be competing for a contract and you want it and I don't\nThat's competition but it's not like a shot right nonetheless it's no less the same thing and the people who joined the military may be they never deployed maybe there was a guard reserves are never activated but they still\nHave decided for whatever reason usually a multitude of reasons with their lives available to resent the combat you might be a medic or you might be a mechanic or you might be a\nFinance clerk or you might be have a drummer you might be anywhere but\nIn the military you ask me what you want to take what you get and my dad's best friend who served in World War two as a replacement guy in Europe said you come in and you're a\nMechanic and suddenly we need fifty to tank drivers you're now ... [laughter]\nThat might be how you were trained but here in Egypt the arms of Lehman's for that yeah for sure and so therefore if you put the uniform on you better be ready to be a warrior regardless of what you're currently assigned does and that's I think a key issue this is going to Gilman front lines of freedom and we're discussing the nature of warriors with math have\nThem there are those who suddenly find themselves in a combat zone whether it's in a combat role or not I suspect that would appear motivation\nI Would hope so yeah I mean in in that and that's a that's a bad place to be it's a bad place to be in a combat zone but a non combat essentially non combat personnel and find yourself in a convoy that gets attacked I think unfortunately\nMany people don't feel they're ever going to be in close combat situation but if your deployed to a combat theater of operations you need to sort of get your mind wrapped around that where your spirit and say we can be attacked that anytime\nPerhaps even by civilians for whatever reason so you always have to be on top of your game and a ... again preparation and I think the mindset of being a combat warrior that's the biggest thing to be prepared for anything\nYeah I think the Marines have a sort of a model or something that says everybody's whenever\nI don't care what you are your primary thing is you're also an amateur that attitude would carry then there are those who\nConduct combat artillery fighter pilots those kind of people who attacked the enemy but don't do it personally mhm and then there are the people the close combat people the infantry armor special ops type people who are potentially go face to face with the enemy those are sort of\nDifferent levels but all of them need that warrior mindset and all of them sort of need to be prepared to be anywhere in that spectrum right\nYeah I Love the ... the marine mindset is that they train everybody to be a fighter and then after that okay you can go and be an electrician or a cooker because they need everything but all those and my wife says they all know how to fight\nVery similar to the Israelis everybody has to be good script into the army men and women so they teach everybody how to be in uniform\nHow to be a soldier and how to fight and protect the country and then you can go back to civilian life and be an accountant or a salesperson or an inventor or whatever but everybody has a taste of what it's like to surf and to be in the military and to protect the country important\nYeah it's really important person is more likely to motivate you to do that\nYeah it's really important person is more likely to motivate you to do that if you have seen your school will get attacked by a rocket or something like that you know you're in the United states\nGiven that the warriors spirits a warrior attitude is something that everybody in our military needs is something that needs to be appreciated understood and even replicated by we citizens because none of us but if you want to be victims either\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nDo not really aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level in in intensity and sometimes violence that the military has but they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life\nOf protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared to be very violent and that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\nAnd I think there are people in our society to think that we love the violence more out there just to kill people and stuff that's the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do\nAnd I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes each on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we're able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your body gets shot you do not have time to grieve not even a second you know the guy to pick him off got his crosshairs right on you but what are you going to do to get out of this position and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later when that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself breathing so there's\nThere's an intense emotional told and it takes on a person to be in combat but that's always got to be later it can't be in a moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks I'm going to have an Matt back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a warrior Matt thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for your service to our country and thanks for being part of the four hundred for them to\nDanny as always my pleasure thanks for

think we should do but members of Congress are already jumping on the bandwagon\nAnd a bunch of\nCorporations as well\nBranson says he will suspend his role\nUh although Branson says he will suspend his role\nAnd to tourism projects wildland investigation takes place he's also putting on hold discussions about a proposed Saudi investment in or his space companies a Virgin Galactic galactic and a virgin or but\nI think he had talked to them about buying in to these um space missions that he has he's been working on I think he got to either is getting or was pledged to one billion dollar commit but from Saudi Arabia\nSo\nAt this point he's got a I mean he's looking at a big big big big jak I Know he's a billionaire but I mean about a billion dollars is still a big deal to him so are people voting money over their morals and ethics\nI thought that yesterday to some extent but the more I read and the more I listed in the more I uh find out who the parties are you know all of this the more I think\n\nThat there are there's a lot of suspicious of finger pointing going on yeah you can follow me on Twitter the address Ed Sullivan radio ah Jackie is I think you're right on there she says first turkey had a video of the murder\nThen hoops no we just have audio if he's been killed than turkey most likely killed him and we are framing the Saudis\nGlobal is don't want the United states and the Saudis to be allies\nThey want war and the U.S seems to be cultivating good relations with Saudi Arabia suddenly turkey comes out with this outrageous story as every global assist screaming for the U.S to denounce Saudi Arabia and to quote do something\nSo this this to me is a perfect example of stories where you hear one side of the story and you make up your mind that's it I Know who's at fault here I Know who's guilty\n\nAnd so I at this point do we do we dare wait for a little bit of evidence\nTo find out what's going on because again you've got two people that do not like each other and turkey does not want the United states and the and the Saudis to be buddy buddy buddies\nAnd they don't want the Saudis to be a big partner with Richard Branson on his ah outer space companies\nBecause the Saudis are trying to reform and when you're trying to reform your shake it up a lot of people with a lot of money and a lot of power\nThere's a ... literally out so I think this story it may turn out to be exactly as first thought that they got 'em in the in the embassy and they and they killed him but I think we are a long way from a of knowing that\n\nSo now all these business folks CNN said we're out we're up but ... ... ... ... well at Bloomberg oh we're not going to be partners on this deal no but we're sending our reporters to cover it\nSo New York times CNBC they're all running for the hills I don't know who I was going to the ... and\n... is a weird collection of very wealthy liberals in Davos, Switzerland\nAnd the financial media runs there hey this is their boots for three minute interviews with all these big important billionaires so this is now being called ... of the desert\nI don't know what people are going to do but it is it's another sign of where I guess people have always been this way you make up you make your conclusions based on very little information and not a shred of evidence\nNo evidence whatsoever but you made up your mind\nWe do business with a lot of the various people around the world um some we get mad at some we looked the other way I don't know why I guess it comes down to that you take if you lose the money takes\nThe border you take the border with Mexico why are people crossing the border wire people wanting to come here and it's because their government to correct their governments are corrupt wherever they're coming from and they come because they want freedom but\nThe reality is we can't keep taking them and they must\nDo something themselves\nTo change their government if they don't have their own inside revolutions and take over and become more responsible and that's very difficult for them to do because they're not educated or they don't have the education will don't seem to have that\nWell it's more of a a mentality of being a welfare mentality out wherever they live there they're taken care of so to speak\nAnd they expect that here and we're not a welfare mentality country at least I Hope we're not we may\nBe going in that direction you know we are paying job but what I'm saying is these folks have to take care of their situation in their own country\nAnd we we try we tried in Afghanistan or the Taliban or brutal brutal battle and and that they absolutely brutalized especially women but everybody so [noise]\nReally Saudi Arabia I tend to Saudi Arabia and all of the two countries between Saudi Arabian turkey Saudi Arabia is much better with women than turkey is and I just I just feel\nYou cannot make a judgment on what these countries are doing just between themselves\nI don't know what's going on that's the problem we don't know I suspect I suspect that that they killed him um I don't know though I have no proof I don't have any evidence I don't have anything now they have videos\nOf some private jets landing in Turkey from Saudi Arabia and the two teams of guys coming from two teams have guys going from there to the Saudi embassy and so there ... all the ... this\nWas in a set up how do you know it wasn't propaganda and set in order to get this propaganda sent to the end I well aides and cause a problem\nI don't even know if ... if a Saudi a citizen flies in our private jet I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the Saudi embassy I mean that's that's what people do\nSo I don't know what what uh what how this is going to come out but I don't expect that the that the Saudis are going to say yeah we build them that's not going to hang out\nAnd the Turks are going to be real happy to be able to come up with some kind of evidence you know to destroy the relationship that we've been trying to develop\nWhat they would they would love to you and\nYou know the women in Saudi Arabia have just recently been given the right to drive although that's a real hard cross to bear for their for their culture but the thing is they're moving a little bit forward and did it the thing is is until something breaks\nWithin their culture they are not going to change and you cannot trust any of them anytime anywhere\nYou know and so he breaking the the the brings a break you know all these rules and allowing the religious police have been a been a barely pulled back women are allowed to go to sports stadiums\nUh there's there's yes they're small steps but they're steps in the right direction I presume that the Muslim majority Turks probably aren't real thrilled about\nAll of that going on because they're women are not asking for trouble do\nNot but but they are so abusive towards their women and this is I mean I hate ... as an American woman I was offended by the way they treated women forty years ago that may have changed\nAnd I do have who um did you have to wear a job and all that when you were there\nNo I was a young girl I was only twenty I turned Twenty one and turkey and I was defiant it was during the the women's lib the sixties and\nWe were going to wear pants and do well yeah and I was\nTerrible I I Would go down that with my friends we would just and the language that they spoke to us was very offensive because they didn't like what\nI I Would go down that with my friends lately just that language that they stopped the s very offensive because they didn't like what we were doing that\nThough we were lucky you're lucky that you were not hurt seriously because I mean again I I Know you were young and
