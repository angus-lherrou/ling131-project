Johnson Iraq a welcome back we're talking about what's going on\nOr what happened with the Kavanaugh hearing and I want to I Want to bring you back to um\nThe screeching and the shrieking in the Senate gallery the other day I thought to myself\nThis is the kind of thing you write about in history books right there's a moment when in this solemn Senate when we're voting for one of the most important things you have the vice president I think you have all these assembled senators\nDoing something very very serious our whole democracy is right there this is the tip of the ... ward sort of democracy\nAnd then you have in the gallery a kind of animal lipstick shrieking it was it was deeply unnerving to me it didn't just sound like people screaming it sounded really sort of dark and spiritually dark\nRip really it's it's not something I Would expect to see that is true but said something I Would expect to see in a bad apocalyptic novel sold and a gun\nShow in the Nineteen nineties I mean\nIt it's like bad fiction I Know a lot of people joke that we're living through\nYou know an additional season of house of cards but really I think will feel like we're living to a site for any novel or some other really crazy apocalyptic book because the tiniest things that are happening are so creepy and crazy and you're right ... ... in so far as\nI Would say Ninety percent of the protesters against Kavanaugh or not motivated by how they think he's been he might rule on anti trust\nOr ... or us Citizens United they are shrinking because they think he will take the abortion issue\nOut of the hands of the court and give it to the voters so these people are shrinking against the idea that Americans will be allowed to democratically fold on laws protecting unborn children\nWell I think I so important that this made in the hands of five Ivy League graduates sitting in a row\nI I think that that's exactly right and uh I think that's why this is such a toxic cocktail this whole thing because on the one hand\nYou have people who are so angry that really no matter what you say you you can't appease them and now they've been given this idea that oh\nAh we're appointing a rapist to the Supreme Court which honestly no I don't I don't know how you know I tell you the truth John I become convinced that there are people out there they believe it so with such emotion that it becomes true in their mind they think that\nThere will be chosen to believe it well they show was leave it\nTo ... well okay but that's different from they sincerely believe at like they've examined the evidence you also ... did not have good evidence to believe\nThat Jewish people were form of a ... but so is like tuberculosis he shows to believe it and it it it's that his emotions that fit his ego and he and he braced it all the more strongly\nTo a kind of demonic leap of faith\nBecause there was zero evidence for it and he even formulated that theory of the big lie that was the the bigger his ally the more willing people are to believe it because it entails a leap of faith that like a parody of a leap of faith we make in accepting\nWell I was going to say since we're we're talking about these big ideas what we're talking about right now when somebody demonize is an entire group of\nPeople whether it's white men were white people or Jews or in the past black people\nIt it is in every human heart because we are broken and were sinners apart from God we are sinners this is what we do and so the reason we have the kind of democracy we do is to help us not to do it so our government\nUh really pushes us away from tribalism it's white everybody like my German mother and my ... father can become as American as George Washington because we're a nation that believes in something greater than blood\nAnd soil but we I eat when you push away those Judeo Christian ideas which are at them that the center of the founding of this nation when you push those ideas wait what replaces them\nIs a kind of pagan tribalism it's just a different kind of big and tribalism so they don't see it as tribalism and then they call a being a patriotic American tribal is which is ridiculous but you see this happening now that they are demonizing those with whom they disagree and of course ideas ceased to matter if you don't agree with him and they're not interested in your logic\nYou know I I I wrote a piece at stream dot org which I think you you ... your readers might find find that's called Brett Kavanaugh's prosecutors use that death squads defense\nBrett Kavanaugh's persecuted used the death squad defense and I'm basing this on or a member watching Ted Koppel back in the Nineteen eighties with this uh this\nEl Salvador and guy Rebecca there'll be so [noise] we don't ...\nWidely reported to be in charge of the right wing death squads there that were massacring people because they accused them of being in league with communist guerrillas and or do we saw was questioned by Ted Koppel\nTed Koppel said you know it still doesn't report saying that your the guiding end by the right wing death squads\nWhat do you have to say to that and and as I remember it will be son had had a fight or flight response first these so called right wing death squads did not exist they are mean communists Mitt second they're absolutely necessary to stop the communist third\nI have nothing to do with no ideas in charge them fourth to redirect my first point they do not exist but ... they are absolutely necessary\nLike that's the kind of logic we saw\nFrom the people attacking Kavanaugh are you actually to watch Dianne Feinstein during the questioning she would put up the ... things about the the the so called\nTeenage rape gang Kavanaugh would shoot them down and then she would go back and throw us through another piece of spaghetti at the wall that would fall and then she'll come back to the original one we saw that I mean even people\nWho they were so desperate to stop him\nThat at the end they said okay well maybe there's no evidence whatsoever that that's Kavanaugh salted for it and maybe the Atkins ... apparently accusations of what happened to jail or absolute nonsense\nAnd yeah yeah they were lying about the rape gang but look how upset he was looking his temperament how can you get this this screaming flunk an Irishman and put him on the Supreme Court\nWill like voted him to the point where\nThey were they were accusing them of a bunch of clients he should go to prison for for ten Twenty years and he their absolute lies and he got angry whiteley defending himself and then they accused him of not having the right judicial temperament that's exactly what they did installing a show trials and the nineteenth or in Nineteen twenties and thirties\nAnd the thirties when Stalin put his opponents on trial he was accused of being\nSimultaneously spy for Great Britain Nazi Germany and the Vatican\nAnd then they would point out that we did kill us and self contradictory all these things work and and then they would say you see the cleverness you see the subtlety you see how how twisted his logic is he's so good at covering all this track the very fact that he is making these arguments shows us what an idiot spy he really is\nIt's it's so I mean I think that the only way to cut to the chase is to say that there is

I'm not standing for it and you know what I think the Democrats are not going to take the house I think we're going to win the midterms precisely because we saw this lake kid power grab disguised as concern for victims\nI you know what I grow at once and I also think what I find interesting is that anytime anybody wants to frame thing as the men verses women issue\nThat a failure and I'll say why because every woman has a father a many women have brothers and husbands and sons that they love to death they loved them they adore them and they would want them\nTo get fair\nA fair trial they would want that and so when they see this railroading maybe they they keep quiet about it because uh they don't want to get in the crosshairs of of someone angry in the family\nBut privately they see that when you railroad all men your railroading them too because they love the men around them the men that have black them and and would stand up for them just as I Would my daughter or my mother or my
