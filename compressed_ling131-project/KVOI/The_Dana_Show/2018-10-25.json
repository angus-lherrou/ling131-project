I Know nothing about making bombs nothing so I Am just\n... I I Know nothing about it I'm just reading what I see a lot of veterans and a lot of these bomb just throwing or the other them extra yeah speculation but they say that I'm trying to find actually I'm trying to find the some of what I've seen let me give me a moment and ... there's just a lot here okay so so for instance Tom sour\nWho is a bomb disposal bomb disposal officer former bomb disposal officer says ... proper pipe bombs don't have wires connected to both ends that's dumb it's as you can find timers in remote control receivers way smaller than whatever that white box as a proper timer would best be stored inside the pie making it fully calculated that thing is just silly looking\nHoax devices he says are far more common than real ones in which case we should ask ourselves what are the motives of the bomber and and and the who benefits\nOr he says think people in critically or whoever made that wanted it to be painfully obvious to anyone and everyone that it is a bomb this is nearly the same as a bundle of road flares wrapped together with an old tiny alarm clock ticking away\nSo interesting\n\nI mean that's that's and I I still I'm curious as to whether the other ones look like that one that's why I'm asking I'm ... I'm very curious as to whether they does\nDoes look like the ones from Brennan et cetera\nBecause then I think you can determine whether or not\nYou know this is somebody who's an expert at what they're doing ... is it is it how many different people I mean do you think it's more than one person I kinda wonder\nIt's him ... I mean it could be I mean good grief Ted Kaczynski was one guy it could be and I I also want to caution everyone else to who immediately wants to camp ... Rhonda speculation I heard that I don't know I don't know what you're talking about\nThe remember back when there was the um there were all these bomb threats to Jewish ... after the election and it was this disturbed teenager in Israel and then in twenty fourteen ah you had a scorned spouse trying to find their husband who was sending\nWhat looked like rice and to the White House and chew the mayor's office back in two thousand and fourteen and so it may not necessarily\nBe you know you're there it could be ...\nSomething entirely bizarre or could be outcomes razor or it could not be I mean I'm just there's a lot there to consider show there are a lot of questions to ask I think my biggest concern with all of this right now is whether or not again I don't know anything about making bombs which is\nI'm I'm curious to know\nHow expert laid this looks and how expertly this is going to how I mean if this was slick construction I mean we have one bomb disposal tech who says no because you want to know if you're working with someone who is skilled who knows what they're doing a\nAn or whether or not this is just some don't\nAnd or whether or not this is just some dumb idiot who\nEither trying to act heart or trying to I don't know I mean every I think everything could be on the table right now but you want to basically know whether or not other people are in danger\nSo there you go\nSo far without that nations that doesn't appear to be and it seems like there's a lot of people a lot of authorities involved so looks like we're going to whatever may be still out there which Cuomo flow to bed earlier when he was out there talking about it I'm I'm sure we'll be caught up in this drug methods now\nA centrally out there are people are hyper aware at this moment right right\nWell thanks we we have more to come or a as well and ah will break we'll bring you any other developments and we get hopefully we have a lot of other show for you but ah ... we'll see if we can get to that or not but we'll have the latest in the meantime a kind of get moving on\nAs April critter is a great resource to have a for\nAny business of any size really a because when it comes to hiring their job sites that send you tons of the wrong resumes to sort through and that isn't smart and it's not smart to use relatives to fill in at work while you look for staff\nAnd when it comes to life it's not smart to make the lottery the central piece of your retirement plan\nBut what a smart is going to a zipper critter dot com slash Dana to hire the right person liberal critter doesn't depend on candidates finding you find them for you\nIt's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identifies the people with the right skills education and experience for your job and actively invites them to apply for you get qualified candidates fast\nAre huge Jewish show weekday mornings three to six on ten thirty review\nWhite campfires how about a campfire atmosphere with\nFriends and brought to your ears wherever you are that's where we do in our American story show the ... great American stories along ... before dying money stories about Merce job this day in history American Dreams of marriages so much more than\n... years of your stories on these big topic every weeknight\nWere listed on line in our American network dot org and hope you joined the campfire and call in with your stories\nThis is Dana lash keep it here for more intelligent talk on a an ten thirty ...

Tate is well a Janet is going to tell us she holds the father Michael me giving each year of life ethics at Sacred Heart major seminary in Detroit Janet it almost sounds like you're Catholic\n[laughter] it's just a little just a little bit I think that I Want the dog wants to live within\nA you know what the dogma the dogma does live deeply within you and that's why you're on this program ah I Love it when our lives deeply and people let me ask you a question first of all how do you pronounce humanity take\nI think it it just just swelled there\nI did just swell up because you anyway it's a Latin it's a Latin term um and it is and it's cyclical written by pope Paul is that right\nOh politics\nBut politics okay so this is in the in the sixties\nIn Nineteen sixty eight\nOkay I thought so I remember when pope Paul was on the throne of Peter I was just a kid of course but he\nWrote humanity today and in cyclical for those who don't know is a major document produced a by the pope's and it's it's meant to be taken very seriously it's a very thoughtful it's not a speech or something like that\nAre inhumane he'd be Tate was at the time rather controversial now why was it controversial in Nineteen sixty eight when politics wrote humanity take\n[noise] very good question let me just note that you might be a can of human life\nAnd it was it's written on the church's teaching on the use of contraception in marriage\nOkay now I Want to I Want to say that a v day of course is life it's where we get the word vital vitality vitamin and then of course you many as is human so yeah so this is a a wide ranging\nUm document dealing with obviously would sexuality but specifically with marriage and birth control there many of my fellow evangelicals who don't begin to understand\nThe Catholic teaching on his I happen to agree with the Catholic teaching on this I think what is true is true there's no such thing as Catholic through the Christian truth so tell us what the pope Paul the six say on that subject\nWe know it was controversial at the time but I think because of various um cultural developments but every Christian Church been opposed to contraception up until Nineteen thirty and the anger comes from the sport when the first coup that book with that tradition [noise]\nIn a number of confidence in Nineteen thirty where they decided not on the basis of deep theological study\nOr but on just on again pressure of the culture\nThat spousal within marriage for various serious reasons could use contraception [noise] they were little debate in the Catholic Church about that ... up until the early Nineteen sixties and that was because the ... the invention of the contraceptive pill\nBefore that all the available was um some ill\nFitting forms of a diaphragm and the condom when the pill became available people started to think maybe this wasn't the contraception that would be Congress after that would be um rejected because it didn't put any physical objects in the obstacles in the way of the spouses\nAnd joins sexual intercourse\nUm [noise] but the origins worked on that for a relatively short period of time and said no no no it it it\nViolates the fundamental principle of of that\nWhen it hit to form in constant teaching of all Christian\nSects as much a design not only for but very much designed for procreation and anything that is trying to torture a an ... of the pro creative powers the social act is not an accord with God's will for sexuality alcohol alcohol one of the first man she gave\nWas be fruitful and multiply until the earth so that some people thought there was too\nSo that some people thought there were to fall right and like insects is an still do right I think that uh the most important thing to do was to control the population and that the show is just going to be an awesome tool\nOr to to do that then the UN was starting to develop big programs for\nUm distributing the show in ... in developing countries are under developed countries third world countries so the church was trying to figure out how it could teach teaching in the modern world and that's why it made a new state not there was one in Nineteen thirty one\nIn cyclical by pious the eleventh called 'em on cost cost ... which is on Christian marriages on chased marriages and then in sixty eight a humongous which just suppose reiterating\nWhat had been the constant teaching it he mentioned evangelicals I I have to say that over the years I haven't been invited to many times to evangelical gathering so to speak on this\nBut they're remarkably beautifully receptive I'm to the possibility that contraception is not in accord with God's Brian um they might make a simple argument um which is basically\nA ... ... have this beautiful commitment to a tightening of giving ten percent to God right off the top and I said no God looks babies a whole lot more than he likes money [noise] and and it can look at me and I say you know\nI I Will not seem to have that as many babies as you possibly can have but God loves a beach that's why he he created the whole world was for new human life I had this lovely even joke or might come up to me after one of my talks and she said\nYou know I never knew how to think about this she said we don't have any teaching about this and she said I didn't ... people would say well\nYou know have you have you changed your your white family size and she said I didn't know what that meant [laughter] I I I don't I I think she said we stopped at four she said that we thought that was what she said but I think we would have had more if we thought it was somehow acceptable to have more fresh\nAnd something that's happened in one little thing that happened with the pro life ... of course was evangelicals and Catholics working shoulder to shoulder you and it's been fantastic for for both parties I think that even jail closest covered that Catholics aren't whatever they thought we were um\nMember members of our members of a cult I think is um and my prayers are our term yeah well no I have to say that it it takes a intellectual leadership and in the case of the evangelicals are we have to tip perhaps to Francis\nSchaffer in the Nineteen sixties he was the one who really helped a evangelical Christians\nUnderstand that the Catholics had been
