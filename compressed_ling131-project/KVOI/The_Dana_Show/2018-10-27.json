that was taken into custody he's apparently been living in that van\nFor a period of time because his own family apparently didn't want 'em around\nMaybe they saw something maybe they knew something he has a history about him this isn't the first time his name and explosive device of ever been used in fact it's part of his history\nHe also has a drug charges as well born in New York a resident of Florida which means I I have a feeling we'll be talking more about Caesar when it comes to Florida Man will try to find some funny dumb people but there's nothing funny about this guy at all\nAnd during the FBI press coverage during the department of justice press coverage people want to blame the rhetoric for pushing this guy over the edge when it sounds like he was crazy to begin with\nSo why is this my fault why is the president's fault why is this the media's fault this isn't even your fault folks\nThis guy if he did it this guy\nNeeds to be held responsible we need to read this and

no Michael I'm going to tell you when you if they were just agree with Trump people wouldn't be crazy like this guy which\nI'm not saying that I'm just saying if they get on the same that's actually what you just said\nYeah well I mean with with everything that's going on I mean I Know everybody's going to be going to the point of you know not everybody's going to agree on everything but I mean that's why I left and the right should be should be getting along for everybody else out there that they're representing\nNo no no my am I going to disagree with you I respectfully brother I Love you disagree with you and here's why I'll tell you I appreciate the call or you don't get along just to pacify the masses\n\nBecause then you're hypersensitive ... every stupid threat that's out there and we don't bow to every stupid threat that's out there\nWell as if we don't do this that people are going to be angry and we don't want the people angry so I guess we should provide everything to everyone because they might get angry we don't want them to be angry that's how government got to the size of God\nBecause they keep providing to everybody because they don't want to make them angry they want to make them feel good\n\nThat's how we got to where we are\nDon't get along argue debates\n\nAnd they'll say well what did you know the wife would just agreement jumped they wouldn't have a

compare the two I'd rather that I'd rather than Maxine Waters of the world do that because I don't hear anybody saying you know we ought to do\nWe ought to send people explosive things in the mail and just in them and damage than physically no\nWell absolutely nobody is saying that\n\nAid for for three four four Dana aid for for three four four thirty to sixty two Jeff Indiana you're on the Danish

if you called NPR with that amazing baritone voice you probably scare everybody at and ... this guy who oh it was good there's got to be by business\nThe water's deep Jeff go ahead [laughter]\nAnyway to get to the discussion of today member law I don't remember the media outraged when Republicans were receiving rice and all of that actually put people in the hospital\nAnd you know we did have a guy that's\nYou know what your outrage no fear yes there was an outrage but there was fear I remember\nWhy you remember everybody blaming uh whoever was president at the time\nYou know what was going on or okay see and that's the whole thing with the the main stream media they're such a joke I mean it's just ridiculous and the thing is this guy has to be the worst bomb maker in the world I mean I don't agree with what he did fail glad they didn't go all\nIt is that what it says David given them more and the nation but still\nIt's gotten out of hand on both sides it really have because I just told me about Maxine Waters yeah OK rather have them do that but people have been physically attacked in the street\nNot just run out of a restaurant but somebody some pro life on the other day was actually attacked physically attacked salt\nSo it's just it's getting outrageous on both sides and I agree it's got a difference with somebody you need to provide an argument that's going to win the case about start getting violet or encourage violence or encourage anybody to be told that they they're not want it if they don't fall\nAs as we get back to the substance but be be passionate passionate Jeff do not lose your passion at all I'm all about you know what an already and here's the thing\nIs is housing define us this is even the majority isn't even the only one percent of the population you know this is this is the smallest version of who we are as a country because most most everybody else\nThey they're they're asking each other hey who you're picking Red Sox are Dodgers hey wow well yeah well you know they're they're they're watching the watching football there there is there is is ah is the price of gas going down what's that that's it that's where most everybody is yeah you're here\nThat\nAnyway on here so but my point of view that that this was just ridiculous the media is played it is I haven't seen anything else all of it is for days they're acting like nothing else install\nLike you're saying like they have no other life but the thing that gets the most if they were in this on the president\nSo it's like really\nI mean there are ... they want to act like this was something ... old decided to do\nAnd you know he's he's got his rhetoric upon you know he's a little extreme about it but he says what he thinks he's passionate about it\nAnd people aren't used to that are used the politicians\nIt's just so they want everybody happy and he's done with that they're just saying that what you're always thought they were charm limits for already\nMaxine Waters\nAs far as I Know that she lives in history that she\nRepresents a California was multi million dollar man\nOur these people get mystery it's all a hundred and Seventy a hundred and eighty thousand dollar salary\nYeah but am I going to blame or am I going to blame but people like you voting Rebecca ... and ... and the thing is as much as ... as much as I Would love to control what everybody else does I I Am a very good argument against or moments\nOkay the thing is is we want to tell everybody else who they can and can't away right because\nWe don't want to go you know there are people you know no no no ... well I I I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll go I'll go I'll go just a ... bar here and I I have other things I Want to\nDo in my Dave until somebody else who they should and should not vote for in a district bridal with\nThat that's all that's all I don't live there if they want to elect a moron go ahead like them or up I I I Wonder if the bunny ranch guy is gonna win then is off Nevada you might know him from the HBO thing he's dead you might actually win the election\nSo\nI'd love to tell people who they can to get the thing is is I don't want to be a king man I

Hawkins and I'm an atheist and I say\nYou haven't really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know they geared if nobody's doing it\nA in a way that I'd like where I'm going to do it in a way that are right now you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um\nAnd you you were raised what as as a nominal do ah was was was was your Jewish faith or central to your life in any way was just something that you had privately going on\n\nRead\n\nThe books are you ready hey we're talking to the author\nOf a brand new book called in the mood and say did you have questions about these things and I hope you do I hope you are not stumbling along not asking the important questions about who you are where you came from where you're going uh does life have meaning what about your life does your life have meaning the asking those questions\nAre you come to the right place I'm sitting here in the studio at their conduct show talking Scott Shane his book is in good faith\nQuestioning religion and\nAtheism okay so Scott you um at some point you decided All right I Want to write a book about this this is a big book and you really get into this this is for people I think you really want to know I've written books\nThat deal with a lot of this kind of stuff I wrote a book on miracles I wrote books called everything always wanted to know about God but were afraid to ask that's more than a popular level this really gets into it and this is not to say that this book is difficult to read it's not but it's it's in depth you've been very rigorous ... answering\nA these questions and when did you decide to do this because this is a real work you've got here\nYes well first of all thank you the the the the the reason I decided to write a\nA book that was comprehensive yeah was because the new atheist claim that they're you know\nThat they're being scientific right that if you believe in God you're a dummy right or you're still clinging to your parents superstitions or you're gullible or you haven't yet been educated enough rice\nSo I started out and actually writing a little bit simpler book but as I got into it I said to me I I basically bought I'd better write a book that can stand up to academic in criticism right 'cause\nI ... I have friends who have sent their kids to college who took classes and we took classes in religion came out atheist yeah because they're reading all of these\nUm atheist new atheist screech friend there was nothing that took them on one by one so I read them yeah and there are six sections in the book I distilled what their question I was in some cases I actually think I made the atheist questions sharper that's way westerners both\nWell listen I have to say I have not read uh in in in their entirety any of those books you reference I started to read Christopher Hitchens is God is not good I founded on reasonable I found it so unpleasant\nAnd the arguments so spurious an ad hominem and sloppy that I could not believe people were taking this book seriously I mean this is a guy Christopher Hitchens\nWas so brilliant and so funny when you want it to be an entertaining then he kinda carries you along with the sound of his voice or with the way that he writes but the content was garbage was stunning to me that people were taking him seriously I thought he he doesn't have any actual arguments here it's all just kind of potshots\nBasically absolutely I mean are they spend a lot of time mocking religion but one thing that I realized which is a core part of my book is that what the new atheist really conflate is they don't understand the difference between ... and I ...

order thirty ish million people to march to their death because they believed he had the authority to do so how did Stalin sent tens of millions to the gulag starve a quarter of Ukraine and no one question it I\nMean that's I dollar tree that's not that's that's describing the ... definition in the Bible to a person of course Hitler and but ... pot and we see it in modern ways very similarly where people ascribe to themselves\nIn a small way to make themselves idle right\nWell it's interesting you you mentioned a Hitler Pol Pot or Stalin and Mao and those are all totalitarian atheist regimes now some people might quibble with that but I have the facts to say that they're and they're quite wrong I mean Hitler was\nAs far from a Christian as you can be in fact if you were any kind of a serious Christian\nAh he would sent you to a concentration camp or have you killed him and his he was at war with the serious Christians within the third Reich and we're making the movie of the story burn off and that becomes a central issue is that\nIf you were just going along and saying well I'm not a Jew so I guess I'm a Christian you were not a Christian you were a gentile who might go to church but the actual Christians were at war with him and he with them\nAnd so you have this line running through these ... ... regimes that we're all\nMurderous at their core murderous on a level that we can\nEducation and ironically a religion was not the problem atheism was the problem that was the ideology\nLike ... which is the problem I mean religion if you consider a dollar tree of former religion which I don't write I'd our tree was the problem is a problem it's a problem today it's a problem everywhere and\nWe ignored at our peril and we continue to ignore the apparel I can let me give you one we're talking about murderous regimes let me talk to you just mentioned one we're sitting here in New York in a studio there we used to be a former there was a former attorney general Eric Schneiderman\nWho was um\nYou know at least went by the moniker of Jewish but she um set himself up as the law I mean literally as some of your listeners may know he was deposed because of a whole bunch of a sexual abuse allegations in confirmations\nAnd what he did is he said to his victims I'm the top law enforcement official in New York\nYou can't complain to anybody you have to do what I Want you to do he abused his authority right and it goes back in a small way ... he made himself the gods and when people do that they abuse other people and you know that's not it they don't necessarily murder or other people but they can cause them\nImmense harm and so we have to cleanse I think cleansing is a the cleansing relationships that I\nDollar tree I think is a microwave just to be clear on what I dollars for years I mean I'm\nI Would say worshipping or anything other than the loving creator God of the Bible ends up being I dollar tree because\nUh only he is worthy of being worship now there was only he created the universe only he\nUh uh loves us and lives for us and what you don't know there was anything else that you worship whether it's the state or yourself a lot of atheists\nAre worshipping themselves even though they might not say it but they are so up put off by worshipping God because that impinges on their uh ability to do whatever they like so they have to say there is no God so they end up worshipping themselves anytime you worship anything other than the actual God of the Bible\nUm ... it becomes I dollar tree doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose count it the third commandment most Christians kind of second commandment which is not to take God's name thing than to take a shot in Hebrew\nAnd it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance it says that writing the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... sold spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we see it currently whenever anybody says look believe you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul\nI I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same short of trouble which is how ... the stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the or don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that's that fast and then of course that was the ... the Luther issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize that at the heart that\nHe wasn't really a ... ... all he was doing really was challenging the authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong where we say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized\nTheir goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and you Hadley\nYou've got and that but Luther tried to do when you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion and it's ... that's\nI mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subjective that whenever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nI mean again it depends what the laws of nature are exactly right when he talked about the partying the red sea\nUh [laughter] it's kind of ...

good faith questioning religion an atheism a big book with all kinds of interesting stuff in it\nOr we are talking about miracles so the miracles of the accidents supporting the red sea you say Scott than it has a naturalistic explanation you don't say it's not a miracle but you're saying it's a certain kind of miracles so what do you say happened\nSo I I again I think that's an important distinction that God can act through nature or God can act outside of nature if he's so wishes but in the Bible and the Hebrew scriptures\nThe so called the red sea is called yum soup the regency which sort of changed to read see when it got to the ... and this is why I Love studying in Hebrew because now the ... of\nCourse is the Latin version correct twelve the is is that when St Jerome translated sort of like a three hundred eighty\nA hundred percent correct so the ... was before it right on that or Greek and that actually in many ways is we will would even be a um a cooperative what am about to say OK okay\nOf the translations so they were when I Do on page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this where you have to take the criticism seriously well the red she couldn't apart as well it's actually not the red sea\nIt's there's two lakes that were around at that time right the bottle of lakes and the bitter lakes and if you closely follow\nThe the and I have it on this charge if you closely followed the tracks of the Israel lights including when remember they turn around yeah remember they go for three days and then they turn around and then they end up against some yes some a body of water well it seems like that is um the bottle of lakes and\nAs late as Napoleon\nThere are discussions up armies go in one direction marching the other way and saying whoa we can't go back this way there's water why because they're these lakes do have there are facts from tidal forces there are reads they're essentially very marsh she would never very deep these ...\nLayers mark Napoleon's marching around Egypt a general ...\nAnd uh and they encountered this and so you're saying um okay so you're saying this cooperation so so what are you what are you holding that the that the um as we've heard that that that a wind blew all night and that it was possible a two part it but it's not as dramatic as it was in for example Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston there was nothing like\nThat no I mean unfortunately the ten commandments is not actual video footage of the beer and I know we take it to buy on\nIt's yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against that water rising away to walk maybe it was a little ... maybe it was a little ... but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle that wrote down that\nWay right well see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaoh is army has drowned in the very place where you to\nMost people would say that as a miracle are now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happen but it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well it is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumbles but what you're talking about is fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nA mini believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand is relate males to analyze what the word is it's it's ...\nIt's six hundred thousand in in ... is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back and spent some time and read a number of a philosopher just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible or the ... the tower was waiting without bottles which is makes it hard\nDuring their vows were very rare in those days did very expensive hard to come by and they had they had to do with what they had\nRace correct you know there were words like aloof which could have been which A L F aloof which could have been pronounced the number of different ways and could have meant something very
