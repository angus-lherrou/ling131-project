I think even there of ... yeah well listen I Want to talk a little bit about Halloween because you're kind of an expert on these things are you and I know we talked about it on the program before that um there is something very real uh the demonic realm\nThat a lot of people discount or they think it's funny or they they get scared but they don't really want to deal with it that they don't they don't know that Jesus has power over the dark forces so they kind of\nLet themselves get intimidated by the dark forces are manipulated whether it's in a real way or just in a slight way\nUm but it's real or even a lot of experiences with the dark stuff we talked about that on this program before so what is your general view of of Halloween because you know a lot of Christians don't celebrate it uh but some are as I was saying can take it more lately uh and and redeem it and make a cute thing but what what are your views on it [noise]\nWell I think the first point is to understand that when Constantine they legalize the church and the beginning of the ... century a day and stop the persecution so I was a good thing\nBut then he brought the Roman empire under his leadership to um protect the church and that boomerang because within a couple of generations or the state began to persecute Jews and patients to begin with costs he protected them wanting to protect the church but then a boomerang in the process\nYou know he didn't believe in religious liberty believed than I mean this is what\nThis is what Christians are there was some there were there was no credit for like ... what happens is once once the early church lost ... lost the ability to understand religious political economic liberty\nAs Greek thought came in er which is rooted in slavery when you come right down the leaders in slavery when Greek thought came in and do all this and believe in good and evil were polar opposites as opposed to ... being a the some entirety of good\nAnd evil being finite whereas you our Ellen ... so the infinite good versus a finite evil as the real contrast\nSo what happens is without a good Hebrew foundation with Constantine\nHe wanted to protect the church against persecution freedom from but there was no concept of freedom for so even though he wanted to also protect the biggest and Jews which he did to begin with by employing the church to oversee the council's it nicely and so forth oversee proper doctor and so forth\nBy the time you get to the ... at the end of the fourth century he turns around and begins to use the power of the state to persecute non Christians and therefore and this is we're at the baptism\nI Know I Know you're bringing this back to Frankenstein and ... go ahead\nAnd see what happens is is that when ... comes into the for it's a measure of Roman citizenship [noise] so what happens is that to bring in pagan who did not want to be converted they had the saints replace the gods and goddesses they had Mary replace the queen of having\nWell hang on hang on I ... I Need to translate for that is what you're saying [noise] uh and and and and I know you're going to bring this back to Halloween but that what you're what you're saying is that when\nA Constantine effectively made the Roman empire were not effectively he made the Roman empire old fish ally Christian yes somehow when you when you don't have any concept of religious liberty the power of the state gets much together with the power of the church suddenly\nThe church gets watered down and really opens itself up to all kinds of pagan influences and so what you're saying is that the pantheon of pagan gods somehow gets much together with saints and things of the saints become more than what they're supposed to be the kind of become like the eighties\nHis replacing some simple phase in order to win allegiance to the church of the Roman church if they didn't call themselves the University of tricks at that time that was later but the Roman church OK and under the bishop of Rome so yes they did that and so to fast forward a very much Halloween that's what Halloween as a result of\nSo you have the pagan calendar and the painting counter has certain holidays throughout the year the solstice is a an equinox is then also a ... terms of modern paganism or you have a January first a Groundhog Day May Day and Halloween\nAnd so in each of these four dates\nOr added to the fore I'm a solar lunar dates a you have um\nA focus of energy for their religious rights in practice now what's amazing is religious rights and purr Hagen pagan once okay so they love to celebrate a you know the lowest point in the winter and of course Christmas was brought into that even\nYou know the lowest point of the winter and of course Christmas was brought into that even though are the birth of Jesus was not during the winter and Easter from after a you know taking got us was brought in the past several weeks all these things\nWere compromising language and they reported more to the ... calendar now I don't know I Do know the ... counters very ancient when it comes to celebrating the equinox is and it's also says\nI in terms of the rest of the days of the year I that's more recent though I don't know the exact time table but I Do know that for centuries now Halloween has been a pagan holiday and it's it's meant to sew but it's a reaction to\nThe Anglican calendar and the Roman Catholic calendar of all saints day which is November first and all souls day which was November second\nSo these two dates are celebrating so all Hallows eve is to eat before all saints day so all Hallows eve at a certain point became a pagan festival and perhaps the most famous one right now\nWell I guess uh you didn't answer my question since we're friends I can I can say that you didn't answer my question my question is I mean look first of all I think\nPeople get very hide bound and overly ideological on things like they say Christmas is a pagan holiday and we shouldn't celebrate Christmas and you think hey folks life is short do we really want to die on that hill\nCan't we celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas does it matter if some people aren't Christians and they celebrate Christmas why do we get so hung up on now and I would say the same to some extent of Halloween\nI I Would I Would agree with you in terms of that attitude because I celebrate Christmas okay uh and um and that's mighty big of ya ... well I was happy and they are and and you know Easter even if it doesn't land on the pass over a week the way it should in the eastern orthodox church keeps ... to that\nHowever what I was aiming at was you said my experience okay so this historical backdrop I'm Amazed in my life how many of my experiences in God's presence and demonic assault comport\nWith um the ... calendar and so uh when I had this most incredible and counter face to face with Satan in Nineteen Seventy two it probably was made a a within a day or two so it's one of those pagan holidays\nWhen I saw the living God has a fourteen year old and prep school ... school western Connecticut it was on all things day November first Nineteen sixty seven remembered that\nBecause in prep school we had skipped night the night before we had to resign charter and if you didn't ... you got turned the water they would they didn't tell us in the water but there's so much cutting us but I remember the day after that okay was when I made a prayer to an unknown got and then the next day\nIs when he shut up supernatural which happened to be all saints day in all souls day so from my very own conversion ... what ... what I'm\nSorry I didn't notice when I asked this question is a very interests what\nWhat what happens is that this is my life is important in more ways than I can imagine with\nKnowing ex post facto or after the fact looking at certain things that were consistent with taking counters in terms of demonic attacks and then my very I'm a ... conversion what was it the height of it I wasn't aware of\nAll of that being said can you answer my question my original question this is good backdrop but I'm saying that you now if somebody says to you\nHey ah what do you think following I celebrate Halloween should I not celebrate Halloween I was saying that I have very mixed feelings about it I I\nI think it can be a sweet thing I remember when I was a kid it was a sweet thing you dress up as Charlie Chaplin where Superman or whatever and you go around and you get candy there's nothing wrong with that now people often take these things in dark directions but do we need\nTo have the whole thing over to them and say therefore I won't do it I it seems to me that we can redeem it to some extent\nDo you know the apostle Paul opinion on that\nI probably do but tell me [laughter]\nReceive everything given by God as good and you can celebrate any day of the week you want to you know see the ... that's Corinthians Corinthian software that one day when Romans um uh is uh I well I'm not\nSure okay it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but part one point I think\nIs what he's talking about is in the a pagan city of current\nThe only bushes you had fewer meet with those who first dedicated the animals to pagan gods and goddesses and therefore some Christians on the basis of a weak conscience said no I Will not participate in that because that means that participating in what Paul called the demons and he says the demons are nothing\nAnd the reason there is no formal deem analogy in the Bible is because the Bible chosen for who he is reactive\nTheology and anthropology or proactive this is God is good this is a man woman made in God's good image but the devil\nYou know is is the one in the shadows the whole time and so it happens as in in Jewish a scholarship they don't align the serpent in genesis trade with the devil or because they don't understand the theology as matures beyond that and the apostle John identify\nActually never going to we're going to go to break when we come back I Want to hear the rest of that that's very interesting folks talking to Jon rank and if you haven't given the lines of thinning freedom

of that brilliant name for uncle fester faster a festering moon hey John rank and we're talking about a good we're talking about evil we're talking about scary stuff Halloween\nYou were just making a point of view but before we get to that I Want to make sure people understand that we're doing a contest Donald drain the swamp uh obviously the book is out but if you dress up as Donald the caveman for Halloween and you send us the picture\nOr it doesn't need to be for Halloween it can be for you know over the next week as we this is really a mid term thing right so up to November six were taking a entries if you dress up as Donald the caveman and send us a picture a basically a we're going to send you a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp and the button and he's my caveman\nAnd a sticker he's my caveman so I just want to encourage you to do that we're talking about Halloween\nAnd I'm I'm Talking to Jon recognize John you were talking about a good and evil and how we see these things and you given us the background you said and I want to get this you said that the Hebrew understanding of the serpent in the garden\nOf the Hebrew to Jewish there's a difference with the different the Jewish as the Jews I exile after Babylon by weight so you're talking about so so so modern Jewish scholarship the way they look back\nOkay on on the Hebrew Bible is they don't consider this biblical\nTheir opinion no see but but what happens is the church will take host genesis material and interpret it back in the genesis which is okay but I really believe that all of genesis one or two and three stands on its own terms you don't have to go to search elsewhere to find out what's happening okay but what so\n... I don't know why you would bring up a ... view God I'll\nTell you why they don't believe the serpent is the devil right just it's really the ... is an animal and once you do that you're ... goes to increase the directions\nSo if that's a case where is the presence of evil uh before uh uh the serpent shows up and there are two places or one is with us or ... or a rival to places\nFirst of all injustice one one in the beginning el humor God created it happened to the earth in to one and says in ... when he finished creating that happens in the earth\nAnd then the and I'd be will say in their ... the king James and the host but the hubris ... I'm In all their armies and and and no one likes to talk about the so whenever you see lord almighty in capital letters in the Bible it's really our way of armies and and so many translations of just dumb this down our way of army our way of armies the\nCovenant keeping God you know of of the covenant people of armies against the demons who are behind the nation's false God's that lead to sorcery sacred prostitution child sacrificed this is everywhere throughout the the uh the Hebrew Bible\nSo what happens is what is the origins of it so so the question that has to be asked us what armies are present in the good creation okay and so there you go back to\nWhat happens is the rest of the Bible shows the devil as seeking to kill the messianic line and therefore oh it was in reaction and his number one means to\nDo this is too political evil this is why you see ... nature shown in Isaiah relative I pay a fourteen relative to Babylon and easy kill twenty eight relative to tire both these nations are dedicated to destroying the lineage of the messiah\nAn entire case of inflating the Jews and so what happens is you see all the way through scripture a we act to profile of the devil reacting very rarely do you have a ... or parents maybe four times okay beyond that he's always been a masquerade\nSo what's interesting is sick so I make that observation then recently teaching and translating ingest a three I sought to phenomenal things I only partly seen before\nSo injustice one and the serpent was the practice of Bob living things and he said or the woman that's how everyone translates no and he said anger lead to the woman is the word for anger okay there's no doubt about\nThis I have never heard that in my life you know\nNor have I until I translate it he said a NATO ally to the woman woman\nUp he said angrily to the woman is right there okay what's the word up which is also made an up\nWell if we have fun let me tell you can I take a detour and come back to this ...
