Elizabeth Warren DNA tests suggest she might have ... different to those people can prove that they have the right to be citizens of our Cherokee Nation\nThrough documentation their ancestors were always there\nSo right you know we eat we have some citizens would have no Indian blood we look back at the Friedman\nTheir citizens of the Cherokee Nation\nBecause we adopted them as citizens just like the United states adopted its foreigners places citizens\nWe would never you know they well they don't have American DNA they're in high measure for American DNA it's this thing or for Cherokee citizenship and\nWar and um I think this is probably the most damaging thing she could have done for Indian sovereignty\nAnd and it seems as there was a a a really awesome opportunity that could've prevented presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world\nShe just didn't say you know I had heard stories growing up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that\nAnd and then ... and you know apologize and moved on instead of doubling down and tripling down and then coming out you know with this big grandiose announcement with his DNA tests for doing the video and everything that help nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it is I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in the last twenty four hours because\nIn my mind I understand what Indian identity is where it derives from\nIt doesn't necessarily derived from anything that I get as an individual it comes\nFrom my being as soon as I Love the Cherokee Nation who had treaties with the United states and that's where my right as an Indian comes from it is not individual worn doesn't seem to understand that she and she won't give it up it [noise]\nYeah I don't know I and then a huge distinction and I'm so glad that that you because I I I really enjoy writing and I think that you have a a a very good way of taking anything that seems complicated and making it very easy for people to understand because that's really where the focus is\nAnd in in in you laid it out so incredibly well because it's I mean this is about tribal sovereignty this isn't about race and it's not about identity politics as you just explain\nWhich I I I don't know why that you know aside from uh the secretary of state Mr ... junior there when when he was explaining out on on television last night that was the first I think that that's ever really been put out there\nBesides what you have written in this whole conversation and I I don't think that it's the peer ... peer ... the the the bubble so to speak\nUm because there seem to be I mean I see some of the Warren supporters thinking well you know the DNA tests prove that but as you said that\nThis is it's about tribal sovereignty and ... and it's not about what what you are pushing here which is\nWhich is true what harm does this do 'em for those who don't understand who aren't who you know are just looking at this thirty thousand a foot view what harm does this do in terms of a discussion and recognition of tribal sovereignty and awareness of it in this country\nI I [noise]\nFrom my view or seen some things happen right now that\nAre considering it under the issue of Indian identity there is a tried and Massachusetts who was denied it land in trust status because it did not fit the definition of Indian\nIn Texas a federal judge recently struck down the Indian child welfare act saying that it was based in race\nAnd um it's you know it's not it's based on status I don't care what race you cry it you're not a title citizen it does not apply\nSo we've seen those two things happen and it's alarmed Indian country say you know they're trying to redefine who we are and then immediately right behind those two things Warren comes out with the DNA test as\nIdentity Indian identity and that is concerning\nVery concerning uh especially given I mean there's a reason why and I always say this to to people especially as it is with respect to laws I mean there's a reason why you have certain terminology there's a reason why you have certain recognitions whether it's this or whether it's this or or any other issue as it pertains to law because\nWords words matter especially when you you're talking about you know a sovereign nations and you're talking about recognition of laws and trees et cetera et cetera words matter because the the law regulates it based on what words are used\n... exactly and I I was relieved when I saw the chair casing come out with a statement over this because at this point like you said they have not\nSaid anything against war it in fact there have been times they kind of gave her a pack\nThis time they came out made a statement and it was a pretty strong statement\nBut the key to me\nOn this whole thing is that our leadership and the Cherokee Nation is democratic and I don't mean they vote democratic I mean they're highly involved with the Democratic party so for them to come out and make a statement like that\nIt's stronger than many people realize\nYes very significant very significant and I think that kinda highlights how bad all of this has been um ... and as you said it does it does a real\nDisservice and putting it mildly 'em and can create a lot of complications and as you said you know Senator Warren Zinn attorney does it worry you that that someone who\nI'm for it you know has tried to because I think that there's a difference between saying well you you came from somewhere and then claiming that you are or something and the way that she had presented herself and you've even written and we're talking to twyla Barnes a Cherokee genealogist you've even written ... granddaughter dot com\nHow you know ... whether it's the the rest of the people that she came out with her the story that she was telling about her mom and dad and how they had a low because of her grandparents then you know cetera\nUm I mean it really I mean it it she was trying to claim that she was something which is very different than saying well I came from something\nAnd does it concern you that ... because she's a lawyer as you noted and because she's a senator and she seems to be setting herself up for a bigger race shouldn't she know more about that\nWe would hope she would um\nIt is it's troubling because she she's one theory I don't maybe she does know more about it and she doesn't care at this point what she did yesterday served no purpose other than to try to get a jab at this\nDale purpose other than to try to get a jab at the president of the United states there was no other purpose for that it serves no good purpose she could've ignored\nI mean we've all been insulted all being called ... which we ignore it not most of us ignore it right and she just could not do that\nRight\nYeah and then and then we have and then she I think ... created in even worse controversy\nFor herself a twilight for I appreciate what you do and I appreciate how hard he worked to educate people on on these issues and um and also educate people on recognition of using the proper terminology which is highly important folks you can find twilight ... granddaughter\nDot com twyla Barnes a such a pleasure to have you on the show thank you

couple of minutes Michael junior our to the great David Limbaugh maybe the brother of Russ\nLimbaugh who yeah um yeah you've heard of Rush Limbaugh oh yeah um okay so\n[laughter] but I got I got a Michael junior to laugh he got you'd assign a book for miracles book and he said I'm going to sell us on ... and he laughed and said you know one oddly enough you can get more money on on ... if it's not signed\nYet here so people have said that made him kind of a longer laugh at that although technically it's funny I'm\nHey somebody tweeted the other day on Twitter you know copied me and said that get her when Texas has miracles book signed copy of miracles but kind of ... and I clicked on it takes you the ... and he was selling a signed copy of my miracles book he was and I said this guy's like marketing on Twitter you know to\nHe really is not Larry us yeah ... whatever you want to get more without assigned to pay a guy okay well I got a lot to talk about the fact that my book is launching today\nOr is it really is important to me so I'm very excited about it and I want to remind folks\nOr if you're thinking of getting a coffee or copies for Christmas or whatever if you buy them\nThe week that it comes out which is to say today or tomorrow or it goes to the first week of the ... when they when they put together the best seller lists so\nI I always say to friends do me a favor if you're going to buy the book by it now because it it goes the first week is is the most is the best option for a for us to get\nA on the bestseller list so I just want to say that it's important to me if you're thinking of buying it that you would buy it this week and of course you get the first edition and the first printing 'em I actually think this is going to be a thing I think people are gonna I think next Halloween\nActing with me absolutely as it has happened at times when I'm Talking\nLike pretty serious ... and I'm not getting anything back like I don't know what's going on and you feel like ... because I'm not getting the laughs\nI feel like the audience is now with meat laughter is the only way you can guarantee you're into that they're tracking absolutely the end or there but but you're absolutely right if anything else you really have no way of knowing I mean you could brilliant play and if it's not a comedy you like did they love it do they hate it I don't know\nYou don't know and then you just got some critics have been writing about it like if the people that's\nWhy I like comedy so much you know immediately and you know immediately if you should probably get another job so I get some comedians who asks me questions especially new communities they'll say stuff like how can really make it in comedy and this is my wife said this yesterday on a radio show that was way more fun than this one yeah I'm a ... uh\nI said there's no such thing as a pure stand up comedian there just isn't I mean there's some really really really funny guys but they're but to only to say to yourself I'm going to be a standup comedian only actually a ticket to misery\nWhat I mean by that is is comedy is a vehicle it's not a destination\nBut now now why is that because I'm thinking of people who did comedy grow you know and that was their only thanks so what do you mean by that vehicle to what\nWill a vehicle to something greater than just making people laugh because if you think about some of the great some of the great thing comedy think about the end\nLike what it it looked like at the end I don't worry about that or did they certainly tried to attach themselves to something bigger like one or to want to like a ... of one of the great to know people don't like been sick all in one of the greats anymore was Bill Cosby\nIs no doubt in the world of comedy you one of the greats right Warner grace but towards the end of his career before all that other stuff jumped off\nHe actually started going through communities are mainly black communities and talking to people about how important it is to make sure you're doing the right things he's Seventy something years old as point where you realize like water I Do I just made it most people laugh\nLike like people at at a certain point you start to say wait what even graduate actors you say to yourself what what ... what am I what did I really do I'm sure bankers everybody else is like what did I Do because they have all of this set up and they haven't deliver the ... yeah I\nI like this idea now I got to ask you do you uh who who your influences growing up when you were a kid you not that much younger than me so when you were a kid who are the people that you said I Want to do that I find that that that guy's funny or did you did you get you want to be a comedian what were you thinking as a kid\nWhen I was three years old uh I used to watch you are listening to you on that just in general yeah that's very funny and the ... and um no my role ... it was hard on your throat which is so I thank God I'm younger now ... ... is that your Walker\nLooks that way a second could more practically the same age as you shave your hair off nobody can tell if it's gray yeah yeah that's an that's an Indian trick on or ... years and who were your come on your influence is growing up who were they let me\nJust finish this little comment was in fact in all good you just put your hair on your why do\nI Know I'm very open with my audience this is a this is a a a wealth fitted horse hair wig had commissioned from a weak master I said\nI said money's no object I don't want the finest wig money can buy and he said well that's going to be horse here because course hair holds its value fish from the derby too and I got to meet the ... and it was a very intelligent horse and I said\nI Want that on my head so they kill the horse and if there's a lot of behind it but they said that uh Eric they said this is going to expensive but it's going to hold its value if you want to resell that wing someday probably get most of the money that you pay for it so that's what you're looking at right now we're\nProbably nine seconds passed by joke was a ... you should have jumped in and say hey let's start in ... so what do you what do you know bad jokes and this was going to try to ask you who were your influences so here's what gets really weird about this question in an intimate go ahead and answer so is this is this is where people don't understand so when I first\nStarted doing comedy it was the strangest thing I'm doing comedy and I completely lost my taste for watching comedy\nLike it's a no it was so weird like I Would be on TV trying to watch or I Would be um\nThis one I don't think it's funny it's comedy but then there's these three amazing stories in the middle of the jokes are through the comedy special that has never known it has never been done like this before it ever anywhere\nAnd will never be done again because it's going to fail yeah why you need to go to the theaters or\nAnother way to save ... it's going to Eric is going to Eric ... especially if you could\nTell us that was so cold to say like I thought we used to be friends oh well retiree folks or I or unfortunately I gotta do no segment with this guy so please be come with me folks don't go don't go come back\nAlbum I Want to tell you about real effect over yeah yeah I take it all the time I Know a lot of people take it half the the the media are talking about it but on this program instead of me talking about it how about if we can get somebody else to talk about somebody for example named ...\nOh over the years I got older I dealt with pain in my head and it got worse and worse trying to walk up stairs it was felt miserable that morning I heard of that really factor I
