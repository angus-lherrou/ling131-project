down black people that some bunch of BS um this is what makes me sad you know there's a reason\nWhy what this verdict is so unusual and so unprecedented that this is the first Chicago cops in a half century to be found guilty of murder case in almost a half century\nNow my friend Mays Jackson will say that's because the system is biased against ah the black man I Will say no in Ninety nine percent of our\nPolice shootings they are justified shootings jurors jurors or or judges but our legal system finds in almost every case that he kept shooting somebody even if it's tragic it was a justified shooting and that says you should be\nWe should not be convicting tops for murder left and right of black people or white people\n\nBut this one and I'm not a cop and I will defend cops you know me I'll defend cops are beyond when I have to\nPut this one's just didn't feel right and when you saw a few really watch that video and you saw with officer\nVan Dyke did to this black teenager I don't give a damn ... what he was on I don't give a damn what he had in his hand I don't give a damn a troubled he was you watch the video he was shot\nSixteen times other cops hanging around\nAnd again as a layman he sure didn't seem like he was a threat in that moment to officer Van Dyke it saddens me\nThis saddens me\nLet me hear from you let me go to a Kurt hey my friend Kurt\nRight there on that day all around or your family to track\nAnd I hope the media all kind of come out saying look it's kind of all been avoided if we're not on her or not committing a crime and we pay you off her command that's kind of girl at all like soccer though\nIn American as yeah that's true and the meaning of things are run with it\nOr hate her Kurt any crime on yeah gimme gimme gimme your\nTake from your perspective 'cause you walked in officer Van Dyke shoes um you watch the video the whole case do you think the jury kinda got it right\nThen and her roommate and accept that you're you're\nProbably got it right on that but the media and he'd measured and don't grow that everything has got to be part shocked at the melting\nBut the media and he'd measured and don't throw

give 'em a point of view from someone who has a daughter who's Chicago police officer\nAnd I have to say that this was not a victory today I'm\nWithout having to repeat what everybody's already talked about I'm going to be the voice for a police officer who basically for Fifteen Years that an exemplary job he never once had a fire\nA weapon at anybody and I've heard you and I've heard other people speak about well why didn't he look why didn't he slowed down why did he do that\nMy daughter said it pretty clearly that the first time you have to pull your gone out easier holster yeah it's so split second yeah you can't help but think one I'm here to do my job I'm here to serve and protect not myself only but everybody out yeah\nUm we can say what we want about the victims we can say what we want about Jason Van Dyke but what we did today as we made somebody a sacrificial lamb and we basically tied in the hands of our police department for\nEver and I literally cry today over that\nIn a bad day I uh I so appreciate your perspective and tell your daughter thank you for her service will do thank you Joe okay thank thank you for your thoughts in your opinion I\nI I'm ... I'm sad about it too because\nLook I think the reactions going to be stupid I think the reaction on our side uh I I got all the respect in the world from east Jackson and I I understand that the reaction in uh the black community in Chicago they're going to feel good about this I get that and I understand that um\nBut like like uh the Brett Kavanaugh surfing was not about the me too movement and it's not about all women it was about ... Brett Kavanaugh do this\nOr this officer Jason Van Dyke thing it's not about\nA cop shooting black men and black violence in the city it's about did officer Van Dyke commit murder that's all just this but we want to create and blow out of proportion all of these other mirror image that fit where we are politically\nThis is a sad day for me Kate\nI think a lot of people it's a sad day as well I'm
