stuck with ... who it was it was fascinating to see\nA and MSNBC and other networks tried to spin\nQuestioning why Saudi Arabia would target Jamal ... as as conservatives these were engaging in some sort of whisper smear campaign even though it was in New York Times that had reported just in several days ago\nThat ... was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and it was ... who is aligned with the more extremist members of the royal family and he was against their support of Israel and remaining a very much in support of Palestine have untreated one time a deer America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nAre talking about that Palestinian and Israeli relations\nAnd so there I think that there there's a genuine questions as to what may be not saying that it sanction but what possibly could have you know costs Saudi Arabia and the crown prince to to take this this insane move but\nThe way that the media is handling it trying to somehow a ... is is bizarre to me and at the same time\nI'm there so Steven they're so concerned about Saudi Arabia\nThere they think that it's so bad we need to stop any kind of deal with and they get these are the same people that are very eager to suggest that we must make friends and Renee friends when Irwin over in Turkey\nAnd NATO or the one who is you know I was jokingly saying that he was like the valedictorian of jailing journalists and they're in NATO for crying out loud that seems to be hard to reconcile for them\nLive and you got some pretty much right this is a perfect Middle East story there are no angels turkey is a mess a pro is llamas and this this guy was no saint doesn't mean he deserved to be murder especially the way it sounds like he was murdered ...\nUh bought turkey does not have clean hands when it comes to Islam Islam in the broader Middle East or in dealings with the United states frankly a Saudi Arabia is far from perfect country it's democracy or but\nIt is balancing against Iran and turkey to a degree that have been in favor of the worst of the worst groups\nIn the middle east in recent years or so we've got a bad person who's a lot of journalists he was a commentator a former intel guy that was in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood\nDidn't deserve to be murdered but that's where he was a and usually a media would go up to the mines to try to get true facts on a victim that they didn't sympathize with\nA and it didn't happen in the United states or to the United states the fact that this guy had an affiliation with the Washington Post didn't make this an attack on America was a tack on a on another government's\nSovereign territory consul and so it's it's a perfect Middle East stinky piling mess\nUh and uh I think that just like I said last week I have no more convinced we have a hundred percent of the truth of the Turkish government says they're going to lay out more of their version of the truth\nIf there ever was a tolerance than my disposition for this hour truth and your truth separation that phrase even America it's definitely applicable in the middle east\nYes and and you mentioned as St Louis and more of the story out I've noticed that turkey and Saudi Arabia their stories have diverged greatly\nYeah soccer that would end up with [laughter] warring factions\nAmong the evil people of new world yet and that's all and why we have to come one hundred percent down on one side or the other uh I mean I this is really a time\nWhere I think the administration is correct if they just say let's gather our own facts the best we can and probably will never get to a hundred\nPercent but this is one person or in as bad as this incident was\nThere were four people murdered and then ... and where was any measure of this at that time uh and for everyone that's offended by that reference to that\nIt's you know it's just a fact we had four Americans killed by Islamic rebels and they didn't care necessarily who those people were\nWere who needed to be brought to account\nAnd they fought for years the fed never even happen so why one guy\nWho doesn't even belong to us why does this cause for great shift in American foreign policy and so I just I think to pull back\nThe reins from rushing to judgment on this and we've got a lot of Whittier national interests than this one thing and before where it goes crazy on me I'm not saying it was okay to murder a guy\nIt's right in the grand scheme of what American national interests are in the middle east this is kind of bad guy on bad guy violence I'm not sure I really want us sticking our next too deep into\nIt and it's amazing that the same people worldwide who are up in arms and demand that the United states come down on turkey side on this I'm I'm\nI'm I'm doubtful that these individuals are

okay to do I'm really kind of troubled by that time but it just can't drive what are what our policy is and in a day of\nSavagely rapid social media news cycles we get sucked into these capillaries and just important to step back and look at where our militaries where our weapons of mass destruction where our real movement that can change relations among states\nAnd this ranks up there were some of those countries I'm just not convinced for the United states it does\nWhere are real movement that can change relations among states this ranks up there were some of those countries I'm just not convinced for the United states it does\nAbsolutely a last thing for you obviously I'm sure you can see that the caravan as it wanders up for the western side of Mexico about twelve hundred miles that they have to undertake and uh Mexico originally they were going to stop and make them all try to apply for amnesty but of course that didn't go over very well there have been photos that have been published showing\nSet our allies just sort of standing out on the side of the road watching as the caravan goes through there is even apparently a security vehicle in the front that lighting their way in a ... a as they are they make the track deeper into Mexico\nSo what is this I mean obviously I Know that there are individuals that would love nothing more than the optic of having seven thousand individual there at the at the southern border\nWith a militarized border and use that as a way to fundraise all the way up until twenty twenty without any sort of concern for the actual individuals involved who were standing there and the and the and the dirt [noise] um what\nHow I mean the president said he would he would restrict foreign aid he said he would shut down the border which I fully expect him to do a do you think that they're going to make it all the way to the border the United states southern border and if show is the president right in ... in responding how he says he will respond if they make it there\nSo far I completely agree with him and I see no evidence that this this caravan which is a euphemism if I ever heard one this is a giant ah looking to break American law\nAnd so I don't uh you know I I see no autism Mexico is going to stop them but I'm sure than anyone listening but make no mistake nothing to do\nWith human rights which has nothing to do with ... uh the vast majority of the people going on this long field trip and that's what it is or active uh and the timing is not by accident or and it's really a perversion of our political system

Dr Robert Jeffress on the line doctor Jeffress welcome\nAre good to talk to you Eric thanks for having me\nWell first of all you know when when you write a book like choosing the extraordinary like everybody is longing for meaning in life and I and I think most people they kind of hit a rut I Know I did and you wonder is this shit what ... what am I doing with my life what a why\nAh why am I on this planet a lot of times people even Christians are their face\nA it hasn't really gotten a hold of them and they're kind of just [noise] or maybe their faith has gotten a hold of them but they're still sort of lost and so whenever I see a book like this I kind of get excited because we need to know uh the answered these questions so so what are you saying the book and you say seven secrets for success and significance what do you mean by that\nWell let me tap into what you just said you know so many Christians right now are kind of like the Chicago sewer worker who was asked why he did what he did he said well let me think I did the ditch to earn the money to buy bread to get the strength to dig the ditch\nYou know that a lot of people are living their lives they get up go to work\nCome home and eat dinner watch TV go to bed instructor routine all over again right and I think God really has more force than that and when I talk about the extraordinary life this is not a positive thinking mumbo jumbo book\nI actually based this book on the life of a wide shut up you know a larger the Bible says was an ordinary person a he had the same doubts ballots would disobedience and discouragement that we do and yet got used to and and an extraordinary way and his culture and what I've done is I've I've unveiled the seven\nChoices allied you made in his life that led to an extraordinary life and the you know to sum up an extraordinary life happens when we find are unique life purpose and find how it connects to God's purpose and I used the seven very practical secrets that help has to do just that\nWell it's interesting that you're you're writing about allies or because he he experienced\nGreat uh despondency or in his life I mean whether it was depression or just being just broken at his which end and that has to kind of book came up I think a lot of times people do go through that and they we can always relate to a\nTo him under the broom tree I guess\nThat's right in fact that's one of the chapters of the one of the secrets of an extraordinary life is learning how to handle that day's\nUh we all have bad days are bad seasons of life one discouragement piles upon discouraged but and I noticed the secret is not how to avoid that these were simple people living in a simple world we're going to make some bad choices rap some bad choices made for us we can't\nAvoid bad seasons of life but we can learn how to handle them without allowing them to paralyze us and that's one of those things we look at an ...\nIt's almost funny to think about the day under the broom tree is a bad day I mean it was [laughter] it was very bad it was extremely bad he actually\nBring your your pastor so you know this stuff explained to us what brought him to that place in the relationship with jazz a bell and and that whole thing because we're talking about here right now they're all bad\nIn the ... the high point of his life was on Mount Carmel you know we've been there before ... battle with the\nProfits of bail an Asher a slew the profits and the fire fell down from heaven and then he went into a fun I mean part of it was probably emotional spiritual exhaustion and he lost perspective\nEric and it's interesting you know in one moment he couldn't be phased by eight hundred angry province of bail\nBut in the next moment when he was emotionally depleted all it took was one angry female they chose a bell to come after him and he started running and he ran and ran them as you know he ended up under that tree and said you know lord take my wife\nNow we know we didn't mean that hit he really wanted to die he could have stayed right where he was a joke about what if a complicated them but he lost perspective and I talked about in that chapter he mirrors for us you know what to do\nDuring these bad seasons of life you know we need to take care of ourselves physically my old professor Howard hindered said or sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is take a nap and had an animating did not read the Bible sometimes you just need to take\nYeah and then a main thing that did not read the Bible sometimes you just need to take a nap a you know age remembered the angels brought the case too and that's the first instance of angel fruit cake in the ... [laughter] anyway so he ...\nHimself physically he also a resort himself spiritually there is a great first about king David after he had a particularly bad day and all of the homes of if people were a barn than the people were grumbling about him\nThe Bible says David strengthen himself in the lord we need to know how to strengthen ourselves spiritually and interestingly a God minister to any member mostly a larger was hiding in caves and God said after a period of time it's time to leave the cave and get reconnected to people\nYou know he's a pastor I find this all the time Eric when people are going through a bad season and live they'll say a pastor a hope you understand but we're just won't take some time off from church we're having a hard time right now we just need some time off\nOur friend David Jeremiah says the only person who thinks\nYou ought to take some time off from church when you're going through difficulty is the devil I mean his strategy is to isolate Christians and to attack them so I just a great model on how to handle those bad days that's just one of the secrets we talk about in choosing the extraordinary life\nWell it is it's so important I think a ... especially if we're talking to our fellow Christians to say you can be way too spiritual sometimes and people forget that there's a time to eat and to sleep and to rest and to laugh\nAnd hug or kids or to play ball and and I think sometimes the biggest spiritual battle a comes as you just said because we're depleted and we have neglected those things and some people think maybe there's honor in not\nTaking care of myself the less I sleep more spiritual am I'm a praying or something like that and you think well you better be careful because because God wants us to be arrested and to be refreshed and that really that's such a big once a big one for me I have to say\nYeah and you know we have to remember we're body soul and spirit God created all three components to make us who we are and\nYou know it's a mystery really how all of that inter relates to one another but I Know this you know they were so closely tied to each other you know the body the soul and spirit as somebody said if one catches a cold the other sneezes\n[laughter] I'm not I'm not heard this I think you have to be a preacher to have heard all these chemical thing you just kind of weapon mounted a sermon but I ... I like that and it's it's really true I I find that I have been able to be attacked or spiritually when I have allowed myself to get tired or somehow depleted that I'm more\nI'm a more open uh\nTo to to just falling into whenever a bad place or emotionally or anything like that in sleep a an eating in and laughing and giving ourselves a break sometimes 'cause I Do think sometimes people confuse\nThe walk of face with this kind of testing it out white ... like that that to take care of yourself\nOr is a sin and and I think no on the country that's a ... if the lord loves us he wants to take good care of ourselves take good care of our bodies in our minds and\nAnd that that's just a big one so I just uh I'm Glad that uh we got to that when you're talking about ... broom tree uh it really is funny too because he has just come off of such a high\nAnd isn't that another thing that when when you've been through something fantastic right after that often can be a very very down time and that's the classic case\nAbsolutely perfect illustration and it was also another truth I mean illustrated there that we talk about and that's waiting on God's timing you know a larger had a big splashy came on the same really out of nowhere and first king Seventeen made his big pronouncement the evil King I have it's not going to rain and then got sending off for three and a half years\nIn obscurity and you know a lie to hit really I think thought God was finished with him he spent six months alone by the work carrots and then two years with a widow and yet during that waiting time God taught a larger some in valuable things\nYou know we want to move from one big thing to the next big thing from a big failure to a big success many times God's calls a time out and I say in this chapter waiting all God's timing waiting time doesn't have to be wasted time if we're loaning the lessons God wants us to learn\nAnd then the art in story stands for recognize your unique gifts and

will be probably sound funny to you but I thought I knew from the time I was about five years old when I was going to do\nFrom the time I was five Fifteen I thought I was going to be a TV producer\nWas on TV when I was five and I was so interested in what was going on behind the camera\nI mean I used to go to the library Eric when I was eight or nine my parents were brought me off at the Dallas library to do my homework and instead of doing that I pour pulled down every broadcasting a journal I couldn't read I Would pull down Forbes magazine back issues and read them I mean I was fascinated with the business aspect\nOf broadcasting but when I was Fifteen God spoke to me as clearly as he ever spoke to me and said you're going to be a pastor now\nWhat's interesting is got really didn't change my first and gifted miss he just redirect them toward a new way of serving him and I think again what I Would say the listeners the reason you're interested in the things you're interested in is not by accident\nWe have this idea that God's will must be the most this case for most unpleasant thing we could ever think of like okay I'm going to surrender and go to Africa and live in a hot\nNow you know why people who are missionaries go to Africa or China or wherever and all of his missionary it because that's what they want to do right they would be miserable doing anything else God uses desires and passions and gifts to give us direction\nWe'll let there there's so much in just this now I'm just curious because it's so humorous to me so at age five you said you
