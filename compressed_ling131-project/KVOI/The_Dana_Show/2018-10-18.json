I didn't watch it the ... debuted last night\nWithout Roseanne and like seven minutes into it there and he said oh well she died she died of an opioid overdose and the ratings sink the ratings were not\nGood um they ... they were nothing like what it was on when she was there it went from ten million people to it well it was eight over almost Nineteen million and it was here than ten million that watch last night and here's the thing\nAnd I just go back to what norm McDonald has said well she had treated where it was a regards to Valerie Jarrett was was awful and people I thought this was the first time she's ever treated anything awful you know when she was\nTalking about putting cookies and she dressed up as Hitler and put little gingerbread cookies in the oven that was okay when she said the things that she said about conservatives that was okay and we find yeah but then people got mad when it was Valerie Jarrett\nAnd I'm not saying it and like I said it was bad but it but people I think she's never did anything horrible before she's not a conservative Roseanne is not a conservative that being said I think\nHer show was very different from what she was on line and how she was privately because it was a very real show and it was about very real issues and I think she was able to compartmentalize how over the top she was privately to how she refined her comedy on television\nAnd\nNow I Would as her career done forever\nThe people who worship Roman Polanski\nAnd Woody Allen her career is done forever\nThat's why I don't take Hollywood there blacklist her her seriously because the reason that they they are pretending to be so agree though for what she tweeted his because they think she's a conservative and she's not but there are holding the fact that she won't slam Trump against her as a way to say well no you're really horrible person but yet\nPolanski and Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein all of that stuff Harvey Weinstein was a reluctant casualty of me to do yeah\nThey didn't they only did it after everybody after I got some steam still\nFighting tooth and nail for them um but\nWith the revamping the only thing you can look at it as far as conservative as concerned as she was she was a supporter of Israel\nYeah she's Jewish and she is she's pro business and so really those things kind of a line with Trump and which is really why she even aligned with Trump at all but the left loves to paint her as an entire right wing crazy\nWell they need an avatar they need to justify what they actually believe in our and the thing is is that she apologized and\nThat wasn't good enough why is it that when someone there is no have you noticed that now in society America used to be about the comeback story and it's not anymore America used to love a good comeback story in America doesn't anymore that's a cultural change that's quite significant\nAnd it there's no room for redemption there's too much joy and destruction right now mhm there's no room for redemption\nNo room for and it was just so fake because nothing plays better on the screen and redemptive stories anti heroes et cetera\n\nNo room for redemption at all anymore it's not enough to say you're sorry it's not enough to have a change of heart it's not enough to modify what you think you ... you must be destroyed by people who are the two of them graces foreign you must be destroyed\nAnd grace is foreign you must be destroyed and as a result of that and this is why norm or Donald was right when he talked about this in an interview as a result of that people realize well there's no coming back from ... from an apology\nThere's no coming back from an apology so why apologize\nWhy rectify why even begin to be read them to to be redeemed why it's pointless society is teaching at redemption as non existent and forgiveness is non existent and grace is a joke\nAnd as a result\nIt's making people more polarized\nBecause it takes people think that forgiveness and they think that allowing someone to be redeemed is is is surrender on their part which is show myopic they think that they are surrendering by allowing for someone else to be redeemed\nBut that's not at all you are surrendering but not in a way you think\nIt's making society worse that's just so horrible\nI mean that's\nJust it's it's just awful\nAnd so I I see all of this and and I I it's I don't think and that's why I think that the all the outrage and the agreement\nIs fake because if you're outraged your outrage job or something that is really truly awful and you want it to be made right but people don't care they want to rent they want to stay outraged\nThey've been taught that there is power and being outraged you ... your outrage must be catered to which is why time in the cabin I'll think that was so significant\n\nIt was so incredibly significant because it was as simple no this is what I've always said never been to needed a rage mob you will never satisfy the rage mob the rage mob will move on and find another thing over which to be outraged and it will continue\nOn and on and on the only reason\nThat the outrage mob exist is because the indulgent of a stupid society it's the indulgence of a society that thinks somehow it has to cater to outrage\nStop catering to the mob\nIt isn't a serious entity they're not serious they had no ... there are concerns are specious\nThey commit sometimes worse offenses than the individuals who name often falsely accused and the thing is over which they should be outraged about like the ... the women's march leader being anti Semitic they're not\nThe things they should be outraged about their silent on their inconsistent outraged true outrage require some consistency indignation require some

going to do the one star review right and say I hate you and the presidents of group or or something like you like whatever and ours but I'm In any event or I'm really just ... it's it's look I've set at a hundred times at the humor book\nBut it's also a kids' book I I've I've I've settled in my mind the fact that some people are going to say no it's a kids' book\nAnd it is a kids' book yeah it's just that originally I thought of as a kids' book for adults but on a lot of kids will be reading it and getting it for ... for that it's too it's too is to mention one yeah that's that's sort of like

because I have somebody on the line who thinks about and talks about what's going on in our country all the time she's tough to sum up she has a PHD in psychology\nOr she is she holds two master's degrees she's off in a scene commenting on politics um on TV and her name is Dr Gina loud and and I know her and now you will get to know or if you didn't know before Dr Gina walking with this program\nIs an honor to be with you so much any\nMore congratulations on your book the title is mad politics keeping your sanity in a world gone\nCrazy I don't think they would dispute you that we really are living in bizarre times it's it's it's kind of amazing um what what at the heart of it is is your book about because a lot of folks do you from TV but um they maybe don't know that you just come out with this new book\n[noise] well I tell you what sorts of all the looting and if you I Can't I Can't I think that your book is literally sitting on my coffee table all the time because I Want everyone to intervene it's literally just quite drool over your work now they\nAre you are you talking about my Donald drain the swamp book\n[laughter] the dog outside\nAll ... all that old saying oh is that all thing yeah yeah I picked up at a flea market no I it's kind of funny because I'm Talking to you you and I of\nCourse he talked before we done radio before act on your show I I've written these big books but my new book is called Donald drain the swamp it's a it's a humor book really kind of for kids about a figure named Donald to drain the swamp so I Know that's not what's on your coffee table book but we have to get your address so I can send you you know fresh material so that that ...\nThing\nAnd you know I had I was taught that five yeah congratulations by the way now you\nYou uh I just want people to know when they come your house that not only am I incredibly deep I'm also incredibly shallow I Want them to know that\nJust by looking just by looking at your coffee table to know that I'm an shall look okay well ... you know you're ... you're\nSo kind of a gene that but but the book you've written um what was your idea behind writing it because I'm I guess you're you're seeing that the the insanity and people are a lot of people don't know what to make of it\nUntil a couple of things but that's what I wanted to start doing that they're not the crazy ones and they ask those people you watched across the ocean every day are actually crazy and you are an on and so I Want to choose short people then she'll come to know um [noise]\nYou know I Know in in cars natural habitat here and try\nTo walk and I know in the White House and I know and you know in champagne and and so and I know it's ... and and I feel I Want to comment on his to get an e you think's mind that makes sense in human or anything she'll developments and\nYou know as I look at people in the context of the nation than a contract that human element in the context of their education their birth order and and and\nHe is president as perfectly suited for this I Need a search on your show by it can be quite the person should ever occupied oval\nOffice that no no no go ahead go ahead yeah\nWell I have an actual reality that people are interested in it can stop worrying about whether he's crazy he ... he is just very well suited for such a China's going it's\nFunny you say that honestly because ... the reason I think he resonates with so many people no matter what you think of all the details and whatever and he's not perfect let's face it he does things that I don't like but he has a really\nRemarkable a virtuoso level of common\nSense it's it's really something\nThat is remarkable I mean when I saw him on Leslie stall talking sixty minutes the other day I thought to myself what is so funny is that somebody that I Love like Ronald Reagan I Would never imagine him going toe to toe with hostile journalists like Lesley Stahl he just wouldn't put himself in that position Trump weighed in there\nAnd he goes toe to toe and most of what he says I mean they try to get a B soundbites and things but\nI I listened and I talked to myself this may\nBe soundbites and things but I I listen to talk to myself this man\nHas been given a gift of very deep common sense of the kind of rare\nIn life and when you see somebody has it they usually are really good businessman entrepreneurs or something and of course he is that but to see 'em functioning in the way that he is right now it's it's it's it's come to my mind fascinating because there are plenty people you know this pundits are in the media world\nBut one thing they do not have\nIs common sense they may be brilliant they may have a lot of degrees but they don't have common sense and so it's kind of funny to see this guy with his commonsense on full display\nA constantly but it's just interesting to me that the comments on it because you're in a position with a PHD in psychology to talk about that into to assess it right\nTo marry you make\nPersonality type um actually my back the\nPersonality type that if you're just saying what am I correct type indicator in my opinion it gets quite hear not ever got to watch out for him although I'm going to ask him for that I'm an extra damn but I Am I but I just in an talk once you've done a lot of that sort of a testament\nTo attract people you know on the on the outside and that is the okay with my book am I now is it because the truth about it but you know if you look in your family birth order this is where it gets really interesting and I won't\nGo choo choo deep fried rice wheat but it is fascinating and interesting quirk daughter um called\nFirst and last in the double birth order and and he happened to have enough faith\n... like if you have the right heart is birth order to have both character trait first born invading the baby we all know children we all know the baby of family here it's a fight but he has five children like I I mean it really easy for them and try to take a look at that\nMaybe they need nearly that confident thinks everyone wants them can't understand why anyone wouldn't want them to carry a lot of times with that personality types you also maybe a little bit in the ... the rest of my ability that a lot of siblings do everything for them is\nThat if there's a large space between them and their older siblings that older sibling and younger so that the younger sibling as well that that gets by because they said\nThat while\nOrder so they become a natural leader which is great and Gary is closed today and energy and and total optimism that they'd shots they can pretty much do anything and usually they can't because they were born with us leadership qualities because they had a younger sibling it at all but it's possible for so\nIt's an amazing preparation personality type on top of that and it isn't it that you know I think the rating don't make you very uniquely qualified for such a tiny and you know with the niche you you mentioned Ronald Reagan in of course he was always my favorite president prior to this but I don't think we need to compare president\nNow but you live in the last ... conservative movement wars going in for I\nJust watched her to come in to wake up it's hard to come our party that was way too much for consultants and way too much deference chew immediately and all the rest of it right and this president you\nNeed to do this I don't know that as you mentioned that Ronald Reagan could have done what does\nIt at doing right now and the need is president right now\nOh there's no doubt about that I find it for some reason I find the whole thing hilarious when I say all areas when I really mean\nSo delightful that I have to break out in laughter there's
