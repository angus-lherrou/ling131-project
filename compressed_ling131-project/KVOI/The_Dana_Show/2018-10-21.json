was the world's largest population\nHe wanted to ensure that China and Russia were not friendlier to each other and each was to us given the Soviet Union was much stronger than China at the time 'cause singer recorded Beijing\nWe forgot Kissinger is wisdom during the Obama administration's coddling of China and play nice with Russia just began with a clearly disastrous appeasement of rushing conventional and cyber aggressions and this led to the demonization of Russian President Clinton as an anti democratic authoritarian hey like was ever anything but a tyrant\nCrazy Russia is just a matter of the re absorb Crimea LeBron's ... Eastern Europe cause trouble in Ukraine terrified Western Europe return to the middle east ever a forty year high at us and hacked into us electoral and political and his two sons\nAnd there's no doubt about any of this under Obama American leadership rationalize that China which do not only just be an Asian and Pacific superpower but eventually would eclipse our nation\nIn appears if they thought that China's rise to eventual supremacy was destiny rather than being due to incompetent U.S foreign policy what\nFollowed was systematic and unchecked Chinese commercial and intellectual property cheating\nBeijing stole us technology ran up huge trade surpluses and worked the entire world trading system\nThis one side of Chinese trade war was excused as reach right China's military aggression in the south China Sea with also blown off by Washington so the Chinese built artificial bases on this Bradley islands bully their neighbors and to a ...
