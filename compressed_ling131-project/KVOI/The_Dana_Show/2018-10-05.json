come and I think I've carried out what I promised immediately that we will I have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair and thorough process and I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we\nThe men in Iran about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder Dr Ford I read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the forum she wanted an intern we provide the same forum\nFor Kavanaugh but what I've been dealing with since July the town the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby\nAnd where they just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo hopefully we're forty eight hours away from having a new person on the spring for\nA certain endorse everything that's uh the chairman of the committee as a said like I'm disappointed in my democratic colleagues for what they're doing\nThere's no excuse for a but they're doing it I'm grateful to the FBI for their efforts and doing a thorough very important investigation\nMany of us have said that of judge Kavanaugh dead what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI we have nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him\nAnd we need to confirm him right away\nThis confirmation will be a victory for the Senate isn't institutions are reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been treated yes it's an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried and upset about about ... a Republican getting this seat 'cause they thought they had won the election\nBut that isn't the case\nIn our side has handled this I think with discretion\nHaving every problem that has come up for and frankly I Hope we

if that's the new normal I don't know who would want to serve and frankly I think people would be justified and losing any respect\nFor the Senate than the way it conducted itself during the confirmation process so Moore is at stake than just this nomination and the Supreme Court the Senate itself is on trial here\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be an endorsement of the mishandling of this confirmation process because of hiding relevant information that could have been examined on a bipartisan basis in a way that respected doctor forge requests for privacy\nAnd um gotten to the bottom of this as we've attempted to do now with twenty million people watching on television\nA vote against judge Kavanaugh tomorrow will be a confirmation vote for abusing the confirmation process and a good person\nAnd it will be a vote for this shameful intimidation tactics that had been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign\nI agree that the FBI investigation the now they've talked to a total of a hundred and fifty different people or through the seven background investigations that judge Kavanaugh has been through since Nineteen Ninety three or\n... operation\nNo confirmation of any of these outrageous accusations that have been made against him\nUnfortunately this could have all been avoided um most of the embarrassment to Dr Ford and in the public circus like atmosphere if we adjust the ranking member had just made the allegations known\nIn the regular process and could have been investigated as I said in a way that would have protected her and her confidentiality\nI've said before and I say it again I Believe that we should and we did tree Dr Ford the same way I Would want my daughters are my wife or my mother treated under similar circumstances but we have to remember\nThat judge Kavanaugh's entitled to a fair process to and he has not been subjected to a fair process anything butts so now's the time to quit all of these antics these high jinx the circus like atmosphere and will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nAnd Saturday when we vote to finally confirmed or this good man did this important position\nFor\n\nThe process of reviewing the FBI reports that we received this morning a has been exhausted and it has been a collaborative process with my colleagues a it occurred in a classified environment because these are documents that were not allowed to return to disclose to the public\nUh but because we can review them and only one place we review them together and we stopped and we talked about each point made to make sure that we understood or the message from each interview in each report ah\nAlthough that part of it by operation of law is not allowed to be public I Want to give you their sure as we treated these documents just as we treated each and every allegation without no seriousness with a desire to do nothing more than search for the truth\nAnd just as we've spent hours upon hours hearing testimony in an open a hearings before the public we've also spent hours upon hours reviewing these documents in a classified environments\nAllegations of sexual misconduct are serious of sexual assault or of a most serious nature and always have to be treated with up most seriousness may have been in this case\nAgain this is someone who's been through seven background investigations in the course of the last three decades with over a hundred and fifty people interview with regard to him this is a man of outstanding character who has lived in ...\nOr to him this is a man of outstanding character who has lived an exemplary life he and his family has been subjected to a lot of question a lot of embarrassment a lot of humiliation in recent weeks\nThat\nHas been a difficult part of this process for him but in the process of doing that he's proven his character and his willingness to be candid with the public and ... even sharing facts that are at times so uncomfortable\nI'm convinced of this man's character of his truthfulness of his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court of the United states I wholeheartedly support his confirmation and look forward to voting for him in the coming hours\n\nWell of agree with everything my colleagues have said I\nAlso want to say that Dr Ford I firmly believe experienced a traumatic event in her life\nI just also believe that there is no evidence that we've seen\nThrough the FBI background checks through the time that we've spent and they're hearing 'em to substantiate that these claims are properly alleged and directed towards judge Kavanaugh\nThousands of pages in that briefing room Mike or senator lay in our in that room together for an hour we break for an hour than we

I I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many uh kids were in your family just Russian I\nJust you and Russell yeah [laughter] and I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart are you to have you now this is the ... have you always been two years apart yes it's amazing\nYou see that's very rare it is that's very very rare fluids silly latest ... it was just the two boys you're ... you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and\nUh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday oh yeah yeah we were raised in Methodist Church in what in what a part of the state what part of the country or southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nKnow live\nThat is great he\nRene not to be confused with\nThe great Keith Richards a who's had many blood transfusions at fifty thousand dollars a pop but we can't get into that now 'cause I'm sitting here with the brother of Rush Limbaugh David Limbaugh but your book is just a beautiful book\nFor many reasons but the title a Jesus is risen that is you you realize that that title alone is a kind of spiritual warfare when you declare Jesus has risen\nThe demons tremble that's a fact uh the subtitle is Paul in the early church the demons do not Trumbull at the subtitle but uh but it's just so great that you're writing all of these books but I Want to get back to your story because I Love the idea\nThat you're very rationally you're a lawyer and he got the point in life we for some reason and and listen let's be honest it was probably your wife's prayers for you because she knew that\nIf you did not become a Christian she was in session for having married you so she had to prove that somehow she knew by remote word of knowledge that you'd be a Christian otherwise she's in trouble right\nAnd we wouldn't raise our kids in an overall Christian home what right\nWe do not exactly a good thing so ... says she's praying for you and I suspect strongly actually that that's part of the reason\nYou're you're a thoughts began to focus as they did although who knows right off but I just love the fact that you dug into this to see if it's really true but you live in a culture and I live in a culture where unless you're hanging out with Jesus freaks you believe this stuff\nMost people are very happy floating along they don't even say they're seekers they're not seekers they're floating along I think kind of\nWanting it not to be true because uh it it might their lives might have to change or something like that\nLike there's no question about it that are intellectual doubts\nAre sometimes masks for other issues that we have in our life whether it's wanting to continue to sin I'm not talking about major sin murdering people or something what drinking too much whatever uh that that you whatever lifestyle you want to engage in\nA ... so it might be a deterrent and you and it might be a deceitful thing where you think this is intellectual now there are some intellectual issues\nBut I don't think that's ultimately what keeps people from believing I I think Christianity is based on solid evidence overwhelming evidence actually and and it's based in reason\nBut faith and read and and so faith and reason are compatible but they're not the same thing and you you ultimately take a leap of faith was just a matter of the will but in my case I had to overcome my so called intellectual obstacles before I Would allow myself to take that step\nBut but fate by its own definition require something more than just the uh the rational thought you can't argue someone into the kingdom because it is a matter of the will and some people are are are predisposed to dispose against it or their mindset is against this war all these things and that\nYou can argue with the what you can discuss things with them you can show them how they're some of their doubts are not grounded in reason right uh and that we have affirmative evidence to show how Christianity makes more sense than anything else but you can't openly get them to take the leap\nI think it's interesting because I I Would say a lot of people say you know faith is a leap in the dark and I I've always disagreed with that I've said faith is a leap in the light because good when you're leaving something that is actually true it's like saying [noise] I don't know this one plus one equals to thing I just I'm not convinced and it's like\nIt doesn't matter whether you're convinced it is true so when you leap\nTo grab onto one plus one equals to you're grabbing something that is true and not to grab onto it is really to be foolish but the point is that even something as simple as one plus one equals two on some level\nRequires an act of the will to accept it and and to accept said I've always said I'm\nAnybody knows I mean I've written a book on miracles but the ultimate miracle is conversion why because there is no way a human being can come to believe\nIn the God of the Bible apart from the grace of God you know he's kind of like Lazarus is a rotting corps he didn't do anything to sit up\nGod did it All right and so it's not like we're sick and we're in in need of all of a little medicine to feel better we're corpses in need of resurrection and and face is just like that when somebody goes from not believing to believing\nSomehow got has to be involved and that's this is the huge mystery so you're right I mean I've done the same thing I've written books them apologetic since ... you're trying to help people along because it's not like it's not important but at the end of the day it's prayer\nAnd it's God and so that they're to me that's the mystery you know like why did this happen to you when it happened 'cause you could have just kept drifting\nNo question but when you look back and when you remember that people live\nA a friend of a friend who was visiting a ... from his law school my friend and he both with law school in Texas they were visiting over Christmas I was um we went to my friends'\nParents um started talking and randomly Christianity came up that wouldn't come up and my ordinary conversation and Steve Springer my friend's friend who was with him as a cool guy coop guys aren't Christmas especially not then there are a lot of them now right but in why if we would have been caught dead at those nerdy think excuse me what is in way of\nMethodist youth foundation or what they do something like that yeah maybe that's not what it is I didn't even knowing that I Know what it was whatever it is was on cool man yeah and it's so ... so\nA Steve start talking about it\nAnd I'm kind of making fun of it in a non non smarter way but I wasn't very journal\nHe's he's a cool guy all the girls loving Christian Girls that can't be but but now he goes into his\nBedroom and his where he was staying at his friends my friends' parents and brings back a Bible in any started showing me reference by how and I know if I'd ever seen around his Bible I didn't ... know to write showing how\nOld Testament passages are tied the New Testament how New Testament an Old Testament are internally integrated I'm going to tell you a light went off right there and uh he also was very patient with me uh in in ... and told me about Jesus in his lab and everything\nI kind of filed that then later Twenty years later I'm maybe ten years later or whatever it was he came back to visit my friend Peter\nTender and I said bring him over he came to my house\nI he I was a Christian then I went to my library got the Bible that he'd given me came back and the guy got really emotionally couldn't believe that I that that had such an impact on I'm telling you without that pivotal piece I may not have become a Christian I'm not saying it was random by the way I think it was super intended by God corps but\nI think it moved in so much you wanted to talk about it in his church back in Texas a and ask my permission if you could give his testimony and talk about that\n[noise] I Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening this is not for other people is this for you at the the true where it's not and if it's true\nBy the way it can only blessed you there are people I think they have this fear is comparison me it's going to make me live that\nThat is absolute garbage I Want to date that clearly that is garbage if you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into a weird person if you want to be ... percent but honestly if you want to be who you are supposed to be if if you want to get to your grave\nUh always wondering who am I really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank cars and go anywhere without gas on the tank and I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you\nTo say honestly the idea that this is scary and some white is a total lie\n... and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradox isn't in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the books\nBut I think some some of this pre Christian had this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regimented the robotic they don't they don't live a robust life\nAnd if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't want to hang around with not cause you Baskins them enjoy just 'cause they're they're not happy people some of the kind that I'm not so there are a bunch\nOf well I I Know I can give you named after the show\nOkay [laughter] but but what I didn't understand until later and I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives your liberty Paul talks about immigration it
