E. T. to eight seven to two to let's go back to a W. R. Hawkins\nAWOL let me switch gears with you quickly and take over to Kavanaugh here you've written about this and you wrote about\nThe uh recent or I guess I should say the latest retribution Paul\nI talk with Alan Gottlieb about this in the previous hour and I opened up my entire segment discussing this that gun owners we've witnessed this level of attack because they've been hitting us like this for years demonizing us you know destroying us you know the politics of personal destruction as gun owners they have help from the mainstream media\nWhat do you think\nFrom the same gun prohibition is\nThat have been attacking us what they did to Kavanaugh let me get your assessment on this what do you think is going on here and we think is going to happen\nOr ride on them I Want to say real quick to add to your order statement I'm wearing a uh Greta a\nPAX sure in in a cross\nBreed snatch ... they're saying ... man that host or is on real I mean I Know it is said it just comfortable it's phenomenal I sort of throw that out on Kavanaugh what I think all the years that the last understands and by the left I should say the Democrats\nThe Democrats understand that a catalog gets on\nIt so\nThat's it and and for those who voted for Trump when Trump said look if you put me in and you pick judges who was a shame the second amendment I'm going to take judges who are going to be in line with the light judge or a Antonin Scalia when he made a statement\nA lot of people said ha ha yeah I'll do that well guess what exactly where to go that exactly where you don't have enough and that's why the Democrats are digging in the cause of course it was one\nWhere at quarter for right now if Kavanaugh get then we're five to four for the next Twenty years after four with adjuster who is pro God given right in other words a justice who thinks alike Thomas Jefferson thought\nGeorge Washington thought James Madison thought\nOn and on I can go and of course the Democrats don't want anybody who thinks like our founders stop because our founders to them more than that\nThe Democrats of course are paid their animal I have not that that I think on this type of channel that's the only word back ... years those dollar worried that they're paying their animals or even\nAnd so they oppose anyone who thinks like our founders but that's really what to say this this is not only that John\nIt's about the right to free speech about like the freedom of religion it's got the right to crowded property it's wise to be a secure and I personally have papers in effect it's about every why that is a new ... in the bill of rights the heat and do not want a judge in there's going to guarantee those right\nAnd that's why they oppose Kevin\nYou know it's interesting watching some of the hearings and we've discussed as before I Know you're a big fan of the federalist papers as I Am there was discussion about whether or not the second amendment included\nIn the in the bill of rights because it was like brushing their teeth every ... it's just something they did they didn't feel they had to put it in the constitution it was discussed\nIn those terms and it was interesting when Kavanaugh said you went to his calendars okay well he was looking at his calendar and he said you know he said I also brush my teeth I don't put brushing my teeth on my calendar or going to church because they're automatic I just do it\nAnd it was the same thing with the second amendment when it was being debated before it was ratified in December of Seventeen Ninety One so I think there's I mean the parallels do go back that far when you're talking about what's happening here so I ask you the same question I asked\nI asked Alan Gottlieb the you would never believe if you just parachuted in and looked at Diane Feinstein I knew nothing about her oh look at that nice old lady you would never know that that nice old lady singlehandedly\nDestroyed and she had help but she was the one that started she had the information destroyed this man's wife did it intentionally because of political ideology did not catch that when I say that right\nYou did it right you did write it anybody who doesn't believe that our founders salt rate fabulous eighty four federal agents for is an argument for why the second amendment was needed\nBecause it was a given it was so well known that Americans would ever writes keep barrel ... guy getting right curious like people want to understand that read fabulous eighty four are beyond that as you say yeah well Feinstein is a he's in first class\nAnd she has destroyed this man's life let's say\nThe thing is this\nIn the public is rarely grass the fact that politics how\nAnd if you have politics law that I mean if you have an office you have power the public is ... ... are rarely grass that Democrats understand it fully understand that our lives that Donald Trump very few other people very few other people have called on that summer catching on\nSome are catching up very few\nSome are catching on some are catching on but very few and so that's that's why it's hard even for some Republicans to understand why I don't think she could be that name what you're made that Kelly been operating for thirty or forty ... that's right\nAnd they understand politics is cars so until we wake up and understand that and are willing to play that way\nWill keep losing oil at least loose a fight every now and we have to at some point understand folks a Supreme Court justice is our\nGet that through your head it's power at Trump past the gold push this man is stand behind it you have that goal to supporting\nI Can't say it any better than you're absolutely correct as gun owners we've been watching this for Thirty years as you've said we've seen how they play pool we're getting ready to go to a break the music starts in about Fifteen seconds let me ask you this question has Lindsey Graham woke\nThen he then he goes all pro gun control and that's where we are now so here's what I say he's tired with Morsi Patrick Morsi and mentioned are tired in the poll\nThe only way match and it's going to pull away from Morsi is to show his pro gun Bonaparte\nThere's one more to do that right now it's developed or cap and all\nThat smoke for Kevin ... ... what do you think about it when I think about how\nDoes that actually does that flakes Blake's a fluctuation that method that's all I Want to say it's match and won't cross we didn't care if like goats you're not matter\nWhat about somebody like past or we're not hearing a lot about pastor testers under a lot of pressure in Montana\nRight well here's the problem not a problem but\nFrom what I gather and mark that gathering a in a source of the U.S but it\nIt seems that test or has some people people fooled there and uh and it had been hit them I don't know that in Montana Trump had the amount of forty as West Virginia you have to remember it I Know you know West Virginia you used to be a pure pure Democrats like yesterday\nIt was like in Turkey liking tacky\nThose are the states you would compare and both pet flip somewhere post Clinton the Republicans are going to win that sixty but roughly Seventy percent of the vote on a national election those two states split completely and I'm proud of Kentucky that my home state God Bless\nThe land of milk and honey west Virginia is just like the bank you know wants to keep their affection\nHe's gonna have to sport cabinet he's gonna have to and if he does it\nGot to be the best day of my life when he gets voted out\nYeah you know southern Ohio chill coffee you've got the Kentucky northern Kentucky bordering in that area of West Virginia over there that would that coincides with the abandonment of the coal industry by the Democrat Party and that's clearly where that ship was in Trump is firmly\nHold that into conservative camp and you're right about mansion that just disappoints me there are a lot of listeners in Montana and a couple of new stations as well you really disappoints me Montanans that that tester stays in there you know we're we're talking one particular vote here but again it's it's interesting to talk about are we now know Murkowski\nIs in trouble because of Kavanaugh some\nBars let me ask you something how many how many channels do you have in Montana\nI've every major city\nBut you're in Montana and you're listening I don't know what you're thinking about voting for John tester I really don't but Jon Tester stood with Diane Feinstein after the\nJune twelfth twenty sixteen Orlando ... and ... and he supported expanding\nBackground checks to cover the terror watch list as prohibited bars now here's the problem\nThe guy who attacked the Orlando Paul's what's not on the terror watch list he was just on muscle hated people but the no one will state the truth because the political correct so even if the terror watch list were in place mark even if it were part of the pros edition against gun part she says\nIt would not stop the Orlando shooting so tester is just another gimmick and if I live in Montana it would be my pride and joy my pride and joy\nTo vote for Rosendale over tester\nYeah Montana you're listening right now in every major city in Montana and I hope you take heated that that that's a state we talked about for fun last week on the Daily Show I don't understand some of the\nSome of the politics and play out there when I think of Montana hey W are picked the to the break I think of rugged individual is the one I think on than I think of the Old West man I think a dirty boots the range\nOf good long gone like a Winchester model Ninety four horseback\nAnd I and I think that's what I think when I think the Montana none of that rings Democrat\nIn my book I don't get it Montana come out help us out here we need some we need some help here what's part time to get rid of tester Trump told you that at a rally you're going to see him in the very near future when we come back we're going to continue this fantastic conversation with a W are Hawkins\nFrom Breitbart News you've got so much to write about I think what we're going to do

this morning ah because they were going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh and get Kevin on the committee and they announced this morning that you know what we're going to move it back to a twelve thirty central time\nOkay fine show uh in the morning later on in the morning a Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia he announces that he's going to support\nBrett Kavanaugh he's going to vote for ... capital that's a big deal that's great that's a Democrat and then at about noon today Arizona Senator Jeff flake announced sent out a statement\nI think it I had a problem and I didn't know how to deal with it I heard about trinity so I called and talked to a counselor in half an hour we worked out a plan now I've got one easy monthly payment a lower interest rate and I'm getting out of debt\nIf you're in an endless cycle of paying on credit card balances that never seemed to go away and get ready for a toll free number and we'll put you on a path to financial recovery\nCommunity

this is a I I this is good news and we got a lot of people on conservative talk radio and Fox News complained and\nMaybe we can it beyond ... us two weeks three weeks or three months moment stop\nStop\nAnd I want you to look at it like this and I've changed my mind on this I've changed my mind on this now I wouldn't have changed my mind on this a week ago or two weeks ago or three weeks ago but after yesterday\nAfter yesterday I Want to take away no one card the Democrats have left\nAss B. I. investigation it's all they asked for yesterday so call their bluff give it to them\n\nAgain let me be let me be really tough here and let me cut right to the core\nOkay\n[noise] so Donald Trump today under pressure or ordered an FBI investigation to look at current incredible charges it's not supposed to last more than a week\nOkay here's the deal this is why I think this is a really good thing I Want Kevin ... on the Supreme Court\nBut more importantly I Want his name cleared I Won his reputation restored if he gets on the Supreme Court without this he he might be early when but he will be for ever tarnished\n\nI don't want that I Want him to be independent and strong and have a great reputation to get on the Supreme Court\nOkay she'll give the Democrats what they want to give them one more week give them this magical FBI investigation that they've been clamoring for for days give it to him\nHere's the deal if the FBI comes back with nothing that's it [laughter] Democrats don't have another card to play that's it\nAnd and then when you vote on Kavanaugh\nMan he's in a much stronger position he'll get more votes and you know what because the Democrats have placed so much stock\nOn this thing called an FBI investigation they've made it out to be the be all end all and it's the FBI investigation then pretty much clears Kavanaugh then then the men his reputation is back\nHis name has been cleared\n\nHere's the deal let's be straight if the FBI conducts investigation in three or four or five days and finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been ...\nWell uh I don't want to get Kevin on the Supreme Court if he's the mind about this you know the FBI is either going to find something really damning about Brett Kavanaugh in which case he's been lying about all this or\nThey're basically not going to be able to find anything more that the Senate and everybody else has found which means\nThat's it he's been cleared\n\n[noise] [noise] I I think this is the best thing in the world\nThat could happen to Brett Kavanaugh as much as a show\nWe got to wait another week yeah you know what we do you do because it's that important right now this man has been flown I on the street his reputation is in tatters\nIf he's innocent and I know most of all of us think he's innocent will then doggone it get his reputation back let me go to mark and mark you're on what you\nWant to hear us off the shore and we're going to go there no fault\nOf their problem\nHere for a lot of voters by other more but\nThat's just awful\nAnd mark thank you thank you know look guys like Schumer in Durban\nThank you thank you know look guys like Schumer in Durban they're not most of the Democrats are voting for Kavanaugh no matter what and it's got nothing to do with Dr Blasey Ford but you've got about eight or so red state Democrats who are on the fence\nWho really are on the fence for political reasons\nYou gives the Democrats this final thing they want give me the FBI investigation the final stamp of approval if you give them it and the FBI gives their stamp of approval to Bob Brett Kavanaugh\nWill then these eight red state Democrats like mansion in West Virginia and Donnelly in Indiana they're probably going to end up voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nHe'll probably after this FBI investigation assuming right that ... rates him he'll probably get sixty or more votes in the Senate his reputation will have been back\nHis name will be cleared\nAnd he'll be in a much stronger position\n\nAs a smart thing to do politically at this point after yesterday\nAnd it's the right thing to do\nAnd by the way and if you're on the line stay on the line um come and do all the this is what we're talking about again the day\nYou believe Brett Kavanaugh's innocent well what what's the three to four day FBI investigation going to get a threatened you with that if he's innocent [noise]\nI'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere [noise]\n[noise]\nTime to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying about Joe [noise]\nDick Durbin\nBut and this has been ideal and that I think there should be an investigation of the investigation needs to be at the Democratic members of the house Judiciary Committee\n\nI think this is pretty simple and and I think a lot of the conservative TV and radio folk out there who've been crying and moaning about this all day today they're missing the boat\nThere missed this is too important\nIf you really want this man on the Supreme Court\nLet's do it the right way [noise]\nLet's do it the right way I'm Joe Walsh don't go anywhere

put him in the strongest position we can put him in and let's let's let's let him get his good name back okay that should be our goal and don't give a damn would any of these senators are doing and the whole process by the way on the FBI investigation\nIt's not a criminal investigation\nThere is no grand jury\nOr the FBI can't subpoena records or force anyone to testify they are going to interview the main actors here and as many witnesses as they can\nAnd remember this what if the FBI conducts the three to four day investigation and they find out that Dr Blasey Ford perjured herself who knows a time you're on man\nHey Joe is good\nTalking with you you too I get it I understand yeah you can discernment Democrat but there's always something else that's going to fall on the sleeve\nAnd I'm just curious what is going to be the next the late tactic and like Charlie Brown yeah I'd probably go kick the ball and he told the fall away that's what they do\nIt Tom you're right in your right to be concerned what's going to be the next car that the Democrats have to play there isn't going to be one I guess that's the point I'm making this is it this is that they were screaming for two things\nThey were screaming for Dr Ford to be heard she was hurt and they've been screaming from day one too\nAnd they've been screaming from day one to reopen the FBI investigation that's it\nThis is their decision what they've been asking for\nShow there's nothing else you know what I think the spineless Republicans in the Senate and the house I can guarantee you\nThat this is it after this FBI investigation to Democrats will not have one more delay tactic to play and again assuming Brett Kavanaugh is innocent or this will put him in such a stronger\nPosition let me go to a manual hey manual\nHarjo um\nYeah I agree with it wouldn't be a good thing\nIf it was just restricted to the you know misfortune allegations but my understanding is that there are um go to the foreign allegations plus any other credible allegations over the next couple of days well\nBuddy Emanuel let me let me just correct to your right man you're right let me just correct you it's\nAny current or credible allegations show current means as of now so there are only two other allegations and if you think like me that these other allegations are a bunch of BS the FBI will sniff that out in a nanosecond\nOkay and now how 'bout any little ones in the next couple of days nope nope done current incredible current as of right oh I think credible current and\nThat's it yeah thank you but you

it was struggling along and then\nSomething happens something happen something happening before you knew it\nA Jeff Flake said oh we need a one week delay or we need an FBI investigation a few other Republicans joined him and before you knew what Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate requested from the White House and FBI investigation and before you knew it\nLate this afternoon the president ordered an FBI investigation limited in scope\nThe planned the anticipation is no more than a week limited to looking into current and credible charges\nShould take three to four days and

her allegation is not\nCredible that's what the FBI will say\nYou when we talk about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas in Clarence Thomas's reputation if if George H W. Bush hadn't uh\nIf if George H W. Bush hadn't uh ordered that three to four day FBI uh FBI investigation uh Clarence Thomas probably most certainly wouldn't have been nominated\nAnd without that investigation\nAnd the twenty two witnesses and all of that stuff remember there were twenty two witnesses that the Senate that testified in front of the Senate during the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas thing without all of that\nAre Clarence Thomas his reputation would have been enough then he needed that FBI investigation it actually helped him a let me go to Tom tom you're on with Joe Walsh\nShow are you doing rather questions for sure quick what are we doing another accuser comes out like Wednesday and then we get that added up\nOkay ... let me answer that one first right now the investigation has a limited scope it can only investigate current incredible charges so no future charges are allegations\nOkay can I add one thing I was just down the hill yeah ever cats already is complaining that third that it's going to be limited scope and time so this is already blowing up\nLetter letter letter of complaint will see Joe hey brother smell letter complain again\nI could be wrong call me Nancy naive if you want I could be wrong\nBut I I must say one more time the Republicans in the Senate on\nTheir own can confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nThey don't need one Democrat vote\nTo confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nThe Republicans in the Senate the ones who are kind of squishy flake Murkowski and Collins\nThis is what they've asked for I gearing cheese you\nDon't guarantee anything in politics forget that I guarantee you\nAfter the FBI investigation assuming there's nothing there I guarantee you flake Murkowski and Collins are going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh it does\nNot matter what the Democrats do when this FBI investigation comes in in three days four days five days six days\nAlways assuming there's nothing there there'll be a vote within a day and and and we don't need any Democrat votes\nOr let me go to
