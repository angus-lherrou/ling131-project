for less money and no hidden fees\nThey're pretty ruthless bugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that was a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nWell that and the and that would make sense for the New York times had a piece I just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post said it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know show these friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he very much expressed up anti western sentiments and he was a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted in the charm offensive\nBy the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors after you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you was whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of um a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS there's no more real reformers than to show the is according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago ... was writing about how the caliphate\nIs real the Muslim Brotherhood should be a given time to evolve in the bottom line it's\nA majority of credit of approach to the ... you will and that's not a liberal democracy and I have to tell you I did my five cats so that'll air this weekend on the show gave a reform this is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they are lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or violating human rights of people that are American residents or alone and I thought what the Saudis should do if they really want the recount pants for what they did that this man\nReleased raise better we relieve release the ... the attorney that has been in jail for defending raped but we we have called for the release of tons of prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia who or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islam is lobby in Washington\nOr got assassinated and now all of a sudden they care what the Yemenis who were being massacred by the Saudis now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the Saudis went for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this is just ... I mean the reality is is that\nWe should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balance against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now than between the ministers of foreign affairs in Syria in Iran and turkey that are cheering on ah the the decrease in the civility between the American and Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence of previous presidents silence and all of these dissidents and\nI and individuals that you named who are wrongly imprisoned or they haven't really said anything about them the or the the previous administration silence of it\nBut at this ... and ... those are all the same people that were attacked everyone else that wanted to end that safe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologies for Iran and I see them seizing and exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nAbsolutely and that's the whole thing if you look at the the Ben Rhodes or a you know\nFriends are what are they doing they're trying to find any way possible to resurrect on Obama legacy that wasn't the votes\nFeeding a terrorist state Iran that was feeding a genocide in Syria and elsewhere to sort of resurrect stumped type of semblance of of rationality wish there wasn't any does the Obama carry approach and now if you see

when in fact Carey was smiling with\nWith dictators tyrants in Iran and to Ron in Egypt and elsewhere and nobody can say anything about that and it's just that in the yard to double standard as to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on in the name of sort of revisionist history because all they're worried about is the Democratic party's legacy under Obama rather than actually the real values and and here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed\nThing that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I sit on my pod cast if I was to disappear tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics would continue to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become lying eyes of somebody and lie about them after they die when in fact you're just honoring their entire service in disguise writings was anti Israel anti western\nHe was not part of the secular liberal democratic movement of the middle east is just the light\nYeah last question for you Dr Jasper and we're talking to doctors Energizer here on them where we appreciate your time\nSo I mean obviously we we can't have allies or or or anyone with whom we are associated\nBehaving like that we don't want them to behave in a way where they're killing people in broad daylight and they really don't seem to worry about the repercussions of it how should the administration handled this with Saudi Arabia so asked cannot destabilize that relationship and then give Iran a leg up in ... and and further empower them\nI think we do a little more than we did for example to the Russians when they use the chemical weapon and assassinated individual in the u._k. we basically tell them number one we put sanctions against some other wealthiest individuals in Saudi Arabia so that we have them pay a price where it hurts which is in the oil industry\nNumber two we demand that they're released prisoners that we know we've been asking for their release Canada just had a conflagration with their foreign minister and the Saudis where they ask for rape better we will lead ... release\nThat you know what if you guys really didn't mean to do this then released these other prisoners so that you can at least show that you're heading towards some liberalization\nAnd third I think we hold them accountable with transparency into the future about not only human rights but of a thing you know what we're going to stop doing the operations in Yemen are there are some American planes being used there I think we sell them that's enough stopped doing you know that we're not going to tolerate that anymore and that would be the third part of it\nRight now doctors any jazz are always such a pleasure to talk with you I appreciate your expertise on this end for bringing

even a simple sensor can cost thousands when you're protected by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or the dealership fix your car it's your choice\nOr where and when he says ah look we'll put the military on the border\nIf necessary and and I talked with the then candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this uh and then the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing and right after\nSome punch over his game came across into the United states and killed a bunch of families are age that general Pershing down or they get they put military in this new thing go National Guard a and I asked the the\n... a political nonpartisan congressional Research Service\nFor report on that and they said we can't say for sure but\nIn essence a probably Seventy five thousand that US military National Guard were put on our border\nI could've been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and then pushing let some actually into Mexico chasing the bad guys but you know what when he put the military on the border nobody\nNobody came in and we did not want to come in\nAnd uh you know they this president knows that and he's willing to do what's necessary that not only protect America but it protects others who might be tempted did\nTake a caravan and lose their lives are being raped or be subjected to sex trafficking human ... uh it it's the best thing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump is\nGoing to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I eat when I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get say they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if he earned you I mean you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people got their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past ah with Obama a they would let people like that come through\nKnowing that when they ... they say you got through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it\nIn the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through Mexico and then get into the United states you don't they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because you're right here and there are\nSome states from Honduras or El Salvador or while the ... of Guatemala and say\nI Need to claim asylum but so is my country\nWas jak right a legitimate this subject to the poverty but says that's in Africa [noise] but uh just say I was being tortured or ... well if that's true and you made it a silo from your Central American country\nThen you should have claimed that in the next\nCountry who came to her [noise] so right he got to the United states you already come through so you could attack claimed the style of there so he legitimately cannot claim asylum in the United states 'cause you could have stayed in Mexico without being persecuted so\nNo I was so angry when I tell ya\nI just thought to this point I just thought video that is just a that is the like little video clips that are being released a bit by that and there was this standoff end on the Guatemalan side right at the Mexican gate and apparently\nThe caravan is on video breaking through all of the security forces and Guatemala had while right there in front of that a bridge and they broke through the fence and they got into Mexico\nI had not seen that are not seeing that bullets they're claiming asylum they need to stop right there Mexico and claim ignorance and then let's see what a ... co does for them uh but if they wave them on\nThe ILO President Trump and he is serious about cutting all financial aid and that if we have to close the southern border that that would drive Mexico crazy but we got\nTo start asserting our sovereignty and the United states before our enemies or take advantage of what Obama did add just overwhelm us we can't keep doing that\nYeah yeah and I'm I'm looking at that video starting to make its way around on social media as well 'cause the previous that you know I thought it was just people sort of being deterred from doing some of the security for us\nBut now they play a nurse and they're All right yeah for all that I hear of um um ah it\nIt being all women and children 'cause that's what you hear from a lot of advocates for amnesty they fail it's only women and children while I'm I'm In all the pictures and I've seen a lot of men in their\nYep yep\nAnd and uh that's also true that when we were being ... just women and children well it turns out so they were more men as they were ... this was claiming refugee status you know omit yeah women and children fleeting well\nOr a man and they were sold her age and we had no business bringing them clear to the United states when with regard to refugees from the middle east or as President Trump or\nWe could we could help twelve refugees if we left them there and just sent some money to help them for every one that came to the United states so no matter even if you're just cold and callous\nWhich were not and you look at it from a financial standpoint we're better off or you know send them money and keeping them more than they are where we can help more people but with regard to hunt your assert any of these other countries including Mexico\nIf they are going to violate our sovereignty to that extent than we cannot be sending them money to help them continue to harm our country and our sovereignty or they destroy our sovereignty that there is no\nCountry that people can lead to a we have got to preserve that and at that\nAnd uh we got to preserve that is that it's just\nIt's been three weeks ago I was talking to the former president of Hungary and he said you know we've always look to\nThe United states is truly being that light on the hill that would be pushing for fairness and that we could try to emulate but they should you know ...\n... a registration a you quit but he ... and we need you back up there and I think that's what President Trump is trying to do what you can ... your ... in order to preserve the inspiration for other country\nYeah and and and your country has has every right to determine who or or who can or cannot enter within its sovereign borders every other country on planet earth has that has that\nRight afforded to it as a sovereign entity and for whatever reason there are entities and other individuals and countries that don't believe that the United states has that same right

against the teaching some it\nOkay so they want to sue you they did to you and Matt Sharp what happens at that point\nWell unfortunately or as we might expect the actually the civil rights commission and and all the way through the Colorado court system they ruled against jak ah they found that despite the fact that Jack serves everyone and even this couple here he'd gladly would have served him uh you know off the shelf items cookies cupcakes but\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation\nAnd so we took it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court and we're glad to see in a a strong decision a seven to decision that the court said Colorado you are demonstrating hostility towards ... elite\nUm how you've been forced is what you said about his beliefs all show that he wasn't getting a fair shake and and the state was targeting him because of his beliefs about marriage and that is in permissible under our constitution\nWell it's an amazing thing first of all I think it needs to be set against all Americans need to understand that we're living in crazy times I mean somebody might just say you know what Jack I got to be honest I totally disagree with you I think you're wrong\nIt's another thing to say you're illegal what you're doing is a crime and you're going to pay and we're going to sue you and you're going to pay and then to have the state agree and say yeah you have no right to have this point of view because I I just want to be perfectly clear\nPeople listening to this program you don't need to agree with me or with Jack you don't have to agree with us\nIt's one thing to say I disagree it's another thing to say\nI disagree so strongly I think you are doing something criminal and you need to pay through the nose you need to suffer for this this is not OK and the state says yeah we agree this is criminal\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just be honest not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views\nI mean look people like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy\nBut you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their view is whether you think it's crazy or do you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up whether it's great lawyers and say we're gonna have to go to court and this goes all the way the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nAnd so it was argued December yeah go ahead go ahead Jack\nGo ahead no you go ahead okay it was like nobody I Know in December the fifth December the fess okay it's\nTwo thousand Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC its root for Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts\nAnd it was a failure to let's be clear with a seven to two decision seven to two okay now there's a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices agreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battle it still has to be argued argued and argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the weight Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp\nIn legal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and it's um\nBest part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding our whole person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right

Talking jak\nSill ups of the masterpiece cake shop in ah Lakewood, Colorado jak is that right that I said at Lakewood, Colorado that's correct\nAll right and I'm also talking to a to match sharp as with the lines defending freedom and so you guys are facing yet another battle that somebody has come to you and said okay you're not done we're gonna make you fight again you we want you to make a transition cake\nWhich almost sounds like a joke like it sounds like is this real transition cake I when I heard that I thought\nThis is just um it's just extraordinary somebody's you know sort of playing head games it's like a ... let's see if we can get ... to make a transition cake\nOr and now you have to go back to court effectively don't you\nYesterday with allies for freedom is right back to help us again the shots is what are the best lawyers I Know [laughter] so that juries are going to be working with is hopefully we'll get to straighten out to start [noise]\nFloats well now ... where do you see this going I mean uh what is the next step who ... what's the first battle\nYeah so it's kind of two two phases one we've got to\nThat same civil rights commission that the Supreme Court ruled against it is demanding a hearing on this um and so I think it's ... scheduled sometime in February but we're working with jak were going on the off chance on that since we've actually\nFiled a lawsuit against uh the civil rights commission and the state as essentially trying to put a stop to this that enough is enough\nJak has already been in the six years we've got a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThe state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of this is asking the federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over to the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating a shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is kicked design\nYeah how much bacon you getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court it's kind of nuts\nYeah a lot enough food to still keep busy\nRight um my goodness I just uh it it is that a cat\nThat's a short time oh somebody watching the door okay so in a joint I\nDo have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll night or everybody should read it\nGosh that's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is and so what we're describing here religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty to rarest thing\nAre really never had it in a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um the thank you for I'm\nReferencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick that says we just said you did not pick is and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined\nA and we have to stand up and fight so now is Matt and let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so it it's happening in parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all of the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this\nUm said that jak doesn't have to be attracted to same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is it can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but it's not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "20"}
