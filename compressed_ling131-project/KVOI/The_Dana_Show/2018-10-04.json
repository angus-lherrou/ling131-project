that McConnell was ambushed at the airport I read um\nThat this isn't a couple of different places on line he was reportedly ambushed at the airport by a protesters I don't know I guess they're going I mean he was he went through who's going to the Reagan National airport and ah they were yelling at him as he was going through the airport\nIt's not a particularly large airport either and then and then you had just do what was it yesterday yeah Ted Cruz who was sent white powder or India Harris had his office broken into and he\nWas assaulted and then you had a uh the Pentagon were sent some information as well or within a novel of stuff yeah and then the White House got the White House as well were sent stuff representative Andy Harris dad ah ah\nPeople outside his office and they

that were shot up by a crazy Bernie\nBro and ... was nearly killed\nPeople are losing their minds there's an inability\nBecause of the way that the media has covered stuff that predates Trump there's an inability to coexist peacefully with people who think differently with you and I only see it coming from one side\nThere's a new study out from uh Michigan State university they measured polarization and they said that the political divide in America is worse than it's ever been\nEver\nYou said that the head of the study said that polarization was still pretty strong in the seventies but it's been it's been the chicken or rancor is known in the nineties and up but it's so it's so incredibly tribal you can't even have a conversation\nWith anybody social media is just it's almost unusable anymore\nIt's almost ... I mean it's just almost unusable\nBecause people are are show tribal no one wants to believe anything\nNothing they just that's all they just it's only for their side that's it\nAnd the media really ushered this and and so for Joe Scarborough to say well the media is helping Trump to divide the media divided along with Democrat politicians who could not get anyone in line and then they act indignant when people on the right speakers viciously as some of the people on the left\n\nRealize we're this division came from it predates this administration that's why you got this administration Scarborough in and saying what he said here shows he has no idea what the hell's going on for somebody who hosts the talk show on MSNBC he is completely clueless as to what\nIs happening he does not have his finger on the pulse of anything while you know the media is hoping Trump to divide you got Trump because the media divided genius\nI think support the new to the the media survives because of division ... the only reason the headline quick well into this oh wait for him in the audio\nWere Koppel Ted Koppel as a hit out of Brian seltzer yeah listen to listen to Ted Koppel and are up against CNN ... well not up against but he had some words of honesty actually for Brian shelter listen to this\nMommy mommy mommy mommy Donald Trump has been a really good for baseball [noise]\nWho's been wonderful for the industry your boss or no was it was much number of the ... to the food on the ... it was ... was more of those old shows her nose to the shoulders of sugar in it\nFor me in the

a\nFriend seltzer did not like it but it's true I'm not a big fan of Ted Koppel although I like his voice that's of he was on the news and I was a kid and I remember that voice at five or six o'clock in the news but\nHe is it's true the reason that the media does it is because they they that's how they make they get there and more eyeballs they can charge more than advertising this is it\nThis is all about money and ratings to them\nThat is about the extent of their investment division pays it's a it's an industry that's why you have all of his little groups that are that specifically exist to help from the division that's why you have people who are who are bused in to create tension in in different cities\nDivision pay peace doesn't and people are getting played and they're going right into it\nAll these people that sit here a bitch and moan about while these Russian boss or trying to cause division yeah sociable leftist party and you know how the right the right doesn't do that you want to know why 'cause they're too damn cheap\nI mean it's a fault because they don't spend on good political ads and they don't spend on messaging and they don't understand the importance of arts and entertainment in terms of message distribution although some of them understood it just too late there too cheap to do the crap that socialist and progressive do\nThat's why progressive have all these um teen frilly little groups out there the\nRight has maybe a couple there are a few groups on the right that are bankrolled by uh you know the the bigger wealthier folks right\nEverybody else it's it's it's small donation or it's just the orange the exit Americans for prosperity was the biggest one\nNow I'm a less how many do you have you got all the tide foundation groups you got the newest incarnation of acorn you have\nOh my gosh all over the lines were democracy all of this Blumenthal or I'm Sorry Bloomberg just gave Democrats twenty million\nAh well no that's not even that he's giving Democrats twenty million dollars\nA that's just an increase in the eighty million dollars he has already pledged pledged a total of one hundred million dollars\nThat's just on Democrat races that doesn't touch the millions upon millions that he has spent in a number of states\nLike I'm a number of states like Pennsylvania states like Nevada\nA Washington and elsewhere where and he has tried to export New York style gun control and progressive policies into those states and so that that one hundred million that he's pledged and that was the ... that was a twenty million dollars that he just dumped\nA that is in addition to the millions of dollars that he's already spent on all of those are importing all of those other gun control and progressive issues to other states now\nHe wants to buy the presidency and he considers himself a moderate who he wants to be short listed for twenty twenty\nBut he's not a moderate he doesn't really have that much of a spine he's just a rich kid who spends daddy's money that's what he does\nBut this ... and ... and ... and it adds to this tribalism I mean just look at his groups for just a moment like particularly his gun control groups they always say that they're for gun sense but these individuals haven't done anything\nThey the only thing that they do is try to shame law abiding gun owners particularly women they have a particular affinity for women and they hire these in very insecure people that attack\nFemale gun owners or whether it looks I've seen that before I've had the heads of his mom's demand the head of his mind if they mean girls day the head of his mom's demand um what's her face the chick from Indiana who used to work with um\nDemand um what's her face the chick from Indiana who used to work with um\nI'm\nA Monsanto does she watch lady is total like why are you so obsessed with me completely obsessed with tweets about me every single day\nTries to cut down my appearance tries to go after my kids she says horrible things about my family oh my gosh she's like upset that she said horrible things about my kids and that's like the professional that he's hired\nThat's but that's that's that that's what he spends his money on you want to talk about what finance division well that right there that's about division\nI mean when you hire people to specifically go after people family and say mean things about their family and head out of their kids and say and make fun of their parents like constantly mocked their appearance constantly make fun of how they look\nWhat the hell does that have to do with politics and be isn't that part of the division that just Scarborough says that well you know that's it they're they're helping ... make it\nHow are they helping from division\nThey're making the division everyone else is simply remarking on it and whenever you were a mark up on the division that progressives are creating they think that that evidence of you know creating division because you're remarking on the division that they're creating you see how it makes no sense it's insane\nThese people we have a Florida Man on the way and so we are going to get into that you know

of ... things and you go to where it's crowded if you live here you don't do that but anyway uh I I Want to ask you about to mark and mark is a big day and I and we only have a few minutes but I'm excited to to tell the world about this I'll let you do it\nYeah uh bring your Bible to school or something we started the four years ago this is the fifth year and we started the first year eight thousand students participated\nLast year over five hundred thousand students participate in this year we hope seven hundred and fifty thousand will participate and it's real simple concept it allows and encourages\nA elementary school junior high and high school leaving college kids to bring their Bible to school and to share it with their friends at free time anytime other than class time\nIt's completely legal for kids to talk about the Bible bringing the Bible read the book a job at lunch all those things will be happening tomorrow or in the tens if not hundreds of thousands well\nI Love this idea this is exactly the kind of thing that I think we need to be doing\nMore of a fellow I congratulate you Jim\nOn this we need to understand that first of all uh the ability to do this is legal guaranteed by the constitution\nAnd the idea and people have a very false idea of the separation of church and state they they kind of think that means I Can't live my faith out in the public sphere that is absolutely not true and I suspect it's one of the reasons behind this idea of bringing your Bible to school tomorrow\nWell it is and if you think about it one of the problems we have in our free country is that we don't exercise these muscles one is religious expression and when we don't exercise that freedom it atrophy and I think that's one of the great things about this is encouraging kids who are Christians\nTo go to school and bring their Bible and what happens ultimately Eric is that school administrators are teachers will come to that Thirteen fourteen year old little girl or a boy and say wait a minute you can't have that on your desk it's illegal\nAnd they'll pull out of one sheet that's been prepared for us by alliance defending freedom ATF illegal group\nAnd it's a one sheet that that says no students absolutely have this constitutional right in typically that school administrator that teacher will read that and the students can download it at the website or bring your Bible dot org\nAnd they'll read that and say oh okay it looks like you're trying to do that but the fact that our school administrators and teachers don't even understand these rights as a little breathtaking that may\nWell ah it's breathtaking in its disturbing and only if we do\nThis tomorrow or are we helping them understand it and I think you know it's very tempting uh when somebody comes over and says you can't hold that you can't have that Bible here in class to beat them about the head with the with the book itself\n\n\nThey love the show as promised yesterday Tuesday today Wednesday\nI Would be continuing the conversation with a great judge can store he has a new book out called contempt a memoir\nOf the Clinton investigation and he's on the line right now judge Ken Starr welcome back\nAt areas so good to be back with you thank you\nWell I I really think it's a monumental thing that you've written this book and it rises\nTo the level of history because you were there are only you could tell the story the way you tell it or in this book it's like Churchill writing about World War two you you were a a very central figure a central figure as you can be without being Bill Clinton\nUh and and you really um I mean I think you owe that to history to put down your version of events I'm I'm so glad you found the time to do this what in here will we read a that we might find surprising\n[noise] one of the most surprising things is to people who took all my work you came close to see the indictment of Hillary Clinton\nCooper's stunned by that because the popular narrative the corrosive culture is a a many supporters to this day is this is just about a failing deal at Arkansas nobody got hurt etcetera as there was nothing ... after\nTrying to find something there where there was nothing beers than delved into the ... so that's the that's the meta narrative\nCompletely wrong and knowingly false fourteen criminal convictions that ark and all I Hope that I Would be out there are six months I didn't want the job but in the ... so the job but\nI was asked by the three judge court to do the job but in the fullness of time\nThe Lewinsky phase of the investigation\nThe Nineteen Ninety eight before the grand jury's life expired in Little Rock we sat around the table in Washington D. C. and we carefully reviewed a draft indictment very thoroughly thriller of Hillary Rodham Clinton which was supported by very detailed elaborate\nProsecution memorandum we call it a ... and then we had a thorough discussion and what we concluded was why\nWe believe she had committed crimes in the Little Rock face of the investigation\nThat we simply did not have admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she had committed those federal crops now that's a great protection for we the people prosecutors should not bring indictments unless they can who what it is a luxury\nSo the book with ... some very interesting episodes a clue to the destruction of documents\nThat Madison guaranteed savings and loan which in fact so court the\nClintons financially and the white water investment which was ill ill fated it did in fact lose money but the question was worth funds being used for Madison guarantees savings alone federally insured but collapse with the cost of sixteen million dollars to the American taxpayer\nWas that the financing of whitewater which James and Susan McDougal names from the past and bill and Hillary Clinton were the four partners with their federal crimes in connection with that long we believe that there was we simply could not find the documentation\nTo prove the Clintons knowledge other we had I Witness testimony but does this sound familiar to you Kevin always you know the I ... this testimony was not supportive right by other evidence documentary oh that was\nWell I guess this kind of um underscores my feeling about the Clintons is that they were so used to power and that they were corrupted by it in other words if you're very very smart or in a place like Arkansas you can get away with stuff\nAnd it seems that they did ended it began a pattern um which I think made them cynical toward a the populace that that when you treat people that way when you think of them as\nThey maybe they're there for you you're not there for them um it's it's it's a very unhealthy weight to start public life and it did become a pattern\nThat kid and one of the things that I think helps unraveled the mystery of what makes Hillary check\nA comeback to bill but she was very influence on was standing her having grown up as a conservative a traditional mid west or to household she goes off to college as a less of this or you send your sons or daughters to Baylor\n[laughter] but she goes off to Wellesley obviously it without the academic institution but there she comes under the intellectual spell ... people I tell the story\nRules for radicals and she did\nI tell the story rules for radicals and she did her senior honor's thesis on solids skin rules for radical says what are the rules for radical just like\nI wouldn't want particularly to focus on it but we need to be aware of it right to be born but to junior senior thesis on it you know not to take it apart and solving skills as your job and she decided I chose for the story of\nA better not work for this radical guy but one of his first rules is essentially destroy the other side not let's work\nCompassionate Christian it'll it'll let let's work collaboratively together come ... used to say quote if in the closet I say come let us reason together no it's destroy the other side\nAnd and she was quite vicious uh and as I say in the book but\nI've been criticized for this but uh that's that's my view I think she systematically enabled what Bill Clinton did including just listen to the testimony as we talked about yesterday of Juanita Broderick at her interactions with Hillary\nThink he'll we knew what Bill Clinton had gone to\nA ... a Juanita Broderick and she says I was forcibly rate now I'd just as I can barely get my mind around it but at a personal moral level as a Christian we all sounded poll short or if God but this is a little bit much\nRules for radicals you get power you've got to find and get on the road ... hour and then you do whatever's necessary to maintain our once you have it\nWell if you think about it it makes perfect sense if you don't have a biblical view the universe is if you don't believe in right and wrong you don't believe that you're answering to a higher power then life is what you make of it and if you can amass power for your friends who wouldn't do it right and these are people who are eminently capable\nOf doing that now he needs to be said you know you said that a\nHillary Clinton as a young woman at Wellesley she wrote her senior thesis on song ... rules for radicals and it needs to be said that uh rules for radicals this is not a joke from my audience I'm not making this up to whom\nIs rules for radicals dedicated\nHe is dedicated to\nLoose or for that is the most chilling thing I think I have ever read on a book page when I read the dedication of rules for radicals and it's\nA it's a fundamental idea of the universe that says rebellion winning these are the things that matter the transcendent love of God and the love of truth and those things by definition go out the window so in a funny way it makes Machiavelli a you know look almost folksy\n[noise] there were clearly demonic forces at work you know we're joined by scripture truthfully for very appearance of evil and here's evil and he did it in a book a that is dedicated to the dark powers\nAre and why would one wants to do anything other than just be ... can carry on\nA carry on a carry out of the ... conversation to give a reason for the hope that is with us why would you\nDo your thesis

the title in contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation just have to ask\nYou a when recently or in the election um uh between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump we we found out that uh she had done you know many a\nSeemingly illegal things as secretary of state they did it did he grieve you that she continued this this pattern I mean when you hear\nA you know talk of of smashing blackberries with cameras and things do you think\nThis is a bad movie and yet this seems to be what happened how can how I guess how can it be to somebody this smart as Hillary Clinton would continue this pattern of this kind of thing I I just wonder what you how do you think that happened\nAt one level it is baffling because a reasonable person a rational person thinks hey you know I did something that really to steak let's leave legality aside\nYou know I'm going to try to do better I'm going to try not to make that kind of mistake again but here we see this pattern of what I'm above the law\nThe regulations don't apply and one that has to pause and say wait the person is a lawyer [laughter] that applies to every one of us ... you know we have to stop at stop signs or you know you get a ticket or so is it about this\nMentality that says why can continue\nTo do the way I Want to do it in my interest so that who knows what the specific motivation was pleasant foundation kinds of issues with here once again there are checks and balances this one of the messages in the book and I hope it's a message of hope for the American people we're seeing still unfold by\nWay of example the inspector general a stripper and taking a closer look at some of the things that happen surely condemning um Andrew McCabe who is no longer fired from the beyond the matter trip\nTurned over to the criminal division of the Justice Department for possible uh investigation and so I think when all is said and done through the next inspector general report in terms of the Clinton Foundation investigation and so forth I think we're going to do a lot going on I'm impatient\n[laughter] we want to know now we wish the intelligence communities would get their work done and get the documents that they need to report to the American people but I just say take a deep breath don't assume the worst I think that the truth will come out\nWell I guess the question is and I'm not up on this ... is um what looks like malfeasance on the part of the Clintons and the and the Clinton Foundation is that in fact being investigated as we speak\nThat as my understanding but I'm an outsider behind the bill of goods but there have been color will claims with respect to the handling all the Clinton or the investigation and I think that there is like from what I understand but these are public reports nothing on the inside there is a second careful look\nBeing a being taken especially because seeing some of the irregularities of the way for example I'm\nA Hillary Clinton's interview was conducted right a very odd way and and and the grant of immunity and so forth so there's some questionable judgment doesn't mean that there were there there were crimes and so forth so I'm not going to jump to conclusions about an hour long ago\nYeah the facts and assess the facts but there are ... seems to be much that needs to be very careful examined to see whether there was in fact a a wrongdoing and I I to me\nIt just cries out for close examination and I have great respect for both set of the show that house intelligence committee's\nI Believe in the oversight functional talk a lot about that but I also have great belief in the internal checks and balances and the Justice Department and the FBI they both the office of professional responsibility to the and the inspector general of the court of justice or real watchdogs\nWell that's encouraging and I think we need encouragement because I think many people believe that uh the Clintons always got to pass I think um to some extent because a lot of people fear them uh I I think that when you're working for people\nWho can be vindictive as they seem to have been a ... it's frightening and people think I don't want trouble\nOr even to the top levels I mean the fact that they gave her immunity or so and so what she seemed to be treated with kid gloves because people had a sense that this is going to be the next president and I better watch myself that that to me is very troubling", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "04"}
