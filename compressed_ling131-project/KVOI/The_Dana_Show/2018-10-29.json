content being covered we're going to move very quickly said I Want to read a comment a first time we start with this kind of as I opened up the previous our case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not an I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens that kind of reach out to me and I've been very friendly to them over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite smuggling is at the top that doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled it made I guess precedent on the LDC leading a leaving Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter or see them in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get a view and good luck on your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could named thirty mass shooters in America who had our past background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun you can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to ban this in reality that's not going to work because they can't be banned they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that one\nThe joy of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that want this

Hawkins\n[noise] I I got to go back to Chris Murphy for just a second okay [noise]\nBecause here's what Trump said and you pointed in there you pointed out in your piece if they had protection inside the result would have been far better this was a dispute there will always exist I suspect\nBut if they had protection inside the synagogue maybe it could have been a very different situation okay what's what's wrong with that what it Chris Murphy take exception to win that statement come again keeping in mind listener that he is a man that is protected by guns everywhere he goes in DC what's up by that\nBut what he said is he goes Trump's position is you know uh to counter dangerous people with on the East that are opposites she used to just ... days of stapled ever get done well that's state\nSale because that's a fairy tale\nHe goes on to say Trump's position works in the movie opposite she works in real life that's all I\nSee it in real life wouldn't it\nIs in real life it wouldn't work Sunday right because this guy has numerous background checks passed on his you know just to get sick from it ah and so you know we get a guy who's ... who's been vetted\nAnd it's to your point that you were actually making when you start your show a background check back where if there's no criminal history than a person who plans to most evil dated a world to log into a gun store smile by God no problem\nBecause there's no criminal history can be found in the background check and uh so Murphy doesn't understand his background checks don't work in real life they work in the movies gun free zones don't work in real life\nThey work in the movies having a large congregation of elderly congregants who are defenseless setting together on a Saturday morning that doesn't work in real life that works in the movies you got to have someone there with a gun who can take out a bad guy comes in Chris Murphy is a lunatic\nChris move Chris Murphy is also a liar he knows better he's also a hypocrite\nBecause he is protected by guns at the Capitol he understands that he knows that he's just intellectually dishonest as the rest of the socialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic\nFor they know not what they say now interestingly and I don't I'm not trying to catch off guard hairs has nothing to do with what you wrote a over the past week or today by any stretch but I heard the nine one one calls coming in or I heard the police chatter\nRadio chatter when one of the officers were those responding saying there's automatic weapons fire\nAnd that went out on recall you know to the rest of the officers ten thirty eight automatic weapons fire\nA was their automatic weapons fire there am I missing something\nNow unless you're telling me that uh yeah they are Fifteen and\nThen what I understand they are Fifteen a couple of blocks that even at three o'clock so I'm not sure but yeah you're dealing with small might have found out about this happens all the time ... and ... and what that officer\nProbably wasn't on purpose but with the gun control the Louis you know Hillary Clinton what you are\nYou'll remember Hillary Clinton used to say that one of the reasons you need a vote her will stop people from coming to school with automatic weapons you know right by\nMy mind out of my mind I don't want to make your relatives that had\nNever happened so you know but see they want to use just just like Murphy talking about semi automatic rifles they want to use the phrase olive tree to sound ominous scared of the few people who they can scare with their language\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh that's just where we are in society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time I you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't get home and do you guys you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out of your the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me W. R. if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that and we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as out in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very he's a very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason\nBecause doesn't that go that headline alone says it all AWOL that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand the evil exist evil chooses the time and place to become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true you know there's there's something I'm trying to cause harm to turn it on as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people\nAnd I and there's a corner I'm coming to terms where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be profound uh it's very simple gun control a lot of apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is\nBut the trouble is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is that he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland or you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty Eighteen or you didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth twenty Seventeen that keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedom\nCertain crimes will go away does not work that way what happens is we limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nHad I've been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this is a good substitute for freedom folks there is no\nDid not use illegal guns now for it I Want you to pick careful attention you're listening throughout the state of Florida that I\nWent to one Panama love you guys\nAre the ... am eight sixty six sixty and a number of others throughout the state\nRight now on my monitor in this cross re holster studio Capitol Hill one American news network I posit Senator Bill\nNelson on gun control calls for universal background checks on gun sales Bill Nelson is in\nIndia now you take that right to the bank why can I make that statement because the individual in Pittsburgh if we have pointed out to you for the last half hour now heading into forty minutes\nPast his background checks so ask yourself this question ward off what the hell is building a house in talking about and if you get a chance to ask him yourself and ask him what to ask him to\nTell you what gun control will work he can't you'll do what Kevin McGuire did in Great Britain he will pack up his toys and leave the sand box because he can't play with the adult a W are sorry\nI had to go off on that one I saw that and I passed it on my monitor it let me get that off my monitor so I don't go into a remark\nAbout All right we also now this doesn't surprise me either California Democrats will use and New York Democrats will use anything they can a W. R. Hawkins won't pay to push more gun control in their States isn't that true\nRight that's true how many California Democrats running for office right now are using the Pittsburgh shooting push more gun control\nAnd it's I mean California listening to the show here's what you got to think about these people are running for office they're not in office\nSale campaign like this for gun control what do you think they're going to do once they're you know you don't need that you're that California is already in the time it's already over the edge on gun control it's ridiculous and if if there's somebody who thinks one more gun laws gonna matter I mean\nThere hey they're not bright or be there in ... which means they're immune to facts and they just have the gender and I think by and large that's ... that's the case for gun control over\nWhat you know you you asked if you actually you pointed out in a statement\nAnd I ask a question and that is in your piece about Democrat Bill Nelson on this very topic I felt that was interesting when I saw that headline and I saw him on the television I just decided to snap on it for a moment but here's what you point out in your opening statement your your piece is titled Democrat Bill Nelson wants to implement gun controls already in place\nCalifornia as a W are just pointed out you can't do any more\nCali you just can't you just simply can't\nBill Nelson wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are set to open up the open up the column\nBill Nelson Democrat of course ... in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their guns what do you mean by that\n[noise] now I mean if you go back to go back ... ruled that say go back to Columbine a or a if you want to stay in the twenty first century just stay in the twenty first century I Can't think\nOf a high profile public attack where the attacker acquires guns in some way other than background checks literally\nThe the two exceptions the two exceptions or the a ... a mall sheet mall shooting\nIn Washington state and Newtown and their sets us because we both those cases the individual Stoller guns\nAnd murder I wanted to take a take a hold of them to I Want to make that very clear that out but out of that [noise] people\nPeople who shoot up places they go past background checks to get their guns and so these these these checks the worst is the only thing they accomplished is what the Democrats really\nAnd that is they make the process of ... just a little more ... than it does cause some law abiding citizens just not to bother because they don't want to go through the house that's what the Democrats really want they want to slow down to\nBuy a firearms they don't want them in anyone's hands when they say they're just gets criminals owning them they're not telling the truth they don't want anyone to have a gun\nYou better than you better believe that you better believe that they also point a lot of anger at hunters\nAnd hunters who face death threats are shooting animals legally on hunch won't go there to cover it all back right after that when they do if you are on the margins\nCheese\n...\nHi I'm going to work in radio listeners if you were looking for a less sleep with them to check out the taser poll compact easy to use and doesn't require lightened\nMost using technology trusted by law enforcement or coal can be deployed from an it's an interesting field and delivers a thirty second cycle giving users the time they need to mine safety and then you would if I see lots of teen teachers they just keep program or place it free\nOf charge ... or self defense how confident and protection to live\nHere [noise] and maintenance I got my came on I ...

they are uh prefer being\nWitchcraft and astrology witchcraft and astrology now what what's interesting is uh this this Pew Research study found that\nInterest in spirituality has been booming\nIn America in recent years especially in a among millennials interest in spirituality or the majority of Americans though but not religion the majority of Americans now believe\nIt is not necessary to believe in God to have good morals\nPer a proof of the Pew Research center\nFor the first time it's interesting a majority of Americans now believe it's not necessary\nTo believe in God to have good morals the percentage of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine millennials who never doubt the existence of God's fell\nFrom eighty one percent in oh seven sixty percent in two thousand and twelve so more and more millennials doubting the very existence of God and meanwhile the same study shows that half of young adults in the U.S believe in\nBelieve astrology is the science\nOf compared to less than eight percent of the Chinese public\nUm uh the whole psychic services industry like astrology and or reading\nA medium ship Terrell card reading all that stuff\nI'm is growing by leaps and bounds in America\nI'm now it's it's a two billion dollar annual business\nUm but formal religion you know all the stuff astrology and and uh\n\nAnd and and belief in a reading your palms or Terrell cards and all of this\nGrowing but belief in formal religion nose diving among young Americans\n\nThe study shows that younger Americans again Eighteen to twenty nine Eighteen to thirty four\nLook upon religious organizations religions as\nAnd religious organizations religions as they look upon government\nA big business uh most institutions\nA young Americans millennials look upon these institutions religion as well\nA with a high negatives they don't trust these institutions they don't believe in these institutions and so they look elsewhere\n\nThey look to astrology\nEven though astrology has been debunked by numerous academics are studies\n\nBut in the the lack of structure young Americans are drawn\nTo the lack of basic structure and that's why they don't like religion and that's why they prefer things like astrology witchcraft\n\nMystic mystic a boxes and the right key infused bath salts and all of these crazy things are just jumping crazy I shouldn't say some crazy a A R jumping among millennials but formal religion\n\nThe belief in a belief in formal religion\nPractice according to a formal religion\nPer the Pew Research center this latest study in this latest study\nConfirms other studies that we've been aware of for a long time that\nAmericans in general though still a very religious people\nStill a very moral people still a very spiritual people\nI'm no longer practice seem uh in in\nIn religions no longer formally believing in religions\nThis country that is eighty something percent Christian\nAnd juicy this\nDevelopment most

now I I Believe\nObviously like many of you do or that there is a guy in I Believe God created all of this and I believe\nThat when people begin\nTo turn away from God and the people begin to turn away from religion I eat\nIn a very imperfect Schumann way of\nUm giving\nPraise to God and trying to live out our godly faith\nIn as imperfect as all religions are and I'm raising my hand right now I'm a born and raised Catholic still a practicing Catholic and the Catholic Church right now again is going through real problems right now and by the way these real problems that the Catholic Church is going through\nA A R problems that help\nUm convince especially young Americans that religions are bogus but I Believe that when they people turn away from my God and turn away from\nA religious life I Believe eventual aid that people are turns away from morals and does in fact turn away from goodness\nI Believe that you are connected I Believe that you can be a moral person without believing in God you can be\nA good person without\nSeen a particular faith\nUh but as a people lose their connection to God and religion\nIt ain't going to happen unless the American people wake up by do know
