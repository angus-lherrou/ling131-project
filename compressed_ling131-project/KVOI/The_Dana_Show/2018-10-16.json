this also used to take the smallest\nPortion of something and make that the example like it's the it's the anecdotal you know science behind it all I Do that with\nYou know how many abortions are done because of Rick right less than one percent but they use that all the time as the reason for Ninety nine percent and it's down here with Elizabeth Warren she's using point zero nine percent of some Graham back room to prove that somebody knows\nAll in all of this is is getting into because she ... she is strategy is posturing herself or twenty twenty or twenty twenty four and I I just don't think that's going to work to by the way do you think that she's even going to be able to brush pass a quarter bookers and Kamala Harris is\nI mean that's going to be a slap fight there's going to be a lot of bad blood there there has been immersed in polling shows ah well I was looking at this race in Nevada with Dean Heller\nAnd I don't know if it's a legit I haven't looked at the crosshairs of it\nUm because in Nevada Dean Heller has been running second to the Democrat or like neck and neck it's been very very very tough [noise] there's a new Emerson poll\nA that shows Heller winning I'm a bunch of different demos and it shows him pull him several points F head several points ahead I don't I I think it's it shows him seven points that I don't I think it's a lot tighter than seven points ahead\nUm and but apparently it has the it's the ... they call it the calving off that um\nI if Dean Heller does and I said this on the show before if Dean Heller does stay on\nAnd he he wins this race there's no way in Haiti that Democrats will ever take over in the Senate ever at all so the the in Arizona in Montana and the Senate those are the um those are the races that everybody's that everybody's looking at\n'em and they're I mean they're pretty tight there pretty tight races there are number Texas a GOP is leading in Texas Tennessee uh in Missouri I Can't even believe it or Missouri was Claire McCaskill my gosh but it's a CBS battleground battleground poll that shows that the blue wave\nA the the back firing of the way Democrats handled Kavanaugh is hitting them hard at the polls now they're starting we're starting to feel the tide has come in on that and it's starting to show up and all the polling data now\nYes they do various you know sweep after sweep after sweet and now there is the possibility\nOf their blue wave perhaps being neutralized because of the cabinet effect I mean at least with the Senate for sure [noise] um and\nWith the house it could be that the same thing uh because now all of these different there are a couple of polls that show all of these different some of the race is sort of shifting a little bit\n[noise] um and that is due to their really in saying I mean there's no way to put it they're they're completely insane way of of uh handling a the cabinet thing so [noise] the whole hearing and and all of that stuff\nSo and looking at this um because bite into looking as though some people think Biden might stand up and twenty twenty and even if Biden stands up and twenty twenty there's a new CNN poll showing that Trump would likely still when [laughter] if if if Biden ends up running on twenty twenty\nThere is I'm looking at a couple of different things here uh in\nAddition to dean in addition to Dean Heller pulling ahead of Texas I'm Ted Cruz a Josh Holly in uh Missouri now NBC News is showing that Democrats have a Latino problem\nAnd they're wondering why they're wondering why Hispanics and Latino voters are not marching in line to go and vote for Democrats\nAnd they even know quote even with the Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at the top of the Texas ticket it hasn't been easy Democrat officials say\nWhy and how would it be easier if it was a white guy the again he was warning his way trying to Elizabeth Warren his way into a seat he's trying to fake Hispanic his way into a seat this is crazy\nThey actually said that they actually said this\nThey're like we don't understand why in Texas Hispanics are more enthusiastic about\nPeter O'Rourke because he's white how do you have racist that is do you get the impression that they are assuming that because he copped a ... a Hispanic sounding nickname that that's going to make voters think that he's Hispanic\nI okay I'm All right [laughter] yeah\nIt it's that but that's why betas doing data\nThat's why he's doing it but the takeover of the house is starting to look a little bit more difficult the dog we had to pull out that said a Democrat house when quote far from certain an elusive sin it's nearly impossible [noise]\nAh the cabin all effect was disastrous for Democrats now they're still what we're still a cup cup do reach out\nSo they I mean I don't know maybe they could maybe they could turn it around I don't but if I were still we're just now getting the first sort of\nRipple in the public's perception of how Democrats handled Kavanaugh uh and and Trump his approval\nIn his approval went up and because his approval went up and because there was a really negative reaction to the way voters saw Democrats handling the cabinet situation they're now going to transfer that onto Democrat candidate and that is going to be disastrous in states where it is too close to call\nIt is and then in the states where Republican candidates have been starting to pull away from Democrats there are going to have an even greater gap like in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn up against Phil ... and ... it wasn't always like that but Kavanaugh gave black burn a huge boost Kavanaugh has given Dean Heller a boost given cruise a boost it's given Josh Hawley it'd be a a boost\nThis was disastrous for them\nAnd by the way some people are are are\nI'm\nWatching this and wondering oh Jim Messina who work with rock Obama said why in the world that Elizabeth Warren cannot do there was a couple of weeks before the election wind the world of this woman do this\nHe he legit asked why did she do this right so close to a a midterm election because that looks horrible that could have a negative down ticket effect on in her state\nOh my gosh oh my gosh so yeah I mean\nIt is just bad all the way around\nIt's about all the way around it's just not going to it's not going to go to offer them pain no\nAnd it's it's weird to see how this is all trending right 'cause usually the messaging has always been a problem with Republicans and right now they need to capitalize on his messaging\nAnd they're not doing it still the media's got this narrative out there that's really driving a message for Democrats as though there's some sort of substance with what they're running on a twenty twenty or even veterans for them yeah but come on this is this is so obvious to me no\nMean how crazy is the media in on their side\nOf some nuts mhm mhm listening message messenger\nMessaging and well and and they just I it just shows I\nAnd well and and they just I it just shows I think that there isn't a really good focus Democrats do not have a strong focus right now um where it concerns how they're how they're running this this race or how they're running any of their races um\nRun against success successful economy all the things that people actually care about in this country which has their own money their own patriots how they put

the world and getting an advantage over America and our allies in the region\nA book I'm I'm completely open to the possibility that the Saudi Arabian government is involved in this potential murder a but let's let the evidence come in and then let's deal with it within the context of this is an outrageous act against one person\nOr it crosses a several lines and should be dealt with seriously\nBut when you're dealing not just with oil prices but with\nA potential resurgence of terrorist networks in the broader Middle East failure of what has been a counter movement and stuff in Syria or that may be leading to some semblance of stability there but maybe not a and that the rivalry for mastery in the middle east is\nIs one where an Iran takeover is\nDevastating to American interests in my view a and so we have to keep I think those broader equities in mind uh but that doesn't mean that the Saudis or anyone else gets to pass we just have to kind of keep perspective\nOn how big of a threat to our national interest is this potential murder or versus the other potential millions of lives at stake and other major national interests\nYeah yeah and and and yeah I I I agree how ... and you know it's in keeping that in mind if I say and just to explore at the United states from work to\nA dead end in association with the Saudi ... was Saudi Arabia or you know put for sanctions et cetera et cetera I what does that do to the region and what does that do to Saudi Arabia's ability\nTo push back against as you were talking about kind of another proxy war with all of these different groups you know who these in the rebel groups have been fighting in Syria a ... and and against Iran which of course has Russia as\nAs you know it's quite a benefactor and what does that did it what does that do to their chance to be able to kind of be stable in that realm and that and that are in that part of the world\nWell number one it would turn the Saudis from B. or at least somewhat customers and collaborators with the United states to them turning to the Chinese and the Russians\nAnd for in terms of there and the military or development and there are broader interest in the region and if you happen to like the very destabilizing influences that Russia and China have been in the broader Middle East than you would add fuel to that by going down that road\nAnd you may say in principle we have to because it's such an outrage fair judgments but the but you have to weigh it reasonable estimation of what the pros and cons are uh I think that it it basically puts permanently in place of Charlotte Assad in Syria which maybe is going to be the case anyway\nBut it also runs the risk of\nFurther destabilizing Iraq\nAh and if if we think that sanctions on Saudi Arabia would be a temporary instability oil markets weight to some of the other things happen and never forget that are more empowered Iran a more disoriented Saudi Arabia puts our ally Israel at even greater risk than it already lonesome region\nMhm what do you say what do you say to some of the reaction some of the hot takes like for instance Yahoo News was saying oh well we spoke with a colleague of 'cause there'll be the end of the Washington Post and they said it said the Saudis probably did this to ... and after hearing Trump's remarks on the media\nThat seems I mean I Can't believe they're verified blue checked I kept running with us but that's I mean that's actually one of the the spins as being pedaled\nBut has to be among the most more ironic things I've ever heard in my entire life I mean really you're going to go and get here say\nFrom someone who supposedly works in a similar news organization that's as far from evidence as anything we have been talking about in recent times ah and ah there's there's a story about he supposedly recorded all of this on his apple watching uploaded his eyes cloud and people within minutes are able to say well apple watches can't do this\nAnd so there's a whole lot of course hockey going on in terms of what people think they know and what they're saying but we have got to get a legit journalists away from the idea well I talked to so and so and they said this that's not confirmation that's not evidence\nRight now exactly definitely not at all but it's enough to get it out there like the New York times with\nAh the piece that they had a saying that well you know this is the the Saudi prince he went to dissent reality is breaking up is charming media narrative and it didn't in an intimate set that the president was naive because you know he really believed that maybe perhaps the new crown prince was ever a former et cetera which\nI mean in a in a in a region where there are no great choices some choices are better than others and I know that new wants his dad but thing is that this dead\nIt in some people's minds if their sole mission in life is to prove that the president United States is the source of all evil in the universe than we have a a breathtaking number of people who seem to build their lives around what I consider to be a very pessimistic and sad notion a in a you know I kept myself among those\nWho've been fairly hard core against dictators and other kinds of these stabilizing influence as they've been critical of the Saudis are but uh if someone says that this leader of Saudi Arabia wants to try to reform\nAnd do some things the right way I'm at least going to stand back and say well let's see what he does and that's what he does is these like this\nAre they give us pause it just has to be balanced against interests that are bigger than an individual uh and I you know it's going to take some time for people to\nMaybe step back and sober up and grow up a little bit about what we're doing in the world because this is a dangerous region broadly speaking what the president's been doing has been good for the United states in my Afghan around the world or whether it's on purpose or by accident it's on his watch and it's happening and that I think\nIs very underestimated by the alleged experts in the media\nYeah at CNN was reporting I mean and again you know just it it even if they were this was accurate but they were they're reporting that the Saudis are preparing a report that dies into what happened to cause so gay and may perhaps saying that he\nUh this as a result of an interrogation gone wrong or if if so\nHow what would be the best ...\nI Would imagine you know obviously going up in the midterms and and seeing the spin all that on this already I'm I'm I'm just wondering how that how it would affect how it affects ended the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia I mean obviously you can't have them acting like China or Russia\nShip between the United states and Saudi Arabia I mean obviously you can't have the ... like China or Russia um but at the same time I feel like there's so much more to this and then as you said you know people are just making all of these knee jerk reactions to it and no one's really getting into the details\nBut if they come out with this report and say this what does that change\nWell I don't think there's anything about this story that's good and it definitely is a going to be a complication for U.S foreign policy\nOr were you obviously don't have any control over what foreign governments do and people vastly different cultures think is acceptable and we certainly do\nUh but so I I just I don't think that this is an easy or good for any right to deal with this one or otherwise uh it's a little bit stunning to me that they're talking about this kind of report I mean\nI don't use steam at all helpful to their own cars or just at first blush if it's true but look right Randy what the report actually is\nA yeah I wouldn't expect to have a hundred percent truth from any government about this kind of thing but because of bad subject to have to report\nRight exactly and I I Would anticipate them also suggest you know oh well it wasn't a unapproved operation will punish the people responsible I mean if they even come out and say this is a way to get ahead of it and that would be really weird but I don't know if that's because of the new crown prince and the direction that their foreign policy is taking under their reformation or what but\nNow this is going to be a very uh

I think it was killing Monroe cool but before I forget I said that we're gonna we're gonna have David Limbaugh an hour to in fact he's going to be tomorrow in our two today I Am talking to a brilliant\nComedian some of you may know him or some of you may not know him but I have to tell you a I Love him he's brilliant his name is Michael junior he's got a movie coming out this week\nUh but I'll be talking about an hour or two but right now folks I get to talk ... talk to my friend Kelly Monroe cool birds Kelly welcome to the program\nThanks for having me Eric well anyway and congratulations on your new book Donald drain the swamp\nI thank you for being aware that I have this book coming out I'm all a Twitter about it literally and I tell you about actually before I forget I wanted to tell my my audience that you have been really involved in exposing George Soros and all this kind of stuff but I Want to say that a lot of people would know you from your book\nFinding God at Harvard or which came out a number of years ago when all kinds of awards finding God at Harvard and then you begin what's called the ... forum hard to believe\nYou you began it so long ago suddenly Nineteen Ninety two is a long time ago and it's an over two hundred universities um it it it's just amazing very tough form explores you know the the tough questions with regard to biblical truth and Jesus and what it was just tremendous stuff I Want people to know a little bit about who you are um but\nToday we're talking about George Soros now by the way did you know Kelly or cause you spent a lot of years now investigating George Soros and what he's doing with evangelicals but did you know that he might be a figure in my Donald drain the swamp book\nReally at that you really exciting to hear\nHe might he might not there's a there's a dinosaur in the swamp he's the scariest when he's called the George Soros\nAnd said some people have said he resembles George shores obviously it's not intentional but I just thought you'd find it funny [noise] um and by the way the journal that represents Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell it's not fair to say that it's Mitch McConnell because you know what every\nTurtle to be perfectly honest [laughter] whether it means do or doesn't look exactly like Mitch McConnell of what I mean what do y'all do that's turtles you can't blame yeah like when you ask\nThe weeks ago I think he deserves beyond\nLeader that isn't that interesting it's a it's like he and Lindsey Graham they came out of the swamp and are they going to stay out of the swamp we'll see I I Hope that they said\nThey started listening to America imagine that\nYeah imagine that okay so listen we've got to expose the truth here you've been doing it but I Want to do it on this program tell us what you discovered with regard to George sources billions and evangelicals in America\nSure and you know it is a little bit beret taught scenes truth is is not a very tough for them I'm getting now get clear however I became very concerned about America and they said in fundamental transformation that is not\nInevitable ah ... the decline of America is not an inevitable I realized we're being outmaneuvered my husband David ... a novelist who wrote a little great novel called breaking babble\nAnd we literally followed the plot it was fiction predicting life reality and it was a global if billionaire trying to swing the U.S election by finding\nFake kind of fake ministers into great prominence why to divide the actual faith vote\nSo they realize you know let's get we ... we started doing research and realize that sorrows with funding through open society foundation that's or S. dot org twenty five billion dollar foundation now\nWhat's funding Jim Wallace Sojourners faith in public life faithful America\nA Catholics for choice Catholics in alliance for the common good\nI mean they will be on an island is how deep this goes I I Believe that George\nSoros and Jim Wallace Sojourners who again they've taken a ... I mean the Sojourners and the evangelical left has taken a sharp left this is not the left of the eighties or the nineties\nAnd so they've gotten to people like John cases people wonder what happened to John ... that's what happened in ... and various\nYes when listeners begin to think what's happening to my church and why is that suddenly the social justice agenda defined by the left follow the money that's what we\nIt's sad but true uh where you know sorrows with funding Al Gore and John Kerry for president they lost that was a meeting why do we do we need the faith narrative\nAnd it's a a wicked kind of a lens key tactic and and storage began funding groups like Sojourners to literally teach the last ... cherry pick a few Bible words to sound like ministers they were like ministers and it can\nSounds like ministers they mess up like ministers and he uses the normal and Americans just they don't understand and so um it's a clever tactic and we just he just said well I ... and that's and that's that well like I got it look\nLet me let me let me say this and this people are gonna think this sounds a ridiculous ... I think it but I don't because I I Know the story and I've done the research\nWhen the church in Germany was infiltrated by the national socialists okay they were very clever they understood that if we can work with people who are biblical he is not illiterate I don't know the Bible particularly well we can sell them whatever we want to sell them\nThe same thing is happening when in America George Soros funded people they throw phrases out there you just said they they grab a Bible verse like oh we're supposed to welcome the alien blah blah blah and people say on that of course means open borders and like I say wait a second\nThat's insane that doesn't mean open borders that means we're supposed to be loving and we're supposed to welcome the alien it doesn't mean we're supposed to change national policy so that no American is safe and we don't know who's coming into our country and we don't know where country begins and ends to make that leap is lunacy but people\nCan be persuaded because they don't really know what the scripture teachers or they don't have a sophisticated understanding of how you marry what the Bible says to public policy they just use these catch words like welcome to LA and if that simple doesn't a Bible say welcome the audience and rats with George Soros has done\nAnd it is really dangerous and if you and if you think that the church cannot be taken over in America and that the government can't be taken over in this way\nI just have to point to the Nineteen thirties long before anybody was talking about death camps or the Holocaust\nThe German church was saying uh hey you know what we can work with um with the national socialist and the national socialist pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed until the church got infiltrated and that is effectively what has happened\nTo many parts of the American church the but the fact that you've done the research Kelly now people want to find out more about this is there any place they can go to our website\nYes yeah we we created some it's American eating and yell at golf with an ass American even ... dot com\nAnd there's a great wealth Fifteen minute video store at this formula for

can look it up they can look into it\nAnd people have an sinking Lee as I just said with regard to you know welcome the alien ... you think wait a second you're grabbing one scripture averse\nAnd you're saying that you can beat people over the head and say that we shouldn't have borders and we should change our policies ... based on one scriptures that is insanity I mean it's no different than finding a script reverse that promotes slavery I mean you know you're you you can't\nYou can't do that you have to try to understand what is the scriptures teach us of course we are supposed to be welcoming but it doesn't mean that we're supposed to change our national policies in so Soros 'em and Jim Wallace and others have very uh cynically in some cases in ... case it is totally cynically\nAnd Wallace his case ah I I think it might be well meaning lately but ignorant Lee has has twisted the scriptures and people have\nTo go along with it they're not willing to speak up about it and I think listen\nThese people are stealing your kids these the your your kids they have good hearts and they think this sounds like a good thing chair and they drift along with ...

are from Texas\nI'm Talking to my friend Kelly Monroe cool Burke uh Kelly before I forget you know here we are talking about\nUm young people being led astray\nOr by George George Soros\nFunded groups a lot of these groups claim to be\nA evangelicals they're really a socialist veering toward secularist left these and it's disturbing so I Want to put it in a good word before we continue this conversation some people know that I'm always talking about Hillsdale College\nIn Michigan why because they are doing just the opposite they teach young people or what\nIt means to believe in American style self government and liberty\nOr it teaches kids what is good and beautiful and true that's the whole point of education and they're doing it there but the reason I bring them up is because they're also trying to do this they're committed their president the or the president Hillsdale College my friend Dr Larry aren't\nUh they're all committed to reaching beyond\nUm the ivy walls of Hillsdale or to reach everybody in America so we've got a website ma taxes for Hillsdale dot com if you go to my taxes for he'll still dot com you can find out all the stuff that they want to do\nFor you they're they're just reaching out they often offer actual college courses with actual Hillsdale professors to you that you can watch on line really great stuff that I'm In Texas for Hillsdale dot com so Kelly Goldberg um the website that you have set up is American evangelicals dot\nCom um do you think that this election hangs in the balance of because evangelicals are being swayed in this direction\nI Do have nearly and sadly millions of evangelicals don't even vote and I just think it I could see if you're dying or that and then having not voting but I Can't imagine any other reason given what's in the balance\nA and so this is why Soros dire and these guys are trying to break up the evangelical wise\nUm tendency to to vote for the\nParty that Republican platform right it's not it beyond a President Trump it's it's the future of the country but that we're talking about and so the reason for us and\nOthers Obama even what funding through that phase apartment uh some faith groups to see the mass migration was that it was quickly connected to a ... to voter registration right and so this is about\nPower and period and um sadly open society foundation is at twenty five billion dollar foundation funding all this\nA lot of the stuff around the world America's wind up dozens of countries that he's undermining and demoralizing so we need to wake up deal with the the the ... and stuff\nAnd we need to vote and we need to bring our white friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I I you know I speak all around the country and I and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to say politics is not for me that crocheting politics don't mix that is bad\nTheology is bad it's not good luck with the Bible said that I'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people\nSince the beginning of time at miss understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed in poll\nLeft towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how and I I have to say with Kanye West\nOr you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate may be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think we have to think\nFor ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy your future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you float along with the socialists\nTied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this uh it's just so good to have you wind up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and
