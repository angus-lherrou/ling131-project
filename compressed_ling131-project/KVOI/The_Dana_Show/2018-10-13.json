around serious Christians black or white or Asian or whatever it is we have a biblical view\nOf sexuality we say sex is for marriage is between a man and a woman that's will Christians have always believed in so so many people I Know black people there in the church they believed that with all their heart\nBut somehow they have been forced to be perceived as being in lockstep with the Democratic platform which has pushed\nVery very hard away from that and it's even tried to say\nThat the civil rights movement of Dr King are and and all of these great people of dignity that it's the same thing as the L GB T. Q. movement right now and I feel that there are many or a black Christians who felt disenfranchised says hey wait a minute wait a minute I don't agree with that\nBut I don't really have a voice in the Democratic party and I'm assuming that's one of the reasons that you came along or to to uh to advocate for Trump obviously who is a Republican\nI didn't like but Democrats are the three of our country and if you had a belief that if they were your religious beliefs and belief that we talked for for for for years\nAnd they were basically they bully you know you can't have that belief anymore I don't think that's what really outrageous people everyone they cook it back up in a corner\nAnd what they were created the silent majority dry and so when Donald Trump came along it's like oh I I Will give you a voice that I'm going to protect religious freedom\nI don't care what anybody do and the compatibility of your home but you can't push stuff up all the people and they have their beliefs or their religious convictions about those beliefs so but the Democrats did it for the Obama for the Republican Party but\nObama said that he pushed what Hollywood wanted\nIt not push what the average Americans want it\nAnd it is because people showed up at the polls\nWe didn't wait to back it up at the back you had all of these people these women market in the streets of the capital and they\nThought oh so what we want to vote for him and if you look at our president\nHave attacked the religious freedom he's making sure you have a job but he's he's creating the atmosphere or in a good economic opportunity for you if you want to become an entrepreneur you care\nI mean he's got more within these past almost two years old bottle was able to do an eight year okay and what I Love it though I'm not beholden to anyone\nBut the American people working for the American people right out the president of the I'm the president of the United states I loved him for that\nWell as I say it's it's just refreshing to hear you say these things and you know\nI guess what you're talking about with religious freedom and that's one of the biggest issues that I've ever talked about on this program and wherever I go giving speeches religious liberty religious freedom has become the issue of our day because it's one of these things that we had so much of it in America nobody really thought about it until more recently suddenly\nYou realize he's under attack people are saying not just we want to live our lives this way but if you do not agree with us we will persecute you we will shut down your businesses and you know ... and others they would have lost their businesses and some of them did\nUh because of this kind of activism and that's on American and so as I say\nThat a lot of people have been pushed along with that and I think many people represented I Know many of my black friends who would have voted Democrat years ago have stopped doing that because the turn that the Democrats took mainly under Obama we know it would have been worse under Hillary unfortunately", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "13"}
