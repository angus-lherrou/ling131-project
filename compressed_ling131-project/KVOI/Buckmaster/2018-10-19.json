uncompromising secularism has become something of religion in the United\nStates we're talking about Saudi Arabia turkey hockey's done\nWell how bout Decatur, Georgia there is a case in Decatur, Georgia that is just unbelievable as an assault not only on religious faith but on the common sense and it's one of those cases that I think should convince you about\nWhy you have to get involved the alliance defending freedom because they're standing up for people who are victimized by this kind of insanity and one of the people who is doing the most\nTo stand up to this kind of insanity is our guest his name is Matt Sharp he is a senior counsel for the ATF the alliance defending freedom a man thanks very much for joining us thank you for having me\nOkay we've played tape before on this show of Pasha at Thomas maybe you can explain who she is and what happened to her five year old daughter back a less than a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nThat's right so cautious daughter\nA school that had with little notice to parents adopted a transgender bathroom policy with essentially said boys if they identify as a girl\nCan use the girl facilities can use the girls restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day cautious daughter in the hour we're going by and they're supposed to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom and a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid with also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom to boy came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter\nA ... ... ... that evening I learned about it her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be to hear that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out\nThat this happened because the schools transgender policy specifically allowed this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy is the schools just basically any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right and all it takes is for students to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assume that when you say that the little girl five years old was molested she was touched it was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the right to health but um and something\nThat we would all be involved I of course with you Paul and anybody who has children or grandchildren is gonna be appalled by that so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authority said or\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they shared the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent with do take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in helping or seek the justice that the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont this is Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that girls going to girls restrooms boys go into a voice\nAnd if you've got a student that's struggling with this youth you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a\nTeacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities at the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia as being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay as so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you'd think that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next here ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taken seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and holds them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not\nWorth it it's called an arm like what happened\nTo pass his daughter there are better solutions but the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls\nRestrooms or vice versa those were supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... Decatur school district did hear\nOkay I'm speaking to match they amassed sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom\nAnd he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I'd give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skills of this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation\nAnd it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC or religious liberty is still under assault and it's under a song or by bureaucrats by local officials bites\nUm by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards in many many different areas and\nRight now you're on something of a winning streak over at ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible when from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently she Cochran also in Atlantic getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs\nOkay be part of this take part in it um maybe there's not that much we can do right now to save this poor Christian Woman who's been condemned\nTo death for blasphemy\nOr for talking about Jesus or but we certainly can defend people here right in the United states go to the alliance defending freedom a and and you'll find that go to Michael med dot com\nOr for the southern than it that he's stuck her before he died and honestly I'm ...\nI I was I'm going to call up here and I'm the only that I couldn't go looking for your

moment of a way that the Obama administration mishandled the situation in Egypt\nA Hosni Mubarak and been virtual dictator of Egypt for a long time\nAnd Hosni Mubarak was not Thomas Jefferson and he wasn't Ronald Reagan and he was in some sort of benign ruler is a tough guy they did not support\nPersonal liberties or freedom of expression in Egypt and then when the Arab Spring came to Egypt we let the Mubarak\nRegime collapse and did no one any favors because Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nOf they were awful they caused the disaster in the country the military came in fortunately and they supported a too with general al Sisi and he is now the dictator of Egypt and\nIs he vastly better and more of a Democrat more of a liberal than a Hosni Mubarak probably he's not he's probably less of one\nBut it's a difficult part of the world it's a part of the world where there are murderers terrorists\nAs the alternative and by the way the same thing is true in Saudi Arabia do I believe that uh Mohammed bin Solomon is I don't know the second coming of Nelson Mandela know\nOr the guy has real sluggish aspects but he also has real religious reforms that he has been undergoing\nAllowing women to drive was a very big deal and the radicals who are the main opposition of this regime and when I say radicals I don't mean radicals on the left I mean radicals on the Islamic right\nOr they would love to get rid of Mohammed bin Salman\nHe's also it was called back the religious police who used to run wild and Saudi Arabia and and most of all he has really been leading the way was trying to get Saudi Arabia to engage with the west I Know there's this you know that they used to ban movies entirely\nAnd he's a good good for them I mean even movies as you would
