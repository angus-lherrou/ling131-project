cream of the crowd is\nMichael ... and on the Michael ... show uh it's I think sort of necessary\nTo talk about the campaign going forward\nAnd why I Do believe that the emphasis on birthright citizenship debating topic on both sides is unfortunate and I wish the president hadn't brought it up he brought it up in an interview with actually I was a few days before the campaign and\nThe the reason I think it's a problem is not just because it's a problem in terms of constitutional interpretation\nBut the reason that the Brett Kavanaugh experience and the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh who's a credit to the Supreme Court and I think is one of the truly great achievements that President Trump is manages getting Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on that Supreme Court\nThat United every Republican in every conservative and they're really where no exceptions I I don't know of anyone who's still calls himself a Republican\nWho opposed the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I Know I Know Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post was against Brett Kavanaugh whether it's it's she's no longer a Republican in a sense\nAnd basically you win elections by uniting your side and dividing the other side\nAnd this not only this you nights are sided also undermines a core principle and let me go back to this Kavanaugh's confirmation fight the reason that it was so important to get right to have it on the court is because he is what is called an originalist which means that you look at the constitution\nAnd it means what it says\nJohn Adams is famous for saying facts are stubborn things well words are stubborn things they have a clear meaning where is there any doubt\nAny real down about what a what this means um\nThe constitution the United states in the fourteenth amendment which was adopted Nineteen sixty eight\nSays all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other state we're in they resign\n\nHe hears ... basically what people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nIn ... by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point of balance\nWall Street journal making that point the real point about this is that there is neither political will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship president\nTrump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground and virtually\nAll Republicans in nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the door is open to everybody\nNobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe with the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true he would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not\nPossible birthright citizenship is not going to change 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practice there's a Wall Street journal and again nothing new York Times of Wall Street journal there's been very supportive of President Trump's generally\nAs Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always draft and campaign for a constitutional amendment that Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less an amendment to the constitution so he's making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day", "year":
