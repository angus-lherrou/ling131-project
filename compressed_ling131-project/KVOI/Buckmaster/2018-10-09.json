who is Neal panic or I don't know him personally but it says that he is the editor in chief of book in film globe and the author most recently of not coming soon to a theater near you\nSo it was one of those people in there of course many many of them who tries to make a living putting words together\nAnd he says now in this piece that after the two thousand Seventeen World Series where he was living out a desire to see a Dodgers game\nHe uh looked in the mirror and realize he was wasting his life\nAnd he says I've been sober now for eleven months\nI Do the same things with my time that I did before except that Seventy five percent of my life doesn't revolve around obtaining are consuming we'd it's incredible what you can accomplish when you're not high\nIn many ways I'm lucky my addiction didn't have more consequences I never got arrested my family stayed together somehow\nBut I've lost a ton of dignity and integrity intangibles that I may never reclaim\nIt wasn't so hard to go cold turkey says I had a couple of twitching nights and that was it but it's easier to stay off the stuff because I don't live in a state where it's legal\nI can get wheat but it requires a few steps addicts in legal states aren't so fortunate now all of a sudden he's saying for addicts obviously it's tougher if you live in a legal stay 'cause it's all around you\nIs advertised\nA few weeks after a sober up I took a business trip to California in my hotel room was less than a mile away from three recreational we dispensaries I paste around and got into the tub with some twelve step literature finally I went to a marijuana anonymous meeting in West Hollywood it was a friday night\nAnd the room was packed with addicts these are all marijuana antics some my age but most younger struggling to recover a life lost to weed\nSo profound\nLet's go to your calls in to ban in Los Angeles Ben you're on the Michael ...\nGreat to speak with you I listen all the time thank you\nI excellent uh well I wanted to call and say that I Am a former addict of marijuana still struggling with it um about sixty days um\nOr take a couple of relapses um you know\nIt's very true that when it became recreational in California or even went to a medical but all the stories of being around\nIt became so much harder to quit because every corner you look you find it and everybody talks about it that you know it's a good thing and it's helpful but it's really not because that growers\nKeep thinking it's stronger and there's really no regulation out there to stop them from making it stronger and no regulations on what type of pesticides they use on the actual marijuana but keep them fresh for longer so they can sell them at heart\nSo whenever I Would go in one of the marijuana shot everything was about making it stronger not about recreation or having a good time or medical it was only about right at the point that they would try to convince you to go by you know a cannabis cup winter like how is\nTheir reward show\nA rope award show for some you know for drug\nBecause people are selling it and there may getting rich on it he hears the basic point a band ... what led you to\nTry to stop the habit to to overcome your habit your addiction\nBecause I noticed that it was starting to take over my life every moment of the day I was trying to finish all my life and so I can get back home I never really did it in like none of my friends do it like there was something that\nGot me and I got addicted and I was very ashamed on it but at the moment I was thinking what is the quickest way I can finish my eye or today\nAnd I can go to the shop you know pick up whatever add up and go into my bedroom and start smoking and over time I noticed that I Would stop doing that or a only put put in twenty five percent of my effort into it and I started feeling I think\nWhere you are describing you should read this piece by Neil Patel like a because what you're describing is almost exactly what he's describing God God Bless you and Godspeed to you in your new life appreciate it or let's go quickly to bill in Minneapolis bill you're on the bench out\nLike as ours I really appreciate you taking my call you back I'm\nI said just Neal Pollack might have some ... some mental health issues in addition to his problems I've known people since then Fifteen I had the misfortune of uh smoking pot in high school and\nThat's a smoking pot in high school\nAnd through my adulthood and I've never seen people behave the way that he behaves I'm\nPouring water on their head holding their pants down haven't crying fits outside of games and I would argue with your last caller that like most bars there there's fear of elbow there's wine available there's ever clear there's ... people have a wide variety of\nYes I Am now not everybody not everybody reacts the same way but\nLet me I I I remember in college um\nWhere all of a sudden marijuana seemed to take over and people instead of drinking a lot of beer will be smoking a lot of uh\nOf wheat and I I Know people I could name them I won't um but I Know people who behaves exactly like that who who got\nThere were there were many people including one to three of the people that I ruined with\nWhere it was it was a visible problem if you could see it immediately wasn't\nSubtle authors examine four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports are kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consume alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use\nMarijuana regularly but the study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol abusers the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen studying response inhibition that's an individual's ability to change their actions helped me to goal researchers found the teams using
