the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate the world's greatest deliberative body as it's known\nAnd the the Judiciary Committee is pondering\nA couple of references in Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook\nIn Nineteen eighty three here here's the story\nEarlier today group of Georgetown Prep alumni confirmed Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the term\nUh devil's triangle\nWhich he was asked about by the committee effort surfaced in his year book\nBefore alumni were named a land sea Davis Bernard McCarthy junior pull Marion Matthew Quinn clarified that the term devil's triangle refers indeed not to a sexual act as has been alleged by Kavanaugh's detractors\nBut rather to uh drinking game they played in high school they actually played the drinking game devil's triangle\nQuote devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation of the game quarters when we played rebels try and go for people sat at a table on the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shooter\nThe shooter attempted to bounce a quarter\nInto watching the glasses wrote the alumni we do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity to watch it was just a game

witnesses\nThat what the committee found is held up and then some [noise]\nThe main thing for me\nThat you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job without it for us the answer is yes\nThey interviewed over a hundred and fifty people\nAbout the course of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nDoes from for interviews no evidence of that so many
