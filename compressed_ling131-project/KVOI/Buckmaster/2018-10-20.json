Mexican Government and Guatemalan government so they pass through and do know she'll get I don't know I mean I yeah I have a lot of people who they blame George Soros for everything\nAnd I don't know I I I I said I'm not one of those people unless I absolutely know who's behind something I don't sit there and all this is George ... but it it does that the question who is who's behind that gathered these folks together who's who fed them who kept in ... in in uh in healthy state uh before they made their march and\nAnd and the timing right here before the midterms and whenever that in a second\nHow did multi thousands of Hondurans just all of a sudden get together and say let's go out of the country together now and my point the government of Honduras going to say oh yeah go right ahead all you pick ... no they on buddy paid the Honduran haven't\nWell somebody ... somebody's financing something and that's that's the anybody with a brain can see that I don't know who this I don't know where the money's coming from but the ... if it's not just a a a a generic thing that's happening grass roots are Hondurans who are just they're fed up and they banned it together to migrate to the U.S again that's just not how it\nHappens guys I mean I don't look at what happened when they were fleeing Syria and all those places they weren't banding together into a and a large group so they were they were pushed by the by the people who are making money off of funneling these people for their pushed into these camping and put on boats together\nThey didn't decide to join up with like a giant party of thousands of people that's just not how it happens and\nAnother point to that end is is the cameras I mean Tom ... the news people were having practically there since day one when they got there to the Mexican border I of course they're they're up to speed walking with these people how that\nHappened and did you notice how many people in amongst the group all had cameras and there were people who were pushing the others\nAlone work this whole thing is manufactured it's manufacture and it's manufactured for one\nIncident just like everything else at the Democrat Party has done and I'm not going to say the Democratic party per se is behind this but I guarantee you a somebody allied with them probably it absolutely but every single thing that has been done today whether it's Robert Mueller which we are going to get to later today Robert Miller\nStormy Daniels are then of course you had the blaze before and the accusations against Kavanaugh that whole debacle you have all this stuff it is it has gone to attack President Trump specifically put press\nJohn to attack President Trump specifically put pressure on him and in this regard it's obvious what's going on here oh you you're never going to deny this group of ... and this is how the media talks about women and children this is mostly women and children turn on any network if you want to talk about the women and children ...\nLook at the crowd that's the one beautiful thing about having the cameras rolling their\nIt's mostly young men this entire body think yeah I can I can spot a child here and there and there than what you have a few children are pushed up front there ... they've all been carried up front by the end there certainly females in the midst but the bulk of this crowd is young males and that's obvious to the to the untrained eye\nI of course you have to have a you know high high training to be a reporter these days right I mean otherwise if you had a brain you'd actually be you know speaking the truth and you wouldn't be able to qualify as a journalist\nThe Jones He's got a little bit before um Saturday afternoons four to six on ten thirty gave you a well his voice [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nOnly ten thirty voice totally seven nine zero zero zero seven nine zero point to you for\nAnd we're back with you like in the production out of work studios this is common sense but you also Morgan\nAll right so we have\nA president Donald Trump willing to actually do what first of all he said he would do and secondly what he said he would do happens to coincide with the oath of office he took imagine that\nImagine imagine that somebody actually took their oath of office and uh apparently meant what they said Tom that's apparently what what what I'm getting from everything that that President Trump is doing he said I I Will uphold the constitution and of course everybody says oh\nHe's attacking the free press no he calls them out for the liars and fraud that they are that's not attacking the free press that's talk attacking and calling out a bunch of ... which I Do too and anybody else with the brain does because it's at ... essentially what what we see and\nWhat you have here\nWith President Trump once you get ... and its downs me that anybody thinks a blue wave is coming there is no blue wave coming\nIt's not happening I don't even think we're going to see a blue trickle I think if you really want if you want my honest they got opinion I think you'll probably see a slight red trickle okay I ... and I totally agree with Rush Limbaugh steak but I've been saying for months\nHe was on a Sean Hannity's show and he did an interview there and what she said we're going to have five to seven or pick ups in the Senate and I agree with that I think the Republicans are going to have five to seven pickups in the in the center\nFor sure but I think that they're not only just got to maintain a house I think that they might actually have some pick up some of their own um and I don't know that goes against conventional wisdom I don't care what conventional wisdom says I don't care conventional wisdom would have had us in a second year of president Hillary Rodham Clinton that's what conventional wisdom says okay\nAnd we saw how that one played out so again never before have I distrust the polls as much as I distrust and now the media is so biased they couldn't they couldn't print the truth with regards to anything Donald Trump related and air or by default the Republican Party that he leads\nIf they want it to the couldn't they couldn't possibly do it\nBut here you have this this this this president and he's willing to take this on with the midterms right around the corner rather than talk nice and and and don't want to be seen as as coming against women and children fleeing oppression who wants to do that what did she do he says excuse me\nNo no no we're a sovereign country and Mexico if you don't do something I'm gonna I'm gonna hit you where it hurts in the pockets with this new trade deal with me\nAnd then to the other countries I'm going to strip you of your money to how 'bout that Honduras Guatemala why don't you get control of your your your population why don't you do something about this\nAnd guess what they're still out of this show there are still camped out on that bridge him that he called a ... leading to make us so we'll we'll see what happens we'll see what takes place here but I don't think they're going to make it to the board and that's my prediction\nBut this was a stunt and all we see a stunts and so the latest stunt another stunts that that we have seen come out and this week\nJust in time for election season you know these are these October surprise is there's no accident about this is the latest Robert Mueller fake indictment\nAnd we're gonna we're gonna go into detail about this but the one thing I wanted to to to make note of and then I'll take calls a call\nIs that\nThis violates the OJ practice remember what we've heard time and again and remember about James told me he violated the OJ practice but then of course\nAfter things started to be uncovered we found out he did it to protect your ... which is exactly what I said at the time that's what I said I said no James Comey is doing this to he did this to protect\nHillary Rodham didn't have a choice because when wieners laptop got discovered\nThey were in a pickle and then sure enough that's exactly what what what happened to know James told me he he rushed through this thing to get it out in July so that she can be exonerated on July for her independence day that's the day he chose to to liberate Hillary Clinton from her crimes\nAnd then of course they just sat on the winner fame when that took place in September so no they didn't violate the OJ practice they had to continually said banned in part because they were trying to support this fraud of a woman this criminal Hillary Rodham Clinton\nThat's what happened there with James Comey but it is against the OJ practice to look like they're meddling by issuing indictments or doing that kind of stuff in the lead up to any kind of a lecture and yet lo and behold what do we have from Robert Mueller no not his grand\nHis grand findings on the whole Trump collusion narrative which we know the politics of who wins this November is going to determine what's in that I guarantee you I guarantee it\nThat's why they're not going to release it till after the election\nBut what did he do this weekend\nAnother Russian has been indicted so we'll get to all that in a second but I just want you to keep in mind he is violating the department of justice longstanding practice by issuing this ridiculous indictment\nBecause they don't they just want the story Russian indicted for meddling in elections that's all they want they want the headlines they want the narrative they know again that the average person who already have Donald Trump is made up their mind it's just got to foment their rage and they're hoping this leads to them going to the polls and\nVoting against Donald Trump so that's why Robert Mueller did what he did in this ridiculous a deal Jay indictment which we won't discuss\nBut after I take pause called Paul you're on the air go\nYeah I did a little bit of investigation work when I was in the navy or you know where you really don't need a wall down there we spent five percent of our money that we get the central\nAnd South America we could have agents down they're finding out exactly who's financing a oh if unrest and uh it wouldn't be such a simple matter the federal government it got\nSo many people in so much into this we know all this stuff ordinary if we really wanted to well you know you know it was for us back\nBack a few years ago when we try to find out how Israel got the atomic bomb from us yeah it took us about forty eight hours in the U.S says liberty that there was sunk over there\nOr shot up very badly it took us about eight hours to find out exactly what would happen but the newspapers for some reason or anti American\nAnd they will not tell the fall and you're in Tucson and seems like you're the only one on on the uh in the news programming that was going to do what's going on\nWhy appreciate that Paul or to your to your a major point\nDo you honestly and I'm going to ask a question here or do you honestly think that we don't know who's behind these things see I think we do and and that's the problem\nWe have people elements with in our own government who hate this country and are want this country to lose its sovereignty they do they're bunch of global is they are especially in happening the state department but we see them in action in the department of justice and the FBI or the CIA loaded with these global is I guarantee that\nSo I mean I think we do probably know who's behind it not just President Trump no no no because that would that would have to be who's keeping the information from him because he only knows he only knows what he's told the president only knows what his intelligence agencies I tell him and we have proof positive and we're gonna discuss it a little bit more\nOf the and later in the show we have proof positive though that the FBI and the OJ is totally against Donald Trump I mean loaded with people opposed to this president so\nUnder under committing sedition\nBeyond the OJ is totally against Donald Trump I mean loaded with people opposed to this president so\nAnd they're committing rape and murder or Justice Department will not do anything about it or nothing Trump couldn't tell them to do something about it if you really want to put his foot down well the\nProblem there is the politics of it the problem there is Jeff Sessions and I that's why again that's another issue in this election\nBecause if Trump gets the the the power political power that I'm hoping he gets in the Senate and in the house with Republican I guarantee you I in fact it may happen one way or the other but I guarantee you if that happens sessions has gone he's going to fire Jeff Sessions\nAnd he will get somebody else but there's a lot of other issues to to to look at with regards to I I Know that you and myself and other people we want to see justice\nBut the problem is is as we also remember with regards to this particular instance we had our our allies Australia and the and the u._k. government they had officials who were involved in this plot and so now you have a very thorny issue about do your throat actual\nAllies under the bus what how does this play in the long run so do you and I want to see all these people go to prison the fact of the matter is is when Trump has the power I think that there will be than a justice brought to a few but it's gonna it's gonna be a backstop of sorts\nBecause it's going to not be able to touch certain a certain element and that's unfortunate\nAnd I the only way to ultimately get their Paul if they have a total clean out and buy cleaner I mean by electing actual staunch conservatives and people who actually believe",
