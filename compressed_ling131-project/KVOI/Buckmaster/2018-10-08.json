USA Today I Believe it appeared in the New York times\nAnd it I'm immediately rang bells with me it's the headline is America needs a war on waste and do we ever\nAnd Adam I Angie ... has put together together with Dr Tom Coburn who's been a friend of the show in the past when he was a senator from Oklahoma\nOr a list of some of the most outrageous federal government wastes and and it's tough to know where to begin a Adam do you have a personal favorite of all these wasted government programs wasteful government programs at U. of spotlight as\nWell Michael thank you very much for our interests that are in our work and open the books dot com I think my favorite is that there are literally is a federal grant for everybody in this country and in fact every single year the federal government doled out six hundred billion dollars worth of grants\nAnd if you're a prostitute and California one point four million dollars funded sex education for California prostitutes who could probably teach the glass\nOkay now which which way which sheds department of government or handles the a sex ed for California prostitutes\nThat's health and Human Services [laughter] that's it they have a different direction of Human Services [laughter] right\nUm so what what is the point how did they just how much money for sex ed for the prostitutes\nWell probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar\nOnly now overall\nEvery year ha Jeff Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective US military every year at the department of defense their total budget is six hundred million dollars\nWow wow a at ... it in terms of what you were talking about was open the books dot com you have a a basic approach which is the\nTransparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell that's that's the plan on the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should posts all White House expenditures\nThat spending is a crisis the president can take this three pronged approach and he should lead by example issued posts all White House expenditures and then step to cut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report for the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff at President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't get that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars floated or Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael that the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world",
