Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people have big in the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump and I think that Trump's anthrax as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base\nBut Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of a left their complete disregard for normal procedure\nAnd the rule of law and I think that at best that showed the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in violating norms and politics\nAnd at worst almost extra constitutional so I think that\n... managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to October surprise on their feet never blow up in their face\nDot com\nBut acts Arizona ballgame as Saturday

has engaged though to Michael Medvedev dot com click on the banner for the alliance defending freedom or Coleman toll free eight six six nine five four three three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four three three eight eight back with John Fund a John is the\nNational affairs columnist for National Review he worked for more than Twenty years for Wall Street journal and a is also a contributor at Fox News we're talking\nAbout the the upcoming elections ... one of those things and and again you made this observation before\nJohn we're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot ah but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them are so confusing to most people my\nStrong gas is that most Americans most Americans I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative\nIn the house of representatives actually is couldn't given ... so what do we do about that or just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage when Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the community shake hands and become well known so while not everyone knows who their congressmen as a lot of people in the middle the independent voters or if they met their congressmen or their gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of the congressman's office\nThey liked the congressman and the the the job of a congressman is two fold if to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience if the balancing act and ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them\nSadly the vast majority of people don't vote well about half the people will not vote in the selection\nThose who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you will have some people will say well even though I disagree with my congressman or woman I like what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same happening if you ask people in general do things that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress an institution\nThat then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith who was ... I represent my district as as it happens\nSo what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy it says the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools their medical care anything else\nIs that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter]\nIn an island of dysfunction and the wealthy and discovers in public\nAnd keep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say\nYeah but I Am really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked ... or shaking his hand or helped me out and that's why in general you never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me at the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nBut the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... and I are more\nEmpty seats than in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because it an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party straight party line\nSo I'm\nIn in terms of I Know that the\nRepublicans have good chances of knocking on some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks the campaign in order to try to hold onto the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace and frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one to\nThe economy is really good and that's not an accident or bronco Palmer back Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats to take over Congress and the third is you know\nAh there's some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law it's proven by Kavanaugh and to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration\nThis is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election and at the same time the Democrats are completely silent\nOr a lecture and at the same time the Democrats are completely from I've got a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen a which the wall Street Journal is written about in the Daily Beast has written about that this really started uh as as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras\nAnd to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of on the door and dirty tricks campaigning doesn't seem a good idea\n\nJon ... of the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and like your cricket fire cricket\nWell exactly what I have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic adds up each or health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nAnd uh he was active in America first committee but a ... there's a good terrific piece actually about Trump is not an isolationist\nHe's not somebody who wants to withdraw American power from the world and as a matter of fact we just had pretty impressive chosen power we sent\n'em ... an aircraft carrier\nUp into the Baltic Sea I think for the first time in many many years to a little show a power to Russian we've sent\nA ship's of our navy or close to China to indicate we're not going to be ... by them so look this all has to be taken in context and meanwhile a a quick word from relief factor this came in from Melinda\n... and again let call everybody is so polite time didn't and helpful and most of all it's helped me so much and name with swelling a lot\nAnd that it's all gone away and my legs happening every night terribly and then it's gone away and other things like that in my shoulders and it's gone away\nOkay wouldn't it be worth it uh Ninety five cents a day if you could have that kind of experience that Linda described try yourself she talks about the team being great this is a great product from great people relief factor dot com that's relief factor\nDot a meanwhile I'm a political
