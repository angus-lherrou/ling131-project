I'm sure he came out of this I'm annoyed and probably annoyed agreed to do it\nBecause what so peculiar about this and and honestly you can go back and you can look at every single interview the bronco bomb and did very much including the interviews the bronco bonded to his credit with Bill O'Reilly\nAnd he did and Bill O'Reilly was not a fan of President Obama he ripped him up and down and sideways but when he spoke to Obama he was eager to be in the president's good graces and I think they have some that have a relationship\nThat wasn't so much true with Lesley Stahl of sixty minutes who who clearly made it very clear while she was speaking to them she didn't respect President Trump\nAnd uh I look I\n... is this the end of the world the fact that President Trump has a bad relationship with CBS\nI I think it's it's it's not necessarily the end of the world but uh they got into discussing the future of Jeff Sessions which suddenly is a matter of grave concern to establish a media all over the country what about\nThe attorney general Jeff Sessions well we'll see what happens come to terms but\nBut everybody thinks he was appointed that requires some self and letting people think I was right and I was very disappointed why should have recused himself very disappointed I enlisted what can I assume he's gone you know you can't show like well you [noise] um\nWell you flash\nYou will not shut down the ... ... I don't play anything\nBut I have no intention of doing that I think it's a very unfair have education because there was no collusion of any kind in ... I don't want to pledge why should I pledge to you if I pledge pledge not to play she was like wow I have no intention of us\nOkay look at it it it's it's a reasonable distinction and and by the way of course it would be a tremendous disaster iffy shut down the more investigation\nBut he's right to say I'm not going to pledge not to shut it down is it possible that the ... step over the line at some point so clearly or that would be exposed at some point so clearly\nThat he would have a justification to stop the investigation it's very unlikely because Bob Mueller is their own professional and I think patriotic\nBut ah is is there something wrong with President Trump's answer\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six chat in Chester, Pennsylvania you're on the ... that show\nUh yeah I just think it's a little hypocritical of the media it's a really kind of go after ... after Trump and accused him\nA used at least the Russia's meddling in the election I mean it's naive to think that the United states has not had an added toppling of any government and the patch or even having any kind of imports through the intelligence agencies just to try to sway elections or to influence our one way or another\nYeah so I mean in other words the United states is a a world power that has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign\nGovernments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role on I Know that very controversial but what does that have to do this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests\nUh we we oppose Russia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop it [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to watch or morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just just to think that there are not the elements that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries\nOf course there are governments that are trying to do it but I and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia dead\nWhich is why I Do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chopping them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did uh\nAnd the entire the entire thing is on corroborated at some substantial and where I Do think most Americans can agree or should agree\nIs treating her as some kind of holy martyr who can be questioned it at all I agree with you it's wrong to take that point of
