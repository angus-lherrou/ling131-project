F a you acts of course and means phony false like people talk about food pearls only pearls their imitation so this was before President Trump started with a book on a stuff\nTheir number of people in writing including me who use the term to describe Elizabeth Warren as ... Khan is right get it as in ... it sounds like Pocahontas but its FAU accident and honest and I guess President Trump must have heard that and he dropped the French part and just\nMade it Pocahontas in any event is why is it a racial slur\nRedskins is uh I I understand that can be a racial slur we won't get into that issue ... but I'm sure we will at some point certainly if the Democrats win the house um she uh uh there's a second clip of course in powers on CNN here she is\nI think it would have been better if she would have just originally said you know what family lore and this is what I thought made a mistake on you know Michael said actually I don't think she probably has much more\nYou know of this this um you know in her DNA than most Americans so just you know we all histories in our families and you say I I heard it wrong and said she said something about her grandfather great grandfather having high cheekbones which is a racist stereotype and so I think she actually has legitimately handled the sadly\nDonald Trump ... that's not his motivation is not about he cares about her misappropriating culture he's just acting godly and making racist attacks\nWhy it why is it a racist attack I I don't see that I don't get I think it's an attack on a political opponent and yes the president does a lot of it um [noise] let's uh go to Pam in ...

what he said\nLet me play ... he he oh what's her that million dollar let Pam way I Am ... let me let\nMe play it for you okay I just want to be fair here\nListen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offer to Elizabeth Warren\nIf you take the test of the shows you're here you're [noise]\nOkay if it shows you are an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country\nThat would accept her as an Indian based upon this CNA tested chose that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was an Indian that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm Trump your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really has and I mean you guys I I'm I'm just\nSo I Would have let me let me let you let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that it is honorable a for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a\nOr Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I ... it was trivial and he shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called the doctor for it doesn't matter and she was lying or not and we and we want it that's all he cares about winning he didn't care who he dumps on\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on this show I I think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who was made accusations that intimate kind against him\nTo attacker is for states to put that in a tweet today\nWhen I care about is the direction the country is going and frankly there are much higher number of people who believed today that America is going in the right direction and I wish President Trump would capitalize on that and um maybe engage in a little bit fewer Twitter aside shows I think that would help\nUm meanwhile quick word from relief factor this came in from a Janice\nHow skeptical at first but because of the pain that I

look\nOne of the things that I I found on illuminating and I appreciate the call from a our last caller in Columbus I Believe was or was he basically cared about Trump the person\nIn one of the things that I think is terribly wrong with our politics is\nFocusing everything on either appraising and the door ring and are applauding and I'm backing and cheering for President Trump or completely obsessing on he's the worst things ever happen and he's describes the presidency and he's a terrible person\nAnd uh I Can't stand anything he says ... ... is one of the other like there's nowhere in between and and most human beings and certainly most politicians\nAre not all evil or all\nGood there imperfect like all of us and\nThe point about this election is it's really not about Trump I Know he says it is but he's wrong it's about Republicans in Congress\nMost of whom are are dedicated and decent public servants and deserve a vote of confidence only mentioned the word here about Dean Heller who's engaged in a really tight race in Nevada\nAnd it's one of the races that will determine control of the U.S Senate dean has been an an exemplary\nPublic servant about whom there's never been a whisper scandal and\nThere are people like that around the country\nWho are deserving of support people have done a very good job for the people they represent\nAndrew eminently deserves support people like a colonel\nMix Sally in Arizona we talked about before public servants who are patriotic who are not part of any\nCalled forty five it's been called culture the forty fifth president President Trump deserves applause and support and backing when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does\nBut the idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis and\nYou have Democrats now who have promised that if they take the house they're going to try to\nAnd and you have Democrats now who have promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump they're gonna try don't preach justice Kavanaugh aren't really\nThat helps the country\nHow\nIt doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in

Indian yeah\nShe was one one thousand twenty fourth answer should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm I'm sure you've done the math that the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now in the\nURL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this is something you'll find out about the ... movie uh they used to count someone who is Jewish who was eligible for execution and liquidation if you had one\nSixteenth a Jewish background now she doesn't close to that\nOne sixteenth Jewish background means what does it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in
