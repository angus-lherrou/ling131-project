show are joined by Ralph Nader he is the author of a new book or that has nothing to offend just about anybody I it is called to the rampart how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it isn't too late to reverse course\nI'm first before we get to the issue of the electoral college Ralph Nader yeah you're very harsh to President Obama and President Clinton both of whom are heroes to a lot of people on the list\nOf what was the biggest failing you found in the Obama administration what do you have most against it\nIt was called empire stunted George Bush's attacks drone attacks virtual forces international federal starches\nYou toppled the Libyan regime it's incredible cast of this six\nAfrican countries once Hillary's war he overrode secretary of Defense Gates who was opposed it he said look you toppled Gadhafi was planes started to play ball with western countries and contracts companies and then you have a tribal society you're gonna get civil war and that's what happened\nAnd of course he didn't really get us out of Afghanistan the way you said he wanted to a broader military budget for any and I think back and Rick Perry in America back home which he promised to do\nWith our response or they talk a good Clinton talked to him but he stands for her personal Mr Trump versus women or he got away with Clinton\nAnd so you know Trump is watching this he's watching watching what these presidents are getting away with\nAnd he's an expert and getting away with everything and he said I I can run for president and win\nOkay what uh what about uh you you basically charging the book that you think that both Obama and Clinton not to mention President Bush and President Trump or in the pocket of Wall Street would that be saying too harshly\n[noise] yeah well once we get more money to President Obama in two thousand ain't than any Republican candidate has ever see\nRight they gave them a lot more to Obama than to Mitt Romney or or or to John McCain yeah\nThe question was soft on Wall street they talked to a good game but\nYou know nobody wants to do for two thousand two thousand nine I mean this is on the savings and loan Twenty years on good business people were prosecuted and convicted and sent to jail so\nYou can see where the trend is you know I'd give people hope because and paying twenty five to forty eight oh Michael\nI have some of the citizenry ringing centers and represent back to the citizens on on meeting with the citizens own agenda and the public auditorium like a school on time and I write at all in this book to ramp part\nI don't care if you're a liberal conservative when you're working and Iran have family back home on a lot of the same thing you want safe I don't want clean air clean water you want decent school you want peace and public facilities\nIf you want for properly liable and that's where it can go next month to vote your conscience around your party\nYou want your believes for better or America as it relates to working group working ranch or family regardless of conservative or liberal\nOkay you're also a big advocate for abolishing the electoral college of the reason that will never happen and you know this is because you need the approval of three quarters of the state legislatures\nRight now we have sixteen states in the country that have five electoral votes or less\nThose are states that will never ever be visited um if a if you make it a population only the popular vote only so where are you going to get states like Idaho on the one hand or Hawaii on the other hand\nTo vote from limiting their own influence and their own safety though and electing a president\nMichel\n... it's not a constitutional amendment right to get a call ... ...\nBut under the constitution states have the authority to set the rules of the election and what's going on now is what's called national popular vote dot com stung by a businessman steep Silverstein the San Francisco\nHe hired a few years ago six fulltime lobbyists went out around the country\nAnd the Oregon and California, Maryland kinetic\nPark Illinois and in our state compact and he's up to a hundred and Seventy two electoral votes ... gets to two hundred and Seventy and\nThrow the electoral college votes to whoever wins the national popular vote as a presidential candidate\nAnd he's up to a hundred and something to turn out and then from Democrats who wants to presidential elections two thousand two thousand sixteen when they won the popular twice and lost electoral college vote or not even support in\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here with the electoral compact and I am aware of it but part of what that means is that\nThe uh the stage the various states to sign onto it\nOr would be pledged to actually give all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant\nWhich still exists but to be in vain naturalized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to the bank idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue states very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative state\nYeah next time Republicans won the popular vote for president electoral college vote when you get the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who I've ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican or and John's on the end up in\nTwo thousand four\nBecause of carrying guns sixty thousand more votes and were carrying Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even though we're got more votes\nThat's true that's a real danger I I like the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before\nOf everybody going to the Nebraska main system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered apportion men of congressional districts what do you think about that you know in Ventura [laughter]\nUm [laughter] I mean when you're coming [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes wasn't a disaster some of us think President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of his excess he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader has enjoyed great success with his literary legal and even some political endeavors his new book is called\nRecord makes it perfectly clear the capital punishment in our state has been imposed an arbitrary and racially biased manner is equally an equally applied and serves no criminal justice goal\nWrote the governor okay then get the people to agree and get legislation passed they had been trying to get legislation passed in the state legislature but it hasn't gone through\nDespite democratic control of both houses we will get back to that issue and just a moment a quick word from relief factor Wayne in Kansas writes in I'm proof positive that really factor works I've suffered from lower back pain for years due to having played
