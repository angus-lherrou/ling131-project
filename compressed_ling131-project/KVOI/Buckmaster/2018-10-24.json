Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there is a statement from Jeff Zucker who's president of CNN\nAnd he says this statement there is a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension event\nOkay that that again is an attempt\nBefore anything knows anything anybody knows anything about the shooter to basically blamed the White House and blame White House rhetoric for these attacks now if these attacks were inspired by President Trump's hatred of the media wouldn't you expect\nMedia companies to have been prominently targeted you say well CNN was well no it wasn't that package that was delivered a CNN and the name on it of John Brennan the former CIA director has been very very critical of President Trump remembered President Trump removed his security clearance\nAnd a yes or that John Brennan's name spelled wrong but it was addressed John Brennan care of CNN\n[noise] it or to the very best of my knowledge there is no report yet of any\nOther media company and the San Diego union an evening Tribune it apparently it was just the same building they were in the thing was in the mail room it was addressed that they think though that has not been confirmed yet either\nTo senator Kamala Harris who has an office in the same building of this ... it seems to me um the the idea it's similar to the stupidity of suggesting that somehow by President Trump's\nIntent Britain foolish criticism of the media and I think it is foolish and stupid and wrong but equating that with the cars she'll be murder\nAnd really you want to show me that ... I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ... oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard them attacking the lines thinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something no of course he didn't ... doesn't didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know saw him on a ... was actually directly responsibly probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing feud with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nGo to um Jonathan Berman who is in America news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN Uday with Alex and come out on CNN he's a ...\nAnd currently the co anchor CNN Uday with Alex income rod on CNN he's a\nRegular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\n\nIt couldn't have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and\nI see okay so nobody knows who that package was sent it but if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily a media\nFigure um meanwhile uh the Dow is down sharply\nSays technology stocks led the market deeper into the red on week earnings reports from a TNT in Texas Instruments\nFigured out who email who mailed a letter with white powder drew the White House to do to Congress to other people [noise] somebody I physically take that into a post office the mail it they're they're going to get caught\nI think you're entirely correct I appreciate your call very much Tommy quick word from relief factor this came in from Sherry\n... husband was researching on the Internet of ways to ease might paint in both of my head and it was at a point where I couldn't even hardly walk so we ordered it and it took about states five days of being on it oh my gosh\nI I don't even feel like I have any problems whatsoever I think with all of my heart this product is amazing and I so so thankful\nOkay uh you will be thankful to because relief factor kicks in\nIn just five or six days you feel a real difference the pain is reduced sometimes entirely eliminated and certainly at the end of three weeks more than Seventy percent of people are so gratified with the impact of taking relief factor I've just Nineteen Ninety five for the first three weeks by the way they're so satisfied and gratified by taking really factor\nThat more than Seventy percent end up going getting more go to release factor dot com that's relief factor dot com nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world to gain\nMeanwhile what do people have to gain by praising the caravan will get to that coming up on them at that you\nMight feel is now offering a special deal by one get one free go might be a little dog dog usually prohibit\nThe timing is everything in the gold and silver markets and it's true it's Michael Medicare for American federal rare coin and billion although you can buy at the right time if you buy the wrong coins\nWell you may not make a profit when gold was four hundred dollars announcement people were talked into buying five dollar ten dollar and twenty dollar gold coins now unfortunately most of the people who bought the so called semi new ms ... coins like the twenty dollar St gardens and liberty had gold mines\nThey haven't broken even yet on their investment now it's incredible given the gold has risen approximately three hundred percent since then so wall timing is everything if you buy the wrong coins\nThe timing doesn't matter that much having a dealer who cares about positioning you in the right types of coins or bullying will mean more to your portfolio than anything else my experience has shown me that and that's why I only deal with Nick ... and the American federal team whether you're buying or selling call American federal rare coin and bullying Paul toll free\nEight hundred to two one seven

we've\nTalked about and then you can they should make the condition that we often get you know we have an extensive amount you can enjoy many classical or change from ... to ... to you know we also have anyone to choose from and because of ... the first place that's the key that we offer over one hundred different price again\nIn your family to have lunch or dinner with my family\nAnd then you ... where I live in that age the dot com [noise]\nThat's a common misconception [noise]\nBattles are one within [noise]\nIn that place were promises for Jeff [noise]\nPromises to once\nFrom two one\nLittle ... was a freedom your military talk radio show every Saturday Night when am ten thirty DVR while less than one percent of Americans ever served in the military nearly every one of us know someone who is serving poor has served to learn more about the British\nMilitary in the world War II veteran news joined me for front was if we do on a um ... have you on Saturday Night from nine eleven on have you align the voice\n[noise]\nBlurry older shining a bright wider ... do we do you afternoons five your weight on June thirty yard billboard huge dogs news and intelligent tall [noise]\n\nAnd on the Michael Mann that show the tendency to demonize everything about the president makes it more difficult\nTo\nI think look with any kind of sense of balance or fairness or open mindedness is at an all in areas where maybe there could be some valid criticism and no I Do not think that President Trump is the first man to ever hold the highest office in the land\nTo execute his job one hundred percent perfectly\nWithout ... or ... a one eight hundred Ninety five five Seventeen Seventy six however when uh people like Senator Kamala Harris the Democrat junior\nSenator from uh California the senior senator from California who's about to get reelected by the way is very very very very senior it's eighty five year old\nI'm Dianne Feinstein so this dynamic duo um basically things\nNot the Trump can do no wrong of course they think Trump can do no right and er here is Camelot Harris giving you her idea\nOf what America is all about and how that regards\nThe caravan which has now said to be down a little bit to six thousand people who are marching toward our border here senator Harris'\nLeave our [laughter] our strength and all this and that we are eight eight eight eight tolerant country\nWe're welcoming and lived near our\nCountry what our country want one of our country want they want leaders were focused on the challenges that they\nLike and they don't they don't pay the bills by the end of the month [laughter] family every year and that's what people want to\nOkay not villa find somebody but has she answered the question about what should be done when the caravan comes to the borders of the United states\nAnd and this is where the Democrats fail completely because they have nothing to say about it in other words\nIt's least President Trump has a virtue of cat clarity here he does not want some kind of mass entry into the United states and by the way we can all I think relax a little bit there's an interesting piece in the\nLos Angeles times about the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration\nAnd it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWhat are the last three years including last year as the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen people come here\nIn terms of uh applying for asylum\nIn terms of uh applying for asylum between the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum are turned back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stomp granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband you probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states and that seems to me is reasonable enough uh\nLet us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nMike I'm yeah I I just find that you know disheartening and an unbelievable how the button paid
