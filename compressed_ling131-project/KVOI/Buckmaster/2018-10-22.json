the author of a powerful piece about kicking the marijuana habit to questions and we'll get onto our calls Neal you a question number one is\nObviously you you wrote so beautifully frankly as the world's greatest living American writer um\nHe was so beautifully about what marijuana meant to you and how important it wants to you or it's obviously an empty place in your life where you no longer smoke and haven't for a year almost a year and have you filled up that empty place with something else\nWell you know I'm doing pretty much the same stuff I was doing when I was high I still I I go into the movies or watching TV and hanging out with my family reading books doing yoga or exercising walking my dog I've just do get sober\nAnd uh and in some ways it makes things a little more boring

or ... or\nI wouldn't I wouldn't say that I had a little I had a period after I quit a weed where I uh I was I was playing a lot of poker um\nStuff that is also addicted\nAnd I felt a little bank roll and then I lost the bank roll than I thought I was playing for free and some of that but I I had to back off of that because because that that kind of became all consuming as well I mean I had this big wide and twenty Seventeen because my mother died very suddenly\nThen I watched it happen and it was very traumatic and so the following nine months were just a you know I dealt with the group or did a lot of drugs\nAnd the way I did a lot of gambling and it just was not good and so yeah I was but once I sort of move poker into the background and I I'd say that I've replaced it with um\nYou know just a a filled up with books and movies and music and um you know other ... as as they say and in the twelve step program you know our circle activities things that that are are fun and healthy that don't have to do with your addiction\nAnd you have a is your son allies are you still fourteen he's fifty almost sixty he's sixteen okay because I think you've got a freshman up your website

that you have a personality disorder where you need something to make yourself strong one and in retrospect you're a strong all along and you didn't need to do that\nSo I don't think just to marijuana as a personality\nOr Neal yeah I mean that that's the thing about addiction right it's like it it emerges as a response to some sort of drama\nUh which create character flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them yeah alcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and\nSo yeah I mean that's an absolutely accurate
