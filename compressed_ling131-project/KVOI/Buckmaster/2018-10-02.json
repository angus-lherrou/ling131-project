I mean listen he's but you can't guarantee things that other people will do he knows Jeff Flake I don't ... I Know I Know sometimes I Know people by what they say and what they do and that gives me a pretty good um\nRadar as to how to feel about them there is a rampant and very appropriate cynicism about Jeff Flake and view of his antics of lake of late\nBut his friend John Fund says look I Know Jeff and if there's not a any disqualifying crazy new thing and the FBI report that ah that Jeff uh will not screw us here\nSo I'm going to be momentarily comforted by that's a good to defer to Mr funds familiarity with the subject at hand ah but can I be forgiven if my bottom line position is I'll believe it\nWhen I see it much funds testimony also is that the real problem could be Lisa Murkowski\nThat uh that does resonate this is an interesting one uh Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins these are these pro choice women Republicans are always an interesting uh uh an an interesting file of of ah of political a political life\nI I've noticed something Susan Collins a lot more vocal you see her you know getting badgered at the airport a lot more often and actually talking to reporters and I think there is a shred of of decency and decorum to Susan Collins and that doesn't mean that I Know Jeff Flake lacks that\nOr that I Know Lisa Murkowski lax yet but I'm I feel pretty good uh Susan Collins who is willing to vote for him before all of this came about was leaning in telegraphing voting for him before all\nOf this smear campaign began so I just find no reason for her to change your vote there's really no reason for anybody to change a vote but ... you know that doesn't mean that everybody uses my logic that everybody is a scene things through a a clear lead\nA if Lisa Murkowski you know has some bug working somewhere other than some\nSome stripe that that does not allow her to to see her way forward to do what the vast majority of Republican voters in Alaska want\nIf she's just in the mood to to flip the burned to them\nUh then then maybe she'll do it now here's the thing if John Fund is right about Jeff Flake and if Susan Collins\nIf my gut is right about Susan Collins than ms Murkowski\nCan go do what ever she wishes because we don't need her\nBecause we can lose precisely one Republican one\nBecause if we it's fifty one forty nine if you lose one at fifty fifty and then uh\nThen Mike Pence becomes my favorite vice president ever and that's pretty tall order 'cause right now in the clubhouse leaders Dick Cheney if he's so anyway this could all go in a in a wide variety of\nWays um [noise] but the issue is somehow in complete without having Hillary Clinton way in [laughter]\nI Know that's just provable he falls there ... ... ... why the world is Hillary Clinton me to weigh in on anything anymore I've seen her favorability rating according to Gallup it remains in an all time low of thirty six percent\nOh by God sixty percent had an unfavorable opinion and four percent had no opinion who those people I'd like to talk to someone who has no opinion about Hillary Clinton [laughter] currently living on Mars or something I don't know uh the Gallup\nHas polled Hillary's favorability going all the way back\nTo Nineteen Ninety two and now it's thirty six percent that's an all time low where was it on the eve of the twenty sixteen election you may ask forty three so it's it's been a rough couple of years\nIt's been a rough couple of years so hey let's get let's let's give the woman some radio time so she's at this thing called the Atlantic festival I don't even do that is and there's a moderator and they're talking to her and the subject or ride is where Brett Kavanaugh\nIn in his um moment before the this long moment for the Senate Judiciary committee talked about how the the the tormented that he was experiencing\nHad they carry the dint of ... of just long standing Democrat grudges so here's Hillary having a good cackle about that rural it\nBrett Kavanaugh a said that the quote political his job and quote a directed at him a was being done on behalf\nOf the Clintons among other people your response [laughter]\n\nReally yeah is there a lot of laughter um I wasn't watching when he said that I was having to be somewhere else and away from it to be a and even my phone and so I heard about it later and you know look\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a\nYou know unconvincing presentation on and I I told someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit I'm\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I guess I mean it is back at Yale that yeah well even before in high school apparently um\nSo I I I don't you know look I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are in politics upon\nThem um but I think\nFor anyone who believe there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want\nJudges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs and defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about right\nDo tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because\nFairness ... exude from his every judicial pour it it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of\nFairness basic fairness basic decency so that when those\nIt's basic decency so that when those concepts\nAre dashed against the rocks or those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats is Democrat tour mentors and that is exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone would have\nTo sit on national TV and imagine the woman you
