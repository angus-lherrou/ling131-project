I can I can win them either or they're already in my camp\nTo to to get the wherewithal to actually engage and\nThere's just no excuse in my opinion it's your civic duty it's a part of the deal and if we want to see the change\nThen we we got to vote in every election I mean every single election school board included or you want to see better school boards you you got to get engaged in that fight to you can't just leave that to to the to the people that I mean that's how ... got into power I mean that's how he did it he took over the the the the ... borders to us and we all see what a disaster to us DSL um\nUh that's really the best I can say I on another um thing my mother actually was talking about this today and you notice she makes a good point is if you're really active\nAnd say you're retired or are you looking for stuff to do with your active in politics become a precinct ... you can help get a a good candidates out there and promoted and stuff like that you have a lot more\nOf a good candidates out there and promoted and stuff like that you have a lot more time than somebody that's working a job or something but either way\nYou you got to get engaged or on the very local level I N and stop just thinking presidents stop just thinking state stopped just thinking governor ... I mean that the if you want to win your city this is how you do it or ... or you just sleep you just play a lot um habit\nWell again I'm not going to go anywhere I mean and you know at least not yet this is my home it's been my home for my whole life and so that's really the only way to do it Mike so\nYeah so I went to like you know any any proposition undeveloped and also found that there is no way\nOh I don't blame you I I'm pretty much nay until I see otherwise that's I I\nI don't understand the logic will will bring the will get rid of the bus to bring the new bones in and\nI I I don't know if you've been doing this thing is you sit up and see where we're where we're going to go with that no I mean ... and and\nBeing absolutely condescending to us and then of course we're comments on abortion which I'll get you in a second but I I have I I see it on Facebook I have these you know Facebook friends who are\nSeriously considering a sitting this one out because a a march summit Sally she's just a rhino all okay so what is she is what if I just surrender that argument completely and and I will tend to agree that she's a somewhat moderate candidate\nSo what so what\nThis is who your other option is\nAnd yet they wrap it in some kind of self righteous sense of morality and and and doing the good seen by not choosing one or the other\nI write it down there is there is no safe haven anymore we have one party the Democrat national party who has completely gone off the reservation or right and we have been through this had nothing more than a covered a little bit more later on in the show uh uh some of the other comments have been made by national political leaders on the Democrats are left\nBut here you have this woman in our state saying vote for me vote for me and yet you still have people ... and then and then it baffles me that you also have people who suggest that vote from Sally somehow the same as a vote for this woman I mean it's just it blows my mind especially when you see something like this\nEspecially when you see these kinds of comments and I\nAnd I see I lost ... came back on the year I Will get you wreck in a second\nAnd that brings me to the other comment that she made I mean did you did not not not just the condescension in her comments and everything else and mocking you and I but what she said about the ... the unborn child again I'm very passionate about this issue I don't care where anybody else stands on this issue um I I'm an extremely passionate about life All right\nAnd that off handed way she remark about this or I remember she said this in the in the in the video\nThat women are because of cap and because of what we did hear in this day women are being forced\nTo listen to the heartbeat of the fetus or forced to look at ... ... oh yeah God Forbid\nThat we make you consider the human cost of an abortion before you go in there and have them forcibly remove a child bit by bit God Forbid we do that oh she were so cruel in the state of Arizona there's another she she got an added to her list\nShe's an abomination this woman\nAn absolute and utter abomination and if you're considering that there is some kind of moral equivalence between her\nAnd mark MacPhail you got serious issues you got serious issues that's all I can say about it\nYou might disagree with me on that but be my guest and one other call these ... these things fetuses as well as just Latin for baby\nThat's all it is but of course they expect everybody else who speaks English when you call the feet if you just think it's you know bought a cell that they they they try to divorce it for me it's humanity but there's no way they're divorced in front of humanity because in Latin world were fetus derives from its referencing\nIt's humanity only your endurance with the divorce rate of divorce the term from its humanity\nI mean this woman is so sick I I I cannot even imagine anybody voting for this woman and thinking that they're doing a good thing and they're sticking it to the GOP get us a better candidate up there you want better candidates get better candidates in the primaries that's where you find them\nWhen you get to this this playing field there is that clear in sharp contrast and\nThat video latest bears so I don't want to hear from anybody who's out there talking about how\nThey're they're somehow guarding themselves in there somehow I pay a paragon of moral virtue in the political world because they're not going to vote for either one or even worse they're going to vote for cinema to teach that he'll be a lesson on believable Rick I'm going to go to you man you're on the air\nHey Hey Joe so yeah I generally agree with\nEverything you say basically I mean I'm I'm I'm On the same mindset however I think he loved his name your your radio program yeah yeah instead of common sense with Joseph, Oregon ... you should all it angry high blood pressure rat with Joseph mark and oh really\nAt that I mean that fits better you know oh God I mean I I generally agree with what you're saying it's just like nonstop granting in rural\nRural written it gets cold it at our records it's called passion my friend do you have a question if you're here that do you have that out\nAre ready for anybody else in it there in New York you know you're taking my call it out for which I'm eternally grateful I just thought I'd mention that I listen to ... twenty four seven grand up bank whenever whenever your show is art\nI'm always impressed I you're not your passion yet but also up it's basically just one myth basically going nuts about these issues well\nThat's it's my talk show I mean I'm supposed to have something to say if I just sat here and it was dead air and waited for you to call in Iraq we wouldn't have a show thanks for going into and thanks for listening limb we're going to go to you\nThen you're on the air\nAnd fire because he I Know you have the passion I feel the same way that you do that the unborn children in fact it's interesting that the\nWhat happened to Lynn what\nHappened to him I don't know like all difficulties Lynn Boehner's been acting up and I would call back and we'll we'll take a child in the meantime let's go to John John you're on your mind to go\nThere for ... so we may have another problem ladies and gentlemen there's got to be a bad day and Rick but for me is my brother from the mother and have the same as me but\nI mean do you say you started calling people sheep and minute ago right well yeah you can follow an an idea that's different from you\nKnow no I was talking about oh that's all she said that the that allow you to said they're lucky in that room oh another idea of and yours right oh I didn't say that no that's exactly what you're saying I Want to buy a bucket of Harvey do go ahead way back in a heartbeat ... to your heart's content I Know they say\nIf people fall of the other political idea of and yours there shape\nI did not say that I said that in the in the context of that room where they're laughing at the joke that she made because they're all in their little left us or I might I ask\nWhat you're saying because their their shape because they're listening to the Democrats and yet most people would listen to a Republican Party that would also condemn staff every single day they walk out there they will not walk into the Congress of the year last us\nSenate and or whatever house of representatives they can fix the abortion right now Joe if you know the cost to really watch the United states they can fix abortion right now they can make it happen they get out of the hands of the Supreme Court\nSure right now ... what\nSo again I you're you are not that you're projecting your project economy something that you are reading into a comment that I never made\nThough you said there are and they listen to the cinema they were on this\nWe have control right now of the house that that\nThere's plenty out there and we can't control your emotions\nVery plenty of sheep on the on the on the Republican Party who just they justify and making everything okay that the Republicans say and do so I I but I didn't say that there weren't\nBy by making the comment I had you applied to me that I Am excusing everything that goes on in the Republican Party but I just moved in and they don't want to say not dead on I Know you're not say that I was talking about it right when I was talking about it in the context of that conversation\nIn the context that go there and they were listed Christ the cinema but what we understand right now if you read the constitution as written uh-huh Seventeen eighty five or six or whatever we can as the Republican than Troy how\nWe already know many Republicans actually to find a divorce\nRight now you already know that they're saying you know many Republican than I Am opposed to all of them who will not defund Planned Parenthood for example they won't even that exactly and I have called them out and I'm ...\nSample they won't even notice exactly and I have called them out and I'm opposed anybody who supports such as such leadership as well so you know what makes me a non ... because I think for myself I don't simply just follow along\nBecause it's my party or somebody I so again I applied it in context you can disagree with it all you want you reading to something that I simply did not say Sean I simply did not said\nThey were shape because they were listening to Christian cinema no oh my gosh that's that's what they were and they and they were\nClimber laughing at her comments mocking the people of Arizona yes because they agree with that we're all crazy and why because we're conservative the whole context of what she was saying which were crazy because we're conservative and we have the audacity to pass things they disagree with and they didn't critically process anything he said they just laughed\nAnd clapped along the definition of sheep I'm up against the break Sean when I\nCame on it when I come back when I Will take your call and hopefully you stay with us\n[noise]\nGet out I'm Wendy ... founder surround hospice and palliative ...
