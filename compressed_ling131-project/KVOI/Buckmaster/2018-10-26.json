agree that one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition ...\nSure the the historical American dishes I may disagree with everything you say but I'll do the right to say\nAnd we're losing a left or to although there are some of the right but the left the levers of power like in the jak Phillips case

have their own opinions and say them freely\nAt you know can we do the California case for a moment because all of that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory it seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nIt is easy to say no of course we can't let in every single person wants to come because doing so well transformed this country\nInto one that fewer Americans in any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a I'm blessing for the people who are allowed in\nBecause by encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with no

of reason everyday vocabulary older show we did afternoons five your weight on Jim thirty your wired billboard excuse on the news and intelligent talk\n\nMost of my home at that show we're talking about foreign aid and the a of a suggestion by President Trump that somehow if Honduras doesn't stop the flow of people\nIf Guatemala doesn't stop the flow of people out of their country and to Mexico and then making their way to the United states is the President Trump will remove all foreign aid from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador those three\nCountries there all by the way destitute dysfunctional ah countries I I'm I'm Glad that President Trump does not appear to be repeating this and I hope you stop saying it stops repeating it because it it's wrong\nIt is wrong uh first of all if you want to look at it are foreign aid budget\nTo those countries almost all of it is military or law enforcement aid to helping the war against drugs and to help a battle with gangs like MS Thirteen\nAnd a two to basically aid local law enforcement to try to avoid corruption and to bring order instability in those countries in other words are foreign aid budget which amounts to less than one half of one percent for all three countries of our total foreign\nAid budget in other words you're talking about the zero point five percent of our total foreign aid budget which then comes to point zero zero five of our overall budget it's incidence hasn't really small in comparison to what the government spends\nBut it's spent not for the benefit of people in El Salvador Guatemala or Honduras ... and for the benefit of us\nTo prevent some of these gangs from flourishing and then coming over here to prevent the kind of total societal breakdown that sends desperate people trampling north with no permission and NO PLAN\nAnd a ... frankly cutting all foreign aid to those countries would make it harder to stop the advance of future caravans now are these caravans organized by George Soros know\nAre they organized by leftist politicians in Honduras absolutely and it's reported in the New York times and everywhere else\nAnd the idea that\nThat somehow Democrats wants to use this as a political issue suggesting that we have to show some kind of a welcoming\nTo people who are desperate who were decided to march up to the United states nowhere else they they want to go there probably places where they could establish themselves more successfully and more immediately\nBut the United states backing and we simply cannot cannot uh allow the fact that the people want to come here\nTo allow people want to come here who are willing to force the issue\nLet's go to a concert in Minneapolis Curt you're on the Michael ...\nMichael thank you for taking my call and I felt

I mean you're ...\nWhat can we do our options were mad at you may have just mentioned that there are obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like what what your diplomatic or you know what can we do immediately\nOkay well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nHas a ... agreed to some level of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently have been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have uh gone in another direction or split off from the caravan or\nOr finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this was an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with private charities and they're all kinds of private charities\nThat could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're going to help you get back home and when you get back home are going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that we support\nActually do things like building wells in a village which can make a huge difference I'll tell you what makes a huge difference in a village were in a city in Central America\nIs continuing to help the local law enforcement so that it's not a situation where people are shot in the street all the time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Buckmaster", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "26"}
