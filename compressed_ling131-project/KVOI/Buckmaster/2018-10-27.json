just common sense with Joseph Morgan Phillip I Know that you were there earlier um if you'd like to call in and and get your thoughts and I will take your call I just I had to get through my opening up of remarks on things so anyway back to this this this bomber\nThis man safer but\nOne of the reasons why I literally a and confused by this whole thing and again it it it\nIt deeply troubles me that we cannot trust our law enforcement in this country everybody goes oh my gosh how can you possibly say those kind of I'm going to just explain something to you\nA real fast she did this and this is just a little bit of the ... the the stuff that I've been able to uncover with regards to this story that still stinks to high happens to me I mean it just it stinks to high heaven\nNo and I'm not talking about the hit stickers and everything else although I Do I thought it was a little strange that the the FBI would allow pictures to be taken up a van then cover up ... y cover up the van I mean I I I didn't understand that and then of course I thought that was hilarious as a driving down the highway that the the tarp comes off the ban is just kind of flying so everybody can see the stickers anyways\nUh neighbors all these new jobs but I mean why why covered this ban um if if if this is how he's been driving around\nAnd and that was my that was something that that troubles me as well\nAt this management ... a driving around like this for months and months\nI mean wouldn't have been vandalized or attack I mean we we see we see signs a Trump signs destroyed all sorts of everything's net and here's this man will literally as a shrine to Donald Trump and nobody messed it up in in Florida okay I I guess and and maybe ... I don't know\nBut that really isn't that that big of a deal to me that the the issues that I have is\nIs this OK so first of all because again I'm Talking about the way that the the national media\nAt the national media spins things okay this is what troubles me one of the very first things they said and this was in multiple things and they kinda damp and that down sense that that is that he's white a white Trump's support that was an immediately out they're all over the place well he's not white right in and do what you could you describe him as white I\nDon't even know where he is a Native American Filipino I don't know but I did think it was interesting all the major images that are being put out on on a national media or all of an altered photo look where they've white skin it's an Indian whereas if you're going you actually look at other ... uh\nImages of this man everywhere else in his stripper days and everything else he darker man who I mean it doesn't matter to me my point is is the media is about a narrative that's just what they do they push a narrative\nAnd even when that narrative is not true they don't care because that's their narrative so then there's other things about this and I'll get to it on a second but I see a Philip has called back Philip you're on the air brother go\nWell sorry to hear about your situation but um I think that you're a you're very special you're ready to get up in ... shows\nWell maybe it's still in or something out of the nation and um I I think that you're in a nature I benched arrow you got the same type of style and I think you're a you're a good first this is only about a year that I wouldn't be here\n[laughter] oh I appreciate that Phil ... hey listen I'm not saying it's over but for right now it is it just it wasn't a fit and that's all I can say about it\nBut it takes a lot feel and not thank you for a for Conan thank you for listening I really appreciate it and thank you for those kind words\nSo back to back to why this story still just I mean doesn't pass any kind of melted and again I'm Talking about the way the media present things and the the corruption in our law enforcement at the highest levels FBI and the bird goes how can you possibly say that shouldn't you be patting them on the back no not exactly not if you want to actually\nBe analytical and actually look at the facts\nOn the ground and I'll say facts on the ground things that we know so the case in point\nEverybody early on this with law enforcement this was the national media was calling these fake bombs hoax bombs and everything else and we now know that that's exactly what the the ah the states are has said that's exactly what he has said the alleged bomber has has declared that\nI didn't intend to hurt anybody with these and everything else well you shouldn't have said in many ways and I hope they do throw the book out yet there's no place for that at all but the fact of the matter is\nIf none of these bombs put him detonate it not a single one of them and that's what was early on going on but no we have Christopher Wray of the FBI come along and say that these were not hoax bomb that that his official statement on it\nDon't read the indictment against the man that was brought into to a court of law because I Want you to understand something\nThat if he were functionally explosive bombs and now I'm not making this up if these were functionally explosive bombs they would fall under this category weapons of mass destruction which has its own US Code Eighteen US Code to twenty three thirty to eh okay but that\nThat was no were found in the official indictment nowhere\nDo you know why because they weren't weapons of mass destruction if you go read them a new show of the indictment it says that they had energetic material along with alarm clocks and wiring and you\nGet nation device no nothing\nNothing okay it's\nYou know along with alarm clocks and wiring and you'd be known detonation device no nothing\nNothing\nOkay if this man had a decent lawyer he's probably not going to get the whole book which is why yes what\nWhich is why he was only ... and this is what Jeff Sessions said at that press conference adjust ... Jeff Sessions says fifty eight years he faces up to fifty eight years in prison and then they clarify that know up to forty eight years that's where they clarified later on an incorrect\nFor each and every one of them if they were actually explosive devices he would face a minimum of a lifetime in prison so he'd have fourteen multiple life sentences built on that's what he'd be facing people if he had actually sent this but\nChristopher Wray made it seem like they weren't that by saying these were not hoax bombs\nWell it's serious enough without it my point is is is continuing the narrative that they want to put out there\nIn the days that followed a the the alleged bomber doing what he did he he can't he tweeted out something and I found myself agreeing with Jeff Flake oh gosh you know forgive me but you know and broken clock is as right twice a day you know as I say\nI agreed with Jeff Flake\nDonald Trump should not have pointed out the thing about how this this just look so bad for Republicans in the midterms get out and vote you shouldn't you shouldn't even care about that with regard to this not if you're the president you shouldn't make those kinds of statements at all have some self awareness\nBut he did\nAnd so again you you you take the bad but the good I Love the policies of president Donald Trump absolutely love them I support the man I understand he's up against so much and this is part of what we see\nAnd it it it it truly disturbs me as an American that we we can't I cannot trust or FBI anti OJ right now I mean here we are all ... a year removed from the slaughter in Las Vegas\nLast October remember that\nAnd we still don't have any answers they released their official findings on it earlier this year and they didn't they didn't find anything we still in the world a missing hard drives are we still know anything all these things that should have been to answer they were never answered it's just like man let's just move on let's move on\nAnd it's sad\nThat we find that and yet here we have all these supposedly answers right away in three days with with this guy I it's just okay whatever\nBut the media and and and the FBI and it's all about a narrative and so here just guess I don't know if you missed the story I don't know if you missed it\nThis story just happened right now\nOkay this week but you might have missed it NBC got caught in a major lie because remember what we said about the Kavanaugh hearings all they were doing was pushing a narrative that would hurt Republicans I specifically stop Donald Trump\nThat's all they were doing that was what they want it to do constantly was made sure that that happened and the and the press was all with them\nEvery single person in the mainstream media for the most part was like yeah\nAbsolutely every story was against Donald Trump every story was was promoting what a bad person Kavanaugh was and how we had to look into all these women\nWho remember that third accuser Julie sweating it will we see what happened earlier this this week Senator Grassley from the Judiciary Committee he said the criminal referrals and he said that now there are a criminal a referral against Michael ... you know the porn lawyer\nStormy Daniels' lawyer he sent this criminal referral and suddenly because of this criminal referral that we see breaking force here we didn't see NBC secrecy put out the story\nThat says well we actually had all this exculpatory information from the woman who was supposedly the corroborating witness to Julie ... next a story and if you forgot who ... what what if she was claiming was that\nA Brett Kavanaugh young Brett Kavanaugh hearing a friend my a judge mark judge were spiking the punch bowls of these parties so that they could organize gang rapes that women if you remember that that's what this woman was she was a third accused have come forward\nAnd NBC ran with this woman's story now the timeline shows you what a bunch of wires NBC is on this\nBecause NBC is trying to claim well we didn't actually know until after the Kavanaugh story was done and then we decided it wasn't much of a story to run anymore so no big deal because he was already confront that's a lie\nThey had this conversation with this woman and what she said I never said\nTo ... that I confirmed what ... does she said I never said that he was twisting my words they had this conversation with a four days before the Kavanaugh hearing so they had this exculpatory evidence and and information and guess what they didn't run it\nThey sat on it why because it went against their narrative and the only reason they're producing it now with the spin on it is because I have an Audi has now been referred for criminal charges\nFor lying to Congress because it it's it's a federal crime to lie to the Senate Judiciary committee this man is such a fraud Michael I haven't I I Hope he goes to jail I Hope all these people go to jail but this is what I'm Talking about about NBC because here's a major news outlet\nWho had been exposed I mean completely exposed for running a hit job on Brett Kavanaugh why because it fit what they wanted it fit their narrative\nThey don't care about the truth none of these organizations care about the truth not a single one of them and are you hearing much about this and the other media outlets nope all we're talking about and again I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about the alleged bomber I'm not saying you shouldn't talk about what just happened in Pittsburgh I'm not but this is a massive story and you're not going to hear about it\nYou're not going to hear about it for many of the rest of my other than Fox News and of course you might say well that's because Fox News's contributor but no this is news this is the truth is is the way these people that have\nThey they have they don't have the best interest of the United states it\nAt heart they don't and they cover for one another\nAnd this is an absolutely sickening thing from the national\nMedia and it's all the way down here on local media and I had the audacity to call out and then so and stellar and the rest of their ilk care and they don't like it but I don't care I'm going to continue to call you out you're a bunch of fraud you're not journalists hang it up right opinion pieces go ahead because that's all you while you're not journalists\nAnd people have ... I I have have\nUncovered the truth about you I'm not the only one that can see this and this is why when Donald Trump says from his bully pulpit fake news you know what\nMost of America Says yeah he's right it is fake news and that's a tragedy that's a tragedy because we should have a fourth of state we should have an unbiased or a watcher of both parties but we don't\nWe have we have this uh this this group that has invested\nIn one side of the argument I'm invested in it and this this NBC stories just prevent and I'm going to get to the department of justice next segment the last segment because something just happened to prove all the corruption that is going on then we're surrounded by Russia Trump stuff\nYou can't believe anything and the FBI audio Jay and I'm just here to tell you that is sad but it's true but it I'm gonna go to some callers Paul you're on the air go brother\nIs good program and I'm Still well above have sick over over here leaving stations you have two more like you are on the on local radio instead of losing the only good\nQuality but what I call about was I think these\nThese are these birds from from uh some people go I don't think it's it's his mind as do I think he's being influenced by his wife and his daughter to put up some of these things that you put it\nThat he put on the on the network I don't I don't think the flute playing and you know I think that was of a test to prove you have done the same thing\nI don't I don't know about that part I mean that's that's total speculation may may maybe you're I don't know but I I Know that Donald Trump us links from the hip again I said before and I'll say it again I I I mean some of it I Know is is to to get them off a\nKilter the media to get them you know as a friend put a chasing the or they're like mice and amazed just chasing the cheese\nSo he continues to get his policies through and what not they're not actually paying attention to what matters and I believe some of that is very strategic but then others of it honestly I'll just give you this is my opinion I I again I think like that tweet and the reason why it's so Calif some time to build\nIt because he demanded to brag a do shift human being he really is he's a a total Marshall says he believes about himself\nAnd he and and now in this sense I think it works for America because\nHe's a path himself to the American brand and it it has become if Trump succeeds America succeed and so in that regard I'll take it if that's if that if that's what it tastes fine I'll take that ah so that's where I'm coming from a lot of this when I see some of this behavior from him and I'm ... it's just so childish and ... certainly not prejudiced presidential but again\nI'm I understand some of the others is clearly because I mean he really is being assaulted daily with nothing but lies from the national media I mean it's unbelievable what this man has to endure ... if anything that was going on with our economy and and this nation as a whole was happening under President Obama I mean he is\nAnd and this nation as a whole was happening under President Obama I mean he has his ratings will probably be through the rough because his press would just be constantly how great everything it and they tried to tell us how great everything under Barry Obama even though it was awful\nBut that's because that's their narrative and that's the sad thing Paul we don't have an objective media we just don't it's just a it's the truth\nWell don't you tell us a long term goals of the meeting new people are women covering this takeover\nWell I think the long term goal of of many and the national media is globalism is is a is there is a is a total destruction and at a turning of the United states into a socialist slashed communist uh paradise because that's what they believe all of them are leftist all of them to a person\nA and that's what they believe in and they will not totally get rid of the constitution and have it as a maid in the image that they want it made him\nUm and that's that's a fight rub against an ideological war listen Paul thank you for your thoughts thank you for listening I I really appreciate your support and who knows maybe someday again I'll be on the air I'm Alex I Will get you as soon as we get back from the break after these messages\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nTaller I is there on his ...
