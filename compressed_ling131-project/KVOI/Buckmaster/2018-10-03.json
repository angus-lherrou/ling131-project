some of the more troubling aspects of Americans have it's a dividing line according to race\nBetween black and white or or you could say between black people\nHave had a unique experience in the

intriguing topic it's a rich topic but especially for conservative audience is sometimes a very difficult you know kind of ... issue uh but I think it's so important that ... the opportunity\nOr one of the things that I liked about your book is you give proper credit or to the Republican Party in particular to Senate minority leader at the time Everett Dirksen for the landmark civil rights bill well let's let's start there because one of the things you remind people of is how profoundly\nThat civil rights bill that was passed a with very strong Republican support in Nineteen sixty four changed America and changed life or your family how\nWell first of all the book is structured in terms of the civil rights act or fix before so that you know we go through everything housing education

Williams is with us he is the author of the new book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nAnd um we were speaking a before about basically okay ah\nOne you question polls that show the president's approval\nRating I'm a strengthening and uh I'm In improving particularly among African American people are but\nIf you were to advise the president about how he could bring the country together could improve his standing up and service to the black community will be the first thing you tell him\nWhere I think the number one thing would be economic so you know the president whenever there's a charge a racial insensitivity or just outright racism in terms of his language was tweeting or his policies\nHe says hey what are you talking about historic low black on employment\nBut you know again you doesn't say that in fact most of that took place under President Obama and then he doesn't mention that you have twice the level of unemployment among black if you have a white\nBut what I Would say to him it's let's look at the policies because I as I was saying earlier Michael the number one achievement of the civil rights movement to me is the growth of the black middle class in this country\nAre you one thing that support continuing growth that black middle class you do not want to destroy\nPrograms intended to help black entrepreneur you don't want to destroy community development program\nOr you don't want to go after people who are in middle management terms of limiting their ability get overtime pay you don't want to diminish efforts to try to get people into better schools by saying oh we're opposed to all affirmative action\nEven when we know that gosh there's a tremendous history of people being\nHeld out of those schools you you got you can't do that and then expect people say well yeah we like Mr President because your program is offensively directed at damaging their ability to get a foothold\nOkay just to just hear about let me to finish the players I booked\nEarlier about the growth of the black middle class\nThe tremendous story but they're still with roommates not only twice the unemployment rate or the huge gap in terms of wealth between blacks and whites so even blacks have been moving up there still striving to achieve or to recruit that kind of wealth that exist in black and white America or stocks bonds real estate savings and the rest\nOf your bed at ... you said rightly and and I think we can agree completely on this that there is a great on St whole story of black economic progress\nNot all of that is because of government programs in fact most of that and disarming the Sterns Trump's have documented and I know you're aware of their work because he said it\nIs a that Steven ... have shown that a large part\nOf the black economic progress occurred before the civil rights revolution help to set it up and then it continued in and gathered steam and gathered momentum because of the civil rights bills but you're not you're not trying to say that a black progress\nCan only continue with a government programs are you\nKnow I I don't I I'm certainly not saying that in fact I think\nWhat Abigail and Steven third from his show and it was a different era because then you had the black community you know much stronger in terms of everything from its own baseball leagues through with don't use papers general who were segregated society\nBut in terms of how they could then black business prosper and grow\nA it was limited uh ... and curtailed I mean there was a it's a it was a segregated society and four and a government backing to that segregation and obviously violence in places like how where now where we're used to\nEstimate that black economic growth and black or business but what I Am saying is let's not be indifferent to the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the G. I. bill behind things like\nGiving aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget\nAgain GI Bill job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was often done again August segregated basis so I mean\nGovernment has a role to play but that's not going to be it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment it's just that you don't punish people unfairly\nLooking and I I think I think every every all people have good well should certainly agree on that and speaking of people of goodwill you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas confirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas and and I knew you were a supporter of his confirmation\nI'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the the kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge capital\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling charges against them now I'm In the in the comics case it was ... hill and you know it was very slow to come out but then the\nCommittee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they miss that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then it came out so it's very similar because look at professor Ford\nShe sent a letter to a congressman ash too many makes its way to guy and Feinstein\nAh and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... doesn't think similar to me is a level that hard I don't think that anybody that uh you're Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but it might one there's a difference in ... and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official and he was already a law graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is a matter of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because you know the old presentation of himself as a urging a choir boy he's got a book is the ... and then ... all his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loves\nAnd then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved to party is don't count\nOkay wait if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really\nMonitor for well particularly of Washington DC becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but not even\nA one um would you vote for ... confirmation no on at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off you making offer for gesture gr Clinton conspiracy theory again and Democrat I'm thinking wait a minute\nYou're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lot with a woman\nOr don't you think given given the amount of money that was banned by George Soros and other than it's well known as it's now come out

briefing a Jim Acosta who's a [laughter] a beginning to wear a little bit then\nI I I think that would definitely be the opinion of Sarah Sanders the White House press secretary in any event he was taking on Sarah Sanders about the fact that\nPresident Trump last night a pointed out in a rally\nOr the and pointed out fairly accurately some of the inconsistencies and Christine Blasey Ford's memory the fact that she remembered exactly that she had one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was er which year it was as she couldn't remember how she got home after this alleged incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes and her ... she was the prosecutor who ask the questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders endemic pasta\nOr about that a President Trump's comments\nTo there's something wrong with frozen in the United states mugging somebody ...\nIt seemed to me that he was stating facts that Dr for herself a laid out in her testimony once again uh every\nSchools are laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at ... and picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at ah whether or not the accusations Nader corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nSo you just lose the system\nI think both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh a or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely\nDisgraceful what they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out\nTo make any type of accusation this isn't the process that should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh's and that should be part of this process and the facts have to be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo\nThose are where you see all of those facts laid out and I think she makes a\nVery good job of Islam and many of them had any problems dating sites know John that is their interest and you probably do\nOkay um [laughter] uh\nI actually this this could be the basis I imagine for a sitcom is a a female White House press secretary and they um really really annoying White House reporter who secretly have
