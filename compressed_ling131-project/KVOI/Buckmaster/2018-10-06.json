your life from the perfection auto works studio Mike you're on the air go\nYes um first of all I I Believe that I saw the ad for this proposition it was why they said they wouldn't uh increase your taxes will the people in the county ... text enough as it is we don't need more taxes\nWhile that's that's a a a valid point I mean I'm going to get into some of the nuts and bolts of that 'cause I I there is a there is a way that we need to do to go about trying to fix Irma's when we have a problem in the county in particular but I I'm going to show the dishonesty of a lot of his stuff Mike but yeah I mean I agree with you in general we are\nWe tend to be over tax and different things in that nature but this is just a flat out lie I mean just on anything\nAway but second of all I'm a grant against bones because not not only trying to fix the boats and if the interest alone in those\nOh yeah it's a horrible way to find anything so it's a horrible\nI'm going to be this part of the problem is the county has put money towards the roads and then put it someplace else in the budget how can we trust the county board to do the right thing or are they going to put the money where it's supposed to be\nWell no I I Am going to touch on a lot of that stuff on a little bit later in the ... like a lot of ... stuff to run too but yeah I mean are we there is a great deal of mistrust and it's a valid\nMistrust with regards to our public officials and and when it comes to um what are they going to do with the money once they get it in their hands I mean I agree with that we're going to talk about a lot of stuff to Mike you have any other points to make\nNo I just wanted to let you know what I\nDon't know thanks for calling her brother and thanks for listen I appreciate Jerry you're on the air\nGo there if you go to I think it tastes number six I've got to the four tops about point oh the plant oh six plant oh seven which means that for the civil rights shouldn't take that bond and put them anywhere they want\nOh yeah yeah oh yeah there's there's there's nothing that can that that is going to force them to use them for roads they will have to use it for roads that's actually in the language so there's no but they won't have to use it for what you might think what roads you might think they're not going to take a vote over which roads you shouldn't be used again those are all things I'm going to get into a but\nYeah this is not this is not a good a proposition for a whole host of reasons so much of which I haven't yet touched on but\nWhat's worse than the other ones he tried to push so far that we put it against\nI Know but at this time around I don't I don't know once you get so bad\nPeople are just like they throw up their hands and like well okay maybe this time we'll get and and because you got to remember we're the Republicans are first of all very much in the minority in in the county and then secondly and there's a lot of people they just don't they don't vote and we have got to get out and vote\nBecause if Republicans would just go to the polls and vote we could stop a lot of this stuff we really good even though we are in a minority just by showing up in force we could keep a lot of this nonsense from happening but there are there are some things because we do talk about solutions that how can we get out of the whole and I do want to get to that uh by the end of the show too so sometimes you need\nTo pass a bill is saying that his son can going on this very passionate and nothing to help that\nWell I'm a I'm going to discuss her a little bit later I Will I Will discuss that as Well Jerry\nI Love your show thank you so much\nYou ma'am I appreciate it thank you for listening to the show and thank you for calling in thank you for scratching your thoughts OK so for anybody out there who may not understand what what's going on here they are going to take municipal bonds and those are\nOkay a debt securities issued by by the county in this case but it can be any governmental organization now to bondholders okay and then uh the the face that they're that they're the date that the debt is supposed to be paid back and that's called a maturity date\nAnd then they take this that the failure par value the bond is the amount of the bottom line is issue and then they entice these investors to buy a bond and doesn't lend money to these institutions and the issue or pay interest on that a bond okay and then a ...\nAnd ... extra benefit of this interest for a lot of these people that he's using exempt from federal income taxes and this is why so many people jump into this kind of stuff but you know if you're an investor you're looking at this ... hey I can avoid income taxes because I'm gonna make some money and I don't have to pay the federal income taxes and then sometimes you can also be exempt from local and state taxes as well\nAnd and if this interesting that that is usually paid every six months and until the Daytona ... maturity and that's what we we've been paying on these you know the her bond Pakistan we did almost Twenty years ago we've been paying all that kind of stuff because that was another huge bomb thing\nAnd so now those things are starting to come to a to um maturity and they're they're being paid off right and\nAnd that would lower your my taxes are at a well anybody in here whose property owner I'm I'm no longer a property owner I was for a few years\nBut it lower ... ward lower your property taxes but now they're just going to stay flat with if this bill if this prop path is okay so you\nWe've already seen the dishonest language from the county but now I'm going to talk about some of the dishonest language from again an article that appeared in the Arizona Daily Star that was promoting this\nAnd and you know the way they they talk about this stuff it makes the issue that much harder to actually understand what's going on because they themselves the writers of these pieces\nThey either are willfully lying or if they're not fully in ah up to date up to speed on on what they're talking about and that's a problem right if you have people who are talking about something\nIn a supposedly the intelligent manner and they don't know what you're talking about that's problematic I mean how is anybody listening supposed to understand what's really going on and so I'm just going to pull some examples from that as we go through as I explained some things but for example from that store article\nAnd this is the court said if the proposed four hundred and thirty million county wide road bond passes in November it will represent the single largest investment major street repairs and the history of Pima County alright\nThat's simply not true\nIt's simply not true because the money will not go towards ... or the county roads OK okay it's being split equally between the municipalities and it's almost like there's a bait and switch and I'm gonna showing it further as we read this article throughout where they can fight the county with Tucson in ... in particular but the conflate the county in particular what\nThe county with Tucson and in particular but to conflate the county in particular with all the municipalities but a\nA a Tucson specifically because two comes the largest municipality in Pima County so when they say that this is the largest bond package for the county that is just not true a specific to roads because it's not all going to Pima County only around a hundred\nAnd sixty seven million or in an estimates and that that can vary it kind of these are asked him as nobody really knows uh I can be a hundred and sixty two million a hundred and sixty seven I've heard different numbers on that\nBut it's it's it's a fraction of this if not the full or a county that's getting all this frozen so that you know it's got to create your your problems because when you're talking about\nHelping Tucson now with its roads with this tax then you need to stop and think the city of Tucson already has a very high taxes sales tax it have it has\n\nNow they want is obviously because it gives them more money and you know according to Robin rain there interim director of the city's Transportation Department and this was a quote from that article that I'm referring to\n[noise] they estimate that there need your eight hundred and fifty million dollars All right in St repair now that's in the city of Tucson some ... keep that number in mind [noise] about two hundred million are major streets according to her\nAnd so the two hundred million that's projected to be their portion of this is he's got to make a big impact for them\nAnd then you then you go ahead and you look at the county and they have they have similar numbers to okay the similar or the or the county estimates that they have eight hundred and sixty million road projects throughout Pima County now that's again unincorporated Pima County when they say that you see how they don't nobody distinguishes when they when they use those kinds of things\nAnd get it at ... and and understand that point because the star article bingo says it conservative estimate suggest it would take more than one point eight billion to bring every road street is driving up to excellent standards\nIn the entire county so that includes ran a or a valley Tucson any other municipalities have a portion of itself in Pima County and unincorporated but unincorporated just eight point six and two sons is eight hundred and fifty okay well for folks like\nMe who don't know ...\nIncorporated unincorporated how does one affect the other as far as hobbies monies or\n... or ...\nWell they they have a they have a if a by state constitution they have a percentage basis for for how it's a sold out and those numbers are according to the estimate is you know are two hundred point seven million for Tucson for being a county a hundred and sixty seven million give or take you know\nMiranda twenty six point one million oral valley twenty three point one salary to twelve point to\nA yadda yadda yadda so which which areas are incorporated and which aren't all those places like I mentioned are incorporated I mean in the elements palate yeah they're all in corporate little towns yes its hair corporate out in the rural area yeah so the ... the the unincorporated Pima County\nSo like I said that the structure road for example or on muggy ... between Shannon in that area you would think that that's\nA a part of oral valor Tucson but it's not as part of unincorporated Pima County which is why the streets are messed up if you try if you're traveling up Shannon ... their screw screw ball because it's unincorporated Pima County and then suddenly if you get fired up north\nWhere you finally get back into oral valley or even into to Miranda till they smooth sailing you could you could just see it it's the roads not that I don't know where all the the boundaries are but they're they're marked it says welcome to Moran on those areas\nAre going to be part county in part state them\nDon't yeah I mean but this is not the money this is just county money what I'm saying is if by when they when they when they they don't distinguish about what they're talking about because they they they mentioned one point eight billion in total and that's all a Pima County meeting all the municipalities contained within the county as well\nBut then they don't mention the fact that eight hundred and sixty or a million of that estimate is Pima County unincorporated\nAnd an eight hundred million of it is Tucson so the vast majority of the one point eight of ah that I've been telling you about the one on ... billion\nIs those two entities not the smaller these who take care of the roads why did they have sales taxes than it sounds to me like some of the folks are being short changed a lot of these people are gonna be shortchanged us this is my point ... sales tax makes a lot more sense for a lot of reasons where the guy specially when it comes to something like road because\nYou're using them more than anybody 'cause you live there and so it's affecting you the most plus anybody who's driving through your area will help pay because they're they're they're they're\nThis is a horrible idea because this is just giving up the entire ... no matter where they live across the county giving it up according to what percentage and shipping it around to all these different areas\nAnd and so you are subsidizing the waste like I said a Tucson in particular and I'll get to Pima County but it is different the Pima County waste issue is a different issue than the Tucson issue because they don't have a sales tax and that is a huge issue that's a huge issue right but\nFor the ... I'm not arguing for four sixty three I mean I I think I've made it pretty clear where I stand on four sixty three this is just it's just a horrible policy what I'm Talking about is the way people talk about these entities they do not ah they do not delineate\nAll right and you have to do that if you're going to fully understand it but the second ... another issue here another issue another point of consideration\nIs that that's a that's a drop in the bucket I Want you to understand that number two hundred million of this ... this is by their own number is eight hundred million in Tucson I'm it's gonna be a hundred and sixty something million for Pima County and they have a eight hundred and sixty million shortfall that they need money for\nNow they're talking about dragging this out over ten years ten Fifteen Twenty years as they get they add on this bond debt what's gonna happen to the rest of the roads overtime they're going to continue to crumble are going to continue to get worse you're you're putting a massive band aid on this is not going to do any good I mean this is a bit of soil role that you could ever ask for\nThis is the way it's going to cost you more money at the end of the day why because of the interest payments on the fence I mean that's good for the people who are giving you the money that we're going to make the money tax free why there enough in for it but you and I the taxpayer who is who is bearing the burden is not good for us at all\nThat's a horrible trade especially when you consider another point this is for capitalize assets not capitalized so and things like basic road repair that's not included because that's a non capitalized asset whereas new roads and\nMilling and all that other stuff which is including the language of this that's\nPart of that so if you don't have a major road issue but you had the same recurring pot holes in your area or for for decades guess what you are probably not going to see this money on fat guy will raise my hand right now and tell you I promise you you won't see it but you're going to be paying it\nWith the promise that they're fixing it we've got to do something\nAnd has not been a fundamental flaw with the way they've been doing this all these years they provide the money to build something but then you don't have the money to maintain it overtime\nExactly and and this this is and this is where again [laughter] when you have Steve ... you know the water run away Republican on the other the the Tucson the gal so our long lost a GOP guy ah he's a Democrat of course today\nBut he found his his brain uh recently you know when he came out and he said this just doesn't make any sense and this is what he said it wasn't a well crafted option it's shortsighted it does not do long term preservation mind Steve where you were you in a coma for years\nI mean it's like suddenly this guy has found himself\nYes he's absolutely correct this is the worst possible solution you could give and all it's going to do is no big deal raise your taxes oh but wait if you read their thing it won't do that\nThis is ... it's it's\nAbsolutely fraudulent thing that's taking place here okay\nAnd I\nI Know that there are solutions that I'm gonna try to get into that in the final segment of the show\nBecause there are people who are opposed to this\nWho are not helping the argument and this is why I promised ah Jerry when she called and I am going to discuss now the her fish you an Pima County and the waste issue in the county\nI Am not saying Pima County there's not waste money they do waste money I agree with all my concern a brother who say we should not be spending all this money on these ridiculous golf courses that soccer stays I totally and one hundred percent concurrent with you OK however\nWhen it comes to our road issue\n\nThat is not an issue that you should be bringing up you know why because as with this proposed a proposition ...\nIts profit sharing you have to share when you are dealing with property taxes and the general fund\nOf the Pima County board is finance through property taxes and because of profit sharing laws they are responsible for unincorporated Pima County therefore the her money's they get\nWell for unincorporated Pima County therefore the her money they get are responsible for unincorporated Pima County road nothing else so they cannot take money from the general fund and just take it and start using it for unincorporated Pima County roads they cannot do that\nSo when I say they're wasting a one point five million over here are five million over here from the general fund\nThe point I always tried to get my conservative brother makes your correct you're wasting it next better things but they can't use it on the roads\nBecause they are responsible for unincorporated so if they if they let's say took a chunk of ten million said we're gonna take ten million dollars you can get the surplus and we're going to use it for people to kind of rough guess what they'd have to do\nYou have a portion of Tucson give a portion to go to Miranda give a portion of ... that's what they would have to do so they want to end up with ten million to using and Pima County unincorporated road so it worthless argument to say\nBut stop wasting on this and this and this and this and use it for our roads you can't do that because they do not have a sales tax if they had a sales tax they would have a lot more ability flexibility to move funds around in the general fund they could then\nHave money over here and use it for roads over there 'cause they need to make up the shortfall 'cause we're in a shortfall and I'm not talking about that when I get back from the break we are but that's why they cannot just do it from the general fund so please stop saying please my conservative Rodman because it's worthless argument to make with regards to the county it's not work", "show_name": "Buckmaster", "year": "2018", "city":
