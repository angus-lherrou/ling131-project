three three eight that's eight six six nine five four three three\nEight eight um we are talking about basically\nOverstating the case again and again and again on on the left or do we really need to have special monitoring the white males as Don Lemon sense or isn't that racist hate speech\nIt is I'm not saying is evil [laughter] I'm saying it's racist age speech and uh it is it appropriate for the president the United states evil\nOr is it appropriate to suggest that the only thing the U.S army is for is killing people now the I'm Adam Serwer road apiece with a terrible headline and the headline tries to relate Pittsburgh to the caravan\nAnd it says Trump's caravan hysteria led to this meaning that the shooting\nAt Pittsburgh and a Adam Serwer was\nOn a a TV and uh basically suggesting well suggesting basically that ah we may be looking at a potential mass water\nReally here's what he had to say\nHe said he said in the army to kill the enemy that's where the army does the army kill enemy so when you say eight thousand troops to the border to stop thousands of people who actually won't even be there for weeks when you're saying is these people are the enemy and he may need to kill them\nOkay there's nothing that President Trump said that approximate so that I think the whole\nPurpose of sending military resources Army National guard is this show of force and determination\nAnd one of the things that the administration very quietly has been talking about I think is actually positive on this\nWhich is suggesting that okay if people come to the border and they present themselves for asylum and present applications even if they're coming in a big caravan those applications will be considered\nWhat will not be considered is people sneaking across the border and then presenting themselves for asylum that not that's inappropriate and\nThat would involve a change in U.S policy or let's go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six is a this Dan in Akron, Ohio\nI might go are you doing today doing well well\nYou know I'm an old man and I remember when President Reagan called the union and evil empire and the left one nuts now the Soviet Union was the real evil empire they killed hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of lives\nAnd how President Trump evil is ridiculous these people are childish they don't know what history\nWell your ear entirely correct and people do need to know history I mean and and the point is that uh I I think we can establish\nThat murderous regimes genocidal regimes are evil\nAnd ... by that context of course the old evil empire the Soviet Union deserved that title but to try to suggest that the Trump Administration is somehow equivalent\n... is just so first of all it's poisonous to our politics because it does encourage violence but this is coming from the left so it isn't as frequently called out let's go to Frank in Newark\nNew Jersey Frank you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYeah Hi my I was saying that um oh over the decades I was a Democrat a liberal and now I'm like I was a Republican now I'm an independent but I've been involved in a\nLot of political thing you know feminism or things like that and and ... you know the the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call that a lot of stress\nIn the nineties we add diversity visas and we saw corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion\nYou know the American with the minority arrive at times ... American lost their job and they ship and somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry\nPeople have to understand that there's two angry groups here it's not just the minorities and the blacks I mean and and the women if their regular average person white and what have you know and it's been going on for far too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers said beware of the factions here very smart either the constitution and he found that should not be practicing identity\nPolitics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't get them positive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nWell the the point is you don't give people ... you get people's rights based upon\nTheir status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity\nOr certain heritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas which by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations and I am glad that's going on\nDrop is this notion of reparations and I'm Glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's\nGo to a\nJoe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael ...\nHey Michael how are you I'm well oh go go ahead and\nUh I got I got really quick statement it just seems kind of a struggle between good and evil and let me give you three quick examples you have a a left in this country that systematically not only trying to wipe out the existence of God\nBut they're trying to wipe out our Judeo Christian

they wanted to know know national health care that that that's\nOkay you know the President Theodore Roosevelt wanted to do that a long time ago I think it's wrong I think it's profoundly wrong but it was also supported by President Truman was supported by President Theodore Roosevelt president sang from Roosevelt having said that I think it's a bad idea\nBut to say that it's on American it it
