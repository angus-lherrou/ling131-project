be under attack under attack increasingly in our society and the ATF the alliance defending freedom is standing up for your ability to find your own path and to live your own conscience\nYou can call the ATF right now you have a tax deductible contribution whatever it is it whether it's a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars if you can give a thousand dollars then that means that there is a nother thousand dollars on top of that that will come in and you will in effect be giving two thousand dollars when you get one thousand\nAnd you get the tax deduction at alliance defending freedom or

eight um let's just go back for\nA moment to this deep question about the out of wedlock birth and why it is a problem for any\nChild ... and I'm not now suggesting that people will be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is preferable that a baby\nWho was conceived out of wedlock be aborted or dispensed with what I Am suggesting is that we get back\nTo the idea that in this society there are norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be\nThat it is worthwhile for people to come together to form a durable relationship and to raise a child in that context it\nThe truth of the matter is an you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating\nIt is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a total distortion that most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby no no it's true not all marriages last\nBut the majority do and particularly for four people today today people are getting married at\nMuch older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty two and Nineteen Seventy and one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the ... the idea that\nYou're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nThat's that doesn't mean that it's not valuable for your future children to be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing nations\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married\nAnd there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the cash that society we should uh\nTo these new trends and um find new ways of helping these kids succeed and I just want to say this you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know the modality rates were so high\nThat often a parent would die in the child would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded and adapt to these transfers\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI wouldn't say that we need government programs horse\nThat would that would a\nSpecifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think the ... would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nIf you let me just mention something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate this but uh I I I'm going to say this rich cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raise taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this shelter you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and it's been shown by a wealth of books and information a\nOkay I look I I think I think that's true\nAnd the idea that Farrakhan now that he's elderly and I believe he's in his eighties I'm sure he's in his eighties and ah he does not seem to have lost an ounce of his\nPassion but it's not a passion for anything constructive and if you are going to say and I would\nThat it's unacceptable to say that one ethnic group or one religious group is responsible for all of America's problems\nAnd they are enemies by definition\nEvent doesn't classify it was an anti Semite what would it take\nA we'll get back to that a quick word from relief factor this came in from somebody that I'm most you know that's pat in Los Angeles that would be ...\nBy assure you I

that show\nBy Michael thanks for taking my call again you better go\nUm so I just want to say uh there there's a difference of the impact of statements when they're coming from different group better disparaging other groups and what I mean as it has a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time\nAnd so ... in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white versus views you\nHave your money you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries and centuries in generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on issues or on white people or something like that so there's different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously\nMuch more serious if somebody in public office say\nIs that same something that his negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan is saying is however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he had received from David do\nBecause even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at Farrakhan history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd I do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates\nBut at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people on as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\nI understand that Michael connected one more point go okay\nSo my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of their have all of a wide where it's coming from ... is a kind of a revolution are fighting back about what happened\nTo them at the people over time whereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it wouldn't have packing people not because they did anything to them they made off\nAnd spirit area than made up that these people were doing stuff again that ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenian\nOne of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also make knowledge or directly so the Armenian people work rules the Turks and they were undermining as it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith and there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you ought to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people",
