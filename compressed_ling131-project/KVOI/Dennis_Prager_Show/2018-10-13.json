[noise] about uh thirty four weeks as the pregnancy I started having contractions that went into labor\nAnd so we went to the hospital to deliver David now this whole this whole time\nYou know I at that point it has been a couple of months that we knew that David without live I also learned about an organization called now it laid me down to sleep\nIn that organization provides remembrance portraits two parents suffering the death of a baby when a friend first told me about it I was a little hesitant I thought\nIs that appropriate music and pictures of a baby in the situation but I went to the website and I saw how beautiful the photographs were and I realized that we would never have this opportunity again\nTo be able to photograph our son and so I decided you have the photographs of our son\nSibling we went in to deliver the bad hits heartless still feeding and when it was time for me to to push me pull the heart monitor awesome man because they knew that you could possibly die during the delivery process so they took the heart monitor off\nAnd the thing I was hoping for the most was that he will be born alive and so when he was\nBorn that they he did not have a heart heartbeat he was not breathing\nAnd they handed him see me and I was I was so crush that our son was important alive but then at the same time I remember looking at him and thinking\nWow this baby was in me his beautiful and just like any first time mom would feel about a baby there their first baby just how beautiful and I cannot believe that I was carrying the baby but the reality struck again that he was not alive [noise]\nWe we set the time with him and then our photographer came in and she photographed\nDavid and just you know documenting or time with him we gave him a bath we helped him she weighed him a we have pictures of him on the scale of each of us holding them of us as a family of him alone and ah we\nYou know we just cherish those moments that we had with him\nAbout six hours after she was born we just we knew it was time that we need to let him go and it was one of the hardest thing I ever did [noise] too I give him over to a nurse and know that I Would never hold them again\nSo at that at that point yeah I\nYou know I was being discharged from the hospital and we now needed to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time we were able to think some of those things through there's\nMany many other families who who's a baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare but we knew were we were we were very um and\nSo I remember going home that night and\nTrying to go to bed but then I realized where where is David as you get the hospitals funeral home pick them up and I called the nurse at the hospital\nShe was backing of her shift again and she assured me that he was still there and I was just wanting to know where my baby was so we went up so a few days later we had a memorial service and we buried us\nDays later we had a memorial service and we buried our Sunday then\nYou were told that we could go on and\nHave other children that this was a fluke occurrence and I have seen online other stories with babies who had what it's called hotter syndrome or where the parents go on and have healthy children and his chromosome should turn up okay and all the other tests were fine so we were\nClear to have another baby and we got pregnant a couple of months later\nWe we're cautiously optimistic and um we went in for a number of ultrasounds diet is still considered an Irish ... the because of our situation\nBut we still would need to wait until the sixteen way culture town to see if our baby had kidneys\n[noise] so the sixteen like ultrasound we went in and the doctor within their with the ultrasound technician and I'm laying there and he just ... they said wait a minute let me step in and so\nHe stepped in for the ultrasound technician and he was looking and I kept asking what what's wrong what's going on and he wanted to tell us they just kept looking and I said does he have kidneys and he said he does\nAnd I said okay then what's what's going on because we knew something had to have been wrong\nHe had a guy that go into another room and my husband and I just we waited for it seemed like forever and then the doctor and he came in and he said\nHow your baby has his around the neck and severe fluid buildup in what we later learned was that it's just a hiker him as a hydra high drops the fluid and following around all of his Oregon [noise]\nAnd at that point they were unsure of the gender of our baby because of all the spelling and then on the doctor said that his heart could stop beating at any time\nAnd so ah he said you can't move and I didn't feel and move it all that I Need to come in every week to see it as hard as is still beating every week we went in and I started getting more help because I thought maybe this\nIs our miracle maybe this is what we have to go through to have\nTo have our miracle and and nothing has ever been too easy for me throughout my life so I thought maybe this is a miracle every week we went in and then by twenty four weeks since the pregnancy and [noise]\nWe learned that our baby's heart stopped and so the doctor said you can you know you can still carrying the baby for a while and you'll probably go to natural labor or if you don't buy a certain period of time I can't remember how long that was\nThat we would have to enthused or you can go ahead and do and I looked at him I said what am I supposed to do if I'm Still carrying em and knowing that you died so my husband and I went to the hospital that night and they in the labor and we had a little boy that we named Ethan\nAnd that I had a camera in my bag [noise] and I remember thinking you know let's get some pictures because when his when he was born his condition was extremely severe\nA lot of teachers were not identifiable\nHe gets his hands and feet [noise] spell it was so he was pretty severe\nAnd I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring now let me down to about two and I remember thinking about the camera in my bag that maybe with him covered in a blanket\nAnd my husband and I holding him we can have a picture of him but I just didn't have the courage to do it and I didn't have anyone encouraging me to say you know go ahead and take some pictures and um so he never photograph the den and that's one of the biggest regrets in my life\nAnd what a story\nAnd more of it after these messages here on our American story\nWhy campfires I Want

that's her story and it's it's not over [noise]\nPeople ask\nMe questions and I don't know exactly how it out but this is some should not everything better because now we have our Jay and yes I I think\nPartly it's better because when my husband and I we're grieving the loss of our babies before we had RJ we're also grieving the fact that we may never raise children of our own and at least that part has been answered for us and we've chosen not to have any more children we just\nDon't know how we would handle it if something happened and it's just not worth the risk were one for five at this point and so that's why we're sticking with ... now but I think sometimes people build once you have another child\nAnd things are are better for you and um there's healing that's come over it'll be ten years this month since we last David\nBy there there's a lot of healing that come with that but we still miss our boys we still love them and and I often say when I was speaking to people is

come our way but we do have a choice on how we're going to respond are we going to be bitter\nAre we going to be better and even though there's part of me that goes into the bitterness and I feel sorry for myself and bad about what happened I always try to focus on\nThe better part and what can I Do to give David in eastern life purpose and meaning and I found it how I can do that and a number of ways and I I couldn't do it without my faith either that's been as significant part of his healing journey for me\nSo I Would have people asked me if you have children and this was before I had an art shave\nIt depending on the situation would would depend on how I answered it but when I Would tell them yes I have two boys and haven't I typically was met with oh I'm so sorry I didn't mean to

Education Association [noise]\nWelcome back to inside track normally\nHosted by Bruce fast today hosted by David at the hammer a welcome back again we have a caller on the line three her name is Joanne and we'll take this call first and see what joy and has to say\nJoanna Joanna how are you right now\nI'm doing great and we got a couple of movies here and hopefully we're doing OK\nOkay great go ahead or you've got some white\nEye as someone else on the line\nI'm Sorry we can't hear you just go had joined\n\nOkay um yeah I said there was someone else on the line there I'm yeah I'm calling in because when I hear in regards to volunteer I really want to just clarify it and say that overall it's nonsense rhetoric we in the county have plenty of money\nTo take care of our ... our main issue is that we just have not prioritize what we need to do when we say that you know higher taxes is good for economic development is clearly false\nAnd anyone who believes in India that is truly not looking at things as they they are in the current state of affairs\nYou know one of the things that\nActually got really take a look at the priorities remember we're using athlete over forty million dollars above her all the money to fund the Transportation Department and we qualify by saying that it's transportation expense now that money needs to go that route\nAnd when we turn around and say that you know these bonds are going to they're not going to increase our taxes that's false it will increase our taxes and it should be noted as such because what happens is is the issue that saying that your tax rate we're going to be able to pay down debt\nWas going to keep the rate if they're still\nSo as a result of that we're going to have more money in there but your tax rate isn't going to go down that's not true\nOur tax rate would be going down but for the fact that these new bonds being issued their weight will say up there and it will continue to stay up there the rate does not need to stay up there and we do have the money you could get the relative done and you know I went to I also want to dress one thing a lot of people originally\nWhen the bond the entire implementation plan was being developed it was said that it was going to be done over a ten year period and you call in or check the county seat when you wrote would be done\nAs people started to call in they discovered that there wouldn't be fixed until twenty twenty three twenty twenty five and you can imagine what taxpayers are doing when they find out wait a minute you're asking my money now that you're not going to fix by rote until seven eight ten years out\nSo all of a sudden the narrative changed and now what we're going to do is take a look\nBut you're not going to fix my road until seven eight ten years out so all of a sudden the narrative changed and now what we're going to do is take a look at an early but the people who are deciding what happens to people who decided the roads right now\nThey're drawing I think I Need to ask Ted the to weigh in and answer some of your objections hotel yeah you're on\nWell go ahead first off I read this is going to be paid back by a secondary tax oh so you're correct there it's not a free money\nThe foreign and thirty million dollars will not be all issued in bonds initially a front so there is going to be issued over that period of time as well what is true is the county's committed to stay keeping the tax secondary property tax rate at sixty nine cents\nPer hundred a dollars of assessed value so there will not be a tax\nIncrease but they're also won't be attacks decrease which could occur if we paid off these sorry\nBut that's the fallacy that is the fallacy\nThey do and this is Chris I just want to let you know ah I have a tendency of agree with you because and here's why because the board of supervisors can\nChange that tax rate and changed the bonding ... drew a Fifteen day notice right out of their own right out of there are rules and regulations so I I Do agree with you on that\nI mean I I I get gentlemen or it until all three of you and I'm\nVery sad to hear that the a GOP is taking a neutral position on this overall um but I I Do find it um\nIt's the thing that we really need to look at is not this issue of the bunch really if we don't need to find we have\nEnough money to get our roads that we just have to make priorities I mean you're going to see for example we've got something coming up on the agenda on Tuesday joined I\nJoined and we've got other callers on in in the queue here so I appreciate your calling in I'm going to have to ask the jury to come on the line now thank you Joanne\nJerry are you on ... you've got a John on actually oh John and John a jury must have hung up\nSo it on your on that and go back I'm really concerned about this is the lack of trust I have been the supervisors do what they're saying they're going to be plan to do and\nWhat's written in on this I guess is that I'm now every year they're going to go back and re evaluate the roads to see which ones to get the money as I understand this\n[noise] adults that\nAre really worries me on that 'cause you asking people to commit the money that oh okay this year we're going to do you know just thrown in jail since that was mentioned earlier and then next year will it done yet but we're gonna do a lawful could he wrote again\nAnd the year after that they're going to do that while we're good money to do the court ordered down around the south and to the airport the sort of thing where there's nothing to find\nEven on an annual basis that you know to commit to doing this road at this time a real worry for me\nSo what you're saying I think I hear you saying John is that uh there's going to be totally under the border supervisors to decide what gives fixed in when it gets ... and there's no commitment being made to the voters ahead of time so they all know what's going to be fixed and when\nExactly they want to fund the pot of money and then they'll just dip into it as they see fit and that could be treating year to year depending on so maybe it was in favor\nOf you know who won the the twenty twenty election they're going to make choices based on that\n[noise] Okay John thank you for weighing in ah that's our friend John Holdren thank you John or recognize your voice there are a lot of jobs but there's only one John Holdren thanks for calling in a supervisor Miller I think you're on the phone Europe\nI yes I Am I I just like to make a couple of comments and then I'd like to ask a question I'm\nOne of the comments about you know your property tax rate is going to be held well that is as long as the board of supervisors\nVotes to hold it at that sixty nine cents each year and then twenty twenty all five of us are up for election so you could have a whole new board there is no guarantee a it we vote on that by statute every year so I Want to make that clear the second thing is the other factor that plays into your property taxes\nIs your property evaluation and just to give you an example my home since two thousand three has increased Seventy seven percent my valuation on my home\nSo each year people's valuations are most likely going to be increasing and even holding that rate constant you know that your property taxes will increase as your evaluation increases so those are two things that the question I have is for Mr Maxwell\nOn you know you're talking about this is going to drive the economy um and I get that we always think in the short term but the the the real question is\nWhen you start increasing our property taxes again\nWe're already the highest property tax county and the state our rate is three times that of Maricopa County how what is your proposal for bringing new business here on and getting new business to come here if we continue down this path of increasing taxes\nAll supervised Miller thank you for calling in always appreciate your thoughts are on these issues obviously\nThere's no guarantees on a lot of that stuff as you mentioned the supervisors do give are up for reelection and twenty twenty and and things can change\n'em and so there was a little bit of trust and so I understand that there are folks out there that just flat out won't trust the government they're going to have a hard time saying let's have some bonds as far as the economic growth\nUh you're correct right now we are the highest\nProperty tax and being a county in in the state uh overall when you have property tax sales taxes as well special district impacts you know we've been dropped down to ... to ... than the\nAs you know fifth and the the ... of the Fifteen\nUm counties in the region so there there's a lot of different things that do play into that but what is truly a fact is that when companies come here to consider moving to Arizona they are troubled by the state of our infrastructure are both from a curb appeal side which are you'll hear people talk about but also for just the conditions that those roads aren't so\nYes there is a two parts to the piece of trust there is a little bit you got to trust you got to be be sure that these roads get then the second part is than demanding that the officials live for what they're going to say\nAnd what we've set ourselves see coming out on this one has been very ... we're going to make sure this money goes to the roads and gets her parents now you brought up that so far a lot of the conversations been about the lack of uh input into those unincorporated roads inside of Pima County I I Would I'd like to just remind everybody that\nYou're I think you said thirty eight percent I think that that is correct I mean I think I was that we both agreed on that that means a sixty two percent of the road repair money goes to the municipalities to other rose I can\nTell you there are plenty of roads in all those ... municipalities that fit the requirements for either reparation for preservation or repair\nAnd and that's significant as well because where do all these companies that want to come into the county and live or do they live they live in our communities they live in a large portion of the Pima County has urbanized and the municipalities obviously are still making those changes is still significant for track ... of businesses\nI had I I ... heartedly agree with you that we do have to do this however by the county passing these bonds they're taking away the municipalities ability to do it themselves and if all the ... vote or don't vote for these bonds\nThe city of Tucson pretty much has\nEnough voters to pass them anyway so they're basically losing their representation to you know in the event that they don't want this I wouldn't say that they're they're losing their representation ion fully understand your position on that and the city has done has gone for a hundred million dollars of bonds and then they went for a a sales tax to all put into the roads and they've been having to do that\nThere are still plenty of neighborhood roads in in Tucson that does do need the ... the repair my point in my concern is if we don't start repairing these roads now and and I don't want anybody to take this this is the only alternative is doom and gloom what we're losing\nIs not the fact that the roads will get worse is that opportunity for businesses and growth in the region as well there's there's money there's jobs there's sales there's so many other things that go into that that we can then use
