A. won't be um up for or are up for cuts uh every every time the budget is is reconsidered and I'm One of the things that uh\nThe red for the best in that proposal did was try to do just that for future salaries creative protected funding stream so that we can get our teacher salaries\nAre to where they need to be to keep teachers to attract teachers to Arizona and retain teachers in Arizona\nAnd that didn't make the ballots so now well actually bill it made the ballot but then how are you in court removed that's true it technically it made the ballot but then there was an issue with the language I Believe\nI think the Supreme Court's concern was that the language I think the wording that I read was could be confusing the language that was on to petition that people were signing a there is some disagreements about that I'm a you know the terminology that was used the Supreme Court felt wasn't precise enough unfortunately\nFor our listeners who do not know who ran a doctor Randy freeze is that you are a veteran a doctor you're the assistant minority leader a little bit about your background briefly please\nOh certainly bill I moved here in two thousand eight with my wife\nFrom Texas I moved here for a job at the University of Arizona I became the associates a trauma medical director um had no real indication that I Would have a political aspirations are office holding aspirations\nAnd then the shooting happened in January two thousand eleven I took care of those victims including Congresswoman Giffords and that sort of I'm open to I'm a window cracked a door if you will in my mind about\nYou know I've always felt being a trauma surgeon was public service about expanding my public service or to the community by serving in public office so about three years later then I decided to run for public office now have served since\nYou were working very hard on that opioid crisis legislation or how did that all work out\nYou know that I hold up as a shining example of how I uh we should be doing how we should be governing in Arizona that happened at the beginning of last session the governor came to both caucuses and said this is my proposal for addressing the opioid crisis in Arizona crisis of courses Nash is nationwide\nAnd um he asked for input from both the caucuses and we gave the governor and his staff some input on what we would like to see as Democrats or his staff actually listened a they put into that proposal the two things that were important to us what many things were put us but the two made on what we would like to see as Democrats or his staff actually listened\nA they put into the proposal the two things that were important to us many things were put us but the two major things are important us where a I'm a good some merit in sort of clause that allow someone to call for help\nOr when someone is having a overdose problem and not\nHave and have some mitigating factors and have it not be so strongly held against them if they have paraphernalia or drugs president while they're calling for help lost someone else's overdosing or maybe themselves or order saying\nThat ended up in there it has it has some limitations on it uh but that we needed to compromise and for the negotiation so there it does sunset in five years but we're hopeful that\nThat that provision will save lives and save money and we'll be able to renew it and the second thing that our caucus asked for was we noticed that there wasn't a lot of financial support in his package and we said or we're concerned or ... the package he presented us addressed a lot a naive people\nGetting exposed to opioids and then becoming addicted well we wanted some help for those people that are presently addicted\nAnd have um a no insurance or are under insured so the governor of created a pot of funds available to help those that are under under and shorter or didn't have insurance to access medical assistance treatment for their addiction are and that was ten million dollars for the state and we were very pleased with those negotiations in my entire caucus than\nA a joined in with the governor said yes we support this\nKind of nice to have something bipartisan up in Phoenix\nIt was really a shining example of what we should be doing what we could be doing if I'm the executive is willing to uh except a budget that has that requires Democrat votes to pass and that is something that has not happened in quite some time\nLet's see if we can get a quick call in here Jeff would like to speak with Dr Randy freeze go ahead Jeff\nYes Hello Dr resigned a general question is why they would like to create a\nSource or however that may be reviewed it washed applies to the rancher which seems like forever ... into the uh the only source of funds for the school system and Arizona\nAnd was always a without referred to state land stress and look for ... so I don't know how big that is what that's a lot with my question is what happened to it is it not why not ... or at all\nIs it open and I would just like a sort of you know what ... what makes sense yeah well I was ... I took a\nGood question thank you Jeff\nAll right Jeff yes great question is the state land trust was created when Arizona\nBecame a state I Nineteen twelve and it still exists and it is growing and and as a principle must be protected\nOr so the interest is used or every year and dispersed to not only our public schools that are public universities and a couple of other things to school for the deaf and blind and actually some some of the state hospital and I know other things but when the ... every year and dispersed to not only our public schools that are public universities and a couple of other things at school for the deaf and blind and actually some\nSome of the state hospital and I know other things but the majority of the lion share of the money goes for a public schools but its dispersed every year at a rate of I Believe because of proposition one two three is set rate of six point nine percent\nAnd um you know I think we need to be more creative I'm ... and that happens for the next ten years and I think after that it goes back to a variable rate um but I think we need to be more creative um with our state my interest in what I meant by that is\nCruz no doubt and there is a cruise for everyone and that is one of the things that we love about the river cruise experience you don't have the sea sickness issues you will always see land and a joke or in the industry is is when you go through the mustard drill on some of these river cruise lines the safety precaution is\nGet out and walk to show that I was kind of levels or that yeah it's up to your ankles so there's all these as I say the nuances\nOf this a sit down if you're a couple if you're a single person if you're a millennial go and talk to a travel advisory bond very odd because chances are they know or if they don't know specifically a particular crews there someone in the office that dot\nThat's exactly right in some of those nuances don't be thinking of the midnight buffet and the mega ship oh that's what I see on TV we can put you on a thirty two passenger yacht in the Caribbean and talk about the different ports that you're going to enter into in the on board experience of that\nVessel much different than the mega shifts\nAnd of course there's the crews where you can really go back in time and it's kind of like of course there's the crews where you can really go back in time and it's kind of like a step back in time it's the wind jam or cruise ... that is that a session at your annual travel show which will be coming up\nIn February it's one of your most popular people there's a segment of the market loves that when Jim\nAnd they do because it really is sailing you know you are not just on the waters powered by the jets underneath\nYou really experience what are what the sailors experience back in the sixteen Seventeen century of crossing the Atlantic and it can be a little rough so you have to understand what you're getting into so if that is a concern for you we would not recommend it but there are a lot of people that love\nThe quote unquote rock and roll of that when jam or\nHow about those worried about the whole thing about how do you get to the\nCruise the air transportation well there are close to home ports that are that we would definitely recommend there are Pacific coastal cruises you could drive to San Diego or Los Angeles if that had a concern of yours you can also say could drive to San Diego where Los Angeles if that's the concern\nOf yours you can also sale the Mississippi River if you say well I can take a couple of our flight but\nI don't want to go overseas to do that and you can't go wrong with an Alaskan cruise\nYou can view the Columbia River gorge was right in the Alaska or the Mississippi then of course you mentioned Alaska and uh I was up there are at the end of August first well actually the second time I've been up there but I didn't realize how much I had missed it had been a few years it's a great destination say repeat destination\nA lot of people that might be a bucket list no time or no not at all I can only ... yeah you can see it in so many ways uh speaking of airlines the bag\nFor things obviously you need to know your airline know what you get so obviously southwest hey no worries ...\nI'll be careful when you are traveling international this would be something to think about if you're traveling international and you think oh I've got this first bag free when you start traveling in the regional airlines you may have different weight limitations in size limitations and be stuck at\nThat airport flying from Barcelona to Madrid not realizing there's going to be a baggage because well I didn't pay one flying to Barcelona\nFrom Tucson while you might have one they're so no before you go what's ahead of you some of the the the little tip some tricks\nClearly carry on could be one way to carry on to gate check so if you don't want to have to be messing around with your bag if you have a couple of connection right planned the gate check and and the airlines love you for that in fact\nSome things they're doing now is forcing gate checks for some of the boarding people I pack smart role\nCoordinate your clothing the two of my favorite ones are try to join a loyalty program flying airline more often so that you can move up and your status and one of the benefits and perks of becoming let's say a gold member with United would be a complementary bag\nAnd look into credit cards with the airlines if you don't have a preference or with a credit card company and you want to look at consolidating your flights on American you can get a card that is supported by American Airlines and you can get free bags from a check in standpoint\nBecause you're using a credit card any ways and you get the points that turn into miles and potential\nFree flight southern tip make sure if you can to plan ahead and go ahead and get their clearance through the ah with the the card that let you go the avoid the long lines\nYou bet global enjoyable as bad as it is about life as a little tip that ... that we learn when we were up in Vancouver in August uh we did not bring with us the\nLittle card that we have we are in the system but bring the little card with you because the Canadian system is different right they'll honor of the American system but you have to have a little card debit card so we had to stand in line and weighed about an hour and that but look a little tip\nTherefore and make sure at one last thing when you are carrying on yeah make sure to plan with TSA in mind as you do have some issues and regulations there you don't want to get caught or trying to figure out should I throw this away mail it back give it to the TSA agent because they're they are strict as they should be for\nOur say All right Ryan Hanson a bone dry ... travel make that first stop at B.
