the president now understand\nHe's not he's not their enemy the left is how is that fair\nFair and I think it has done as remind a lot of conservative a lot of Republican\nWhy they voted in twenty sixteen I'm you know the Trump got about sixty three million votes they weren't all the lunatic fringe data and as we know many of those people voted for Trump\nMany of those people voted for Trump for a couple of reasons that actually went about Donald Trump himself many people go to because they understood\nThe future of the Supreme Court with that issue a Trump followed through on that promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch and now a Brett Kavanaugh the other reason many many people voted on the twenty sixth in a lecture and wants to vote against Hillary Clinton\nBecause of the implications of Clinton presidency falling on Obama's two terms and they did not want a Democrat in that office and I think these hearings resurrected both of those issues down at the\nData for the Supreme Court indeed the law in the United states and the behavior of the judiciary Democrats and the party itself have reminded a lot of people\nOf what the fate of that party looks like right now
