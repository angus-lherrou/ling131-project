but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five were young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no

all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up why why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like oh I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you

welcome\nThanks and good to see good to have you we had this incredibly wet Sunday out in a ... to a surprise uh got a hailstorm and then another hail storm and then it just kept raining and raining and raining so\nThat all afternoon covering that it was not exactly a relaxing weekend but it was certainly I'm welcome wet because we certainly need that\nMy clients are the happiest said [laughter]\nI'm I'm happy ... as as a as a gardener I'm happy as a a real estate investor and property we hate brain but if it's been it's been nice to have a little bit of diversity of breaking up the hot weather\nIt was it was good uh we lived in uh we live in a neighborhood that slope to and so the water was rushing by and it was brown and I told my wife there there goes everybody's front yards\nA right down to to the wash and the wash behind our house running very very heavy it was a quite something and uh here we have now a print media we have kind of leveled the playing field with the TV people because we can go live on Facebook or YouTube and\nPut it out there as it's happening to people and so I was out a all afternoon doing some of that you can find that a necessity to sun Facebook\nPage and you know that's a cool thing it is I'll bet you as as things go a long that's going to be a significantly greater importance to to what you guys do particularly in small community kind of publications such as the one you have\n... and they are awesome it's very easy to do you know what you go out with your phone and you can instantly do whatever you want and actually we really use this\nEr during the a teacher walkout or because there are lots of protests and uh you know you get someone who can string a couple of sentences together put him on live that's the scary part because it's all live if you drop your camera or you you know or don't have the right way or something like I say something yeah and [laughter]\nAnd I've done all of the above but it's more it's\nMore than that which is exciting as someone who also loves print media or you've got face it puts you off with Twitter you've got other ways to immediately connect\nA ... keeps that great you still have I Believe in most print media objective reporting which is becoming unfortunately more of a rarity but it's terrific However I'm I'm thinking when I read all this stuff for you guys now having to work twenty four seven\nWell you know we like to think that we always were doing that but before when the press would roll you just kind of take a breather because you know you can't do anything again until the next time the press roles but now\nIt is it is constant and ah so this uh this this is a good thing particularly for a small community like ours in which you said something very interesting because lots of people have those cameras and they're putting video out there but they're also putting out\nInformation that hasn't been verified guy because you know you can be at one house and it's like everything's fallen down in the ... coming through the roof and\nUh you know the world's about to end in in the next house over it's a Snuggie warm and no problems but if you present that picture\nA then people start panicking so we actually even when we're doing the lives stuff we're calling people were verifying information and and getting it out so so I think in that way the news media are still relied upon to actually be the ones who have access to those who know the answers\nThis is bill Buckmaster green things has been the place for all things green for the Buckmaster

... gallery dot com and of course you can find them on Facebook and venture editor of the green valley news and so the sun sitting in for Bill and they've caught us in the middle of the uh Monday political face off with Dr Don Jorgensen and Bruce and\nBruce someone to go back and revisit a comment you made just before the break you were talking about candidates and energy and just in a I'm more of a thirty thousand view a of that topic what what do you mean by energy and do we have it in the sea due to race with Ann Kirkpatrick and illegal markets Peterson\nOne will think I don't think either of the candidates are what I recall outstanding personalities\nUm and and they're just they're there's been a certain critique we've spent so much time maybe this is where I was coming out of from the beginning to\nThere's been so much talk about US Senate and governor I think that there's kind of voter fatigue or an donor fatigue a you know all you know all through Republican ranks anyway Don might be able to speak or specifically on the Democratic side\nUh but um they just didn't seem to be a whole lot of intensity about this and you know the feeling was that Martha was a very difficult person to replace for for a Republican standpoint\n[noise] well I think from the Republican standpoint that's true and looking at energy a ... and ... and her Patrick ... we have to think about that how do we see that energy\nAh in our first that goes to TV ad so those are ads so it's about how the candidate comes across when they come across and they're not attack at some of the other side whichever side\nThe other than is what you're seeing in the community and the energy that has been demonstrated on the Democratic side really comes out of the volunteers and the waves that every day let alone weekends are knocking on doors and making calls\nThen you also see the candidate in public at many events are pretty much ... anywhere and everywhere and again there's evidence of that as we were talking earlier about the social media there's evidence of bad everywhere and I think that is where you see a difference even though\nA Bruce doesn't believe and Kirkpatrick is the most exciting person and that's fine or she is one of the most energetic in terms of being everywhere being out in the community getting to know people talking about the issues publicly uh malaria is going to have a number of volunteers or ... yes but as we are talking at the record campaign is right\nOf volunteers or ... yes but as we're talking at the record campaign is very different and that's where I think Anne's experience and in an enthusiasm shows through and for a novice like Marquez Peterson is she really has been captured that it\nWill end unfortunately layer hasn't she hasn't been able to communicate that she would be a very effective congresswoman I don't think there's anybody that questions that she would serve the community well she's kind of you know right in the middle of things she's not too far the righteous not too far in the lab\nShe has tied herself to Trump on many many issues so I don't think you can say that\nOh well you you can say that I'm I'm telling you from from the standpoint of of you know following her for Republican standpoint she really has tied herself that closely to the president\nDone you talked earlier about individual donations and ah that they are up as far as the Democrats goes that accurate\nVery much okay and can is there any way to determine whether a lot of those are first time donors to two elections are we are we dragging in or drawing in people who are kinda new to this whole game or because it's a mid term a President Trump frankly um has definitely raised interest\nOr are we seeing new blood involved in politics\nI I think it's fair to assume that just because of the numbers when you look at the campaigns and in previous years to today just the volume of donations at the lower levels twenty five dollar donation fifty dollar donations\nThere are many more of those in aggregate looking at the campaigns like a Christian sentiments campaigning Kirkpatrick says we're talking about\nAh you see those numbers from individual donations which are higher than previously or the money coming from outside is a little bit higher on the Democratic side than in previous\nElections but not significantly so so I think you can assume realistically that there is an increase in that's a the reaction to Trump or because this is in part a referendum on on the president as all midterms are\nAnd it is again the additional avenue other than casting one vote for displaying support for candidate and the policies on the left\nSo Bruce it means something when people attach money to their support are we seeing an uptick in a GOP donors or\nDo you must you must not be reading the newspaper orange the collective twenty six point two million dollars last month and gifts almost all of a small a small donor gifts or the president um excuse me and the arts here in this cycle is now over two hundred million dollars that's almost double\nThe highest amount of the ... had ever raised in a in a similar\nPresidential or a a mid term\nAnd further during all the same period of time or the president has raised over a hundred and five million dollars a tortillas twenty twenty reelection a friend of mine who says well I don't know if it comes to run for reelection trust oh he's running for reelection he'll activity he loves every second of what he's doing and and they're going to have a ton of money going into that to be\nDragged out of office kicking and screaming no matter which way it goes but uh in in partial agreement with Bruce who's point a yes the Republican numbers are up the Democrat numbers are even higher but overall this year's election has broken records for\nA fund raising in donations and and the amount spent on national elections I Believe it's the first time it's gone over one billion dollars\nSo I guess I was one thing that everybody can credit President Trump for and that is there's a heightened interest in a poll intensity absolutely sure absolutely we are going to go to the book master show live lion and we have Greg on the line from Tucson Greg you there\nAnd then I'm Glad you brought that up because it's exciting for the for the thought that was especially those of us who are fond of Donald Trump because I think it does spark interest in folks are thinking of getting into government I remember living in Minnesota at the time that ... tour around and successful in order for governor\nBecause he stood out from the the other two are sort of like lifetime\nA candidate for office and it was Jesse ... willing to do things for the people but I have a question about this current campaign\nWhere I see what I what I Would call slime are being thrown at ... or ... cinema and of course the announcement at the end of the spot is that it's not coming from Shelly but if she felt\nLike they were too many inaccuracies into which filth could she stopped those ads from running in terms of what they're alleging about cinema\nBruce let's go ahead and have you answer that and technically uh no she's not allowed to collaborate with these ah packs correct\nYeah but the simple answer is is that any reply from the candidate and this is certainly come up with plenty of times for Greg any effort to to halt those ads this is considered coordination technically a violation of if you see a regulation\nHowever to his point if she were to make it clear Don that she or mark mix Sally someone did not want this stuff to happen it would and wouldn't it absolutely all she'd have to do is come\nOut not even with a press conference so that would be great you should come out on Twitter she could make a statement from the campaign denouncing that adds she hasn't done that in fact in many cases she has participated in the smear campaigns against well neither of them has\nTo be fair here I mean there's an awful lot of mud being thrown out there and I don't see anybody coming out and saying gosh let's stop it no\nBut again you have a case here where mix valley actually accused ... of treason well Schatz outrage well she ... she actually said those things gone that's no she didn't say the things that was the ... border talking to her saying it and she said whatever and\nYou know what she had an opportunity to back office ... uh inter Arizona Republic interview and she refused to do is send in moments you can change what to say he's focusing\nOn the issues that the different ... and I want to I Want to be clear here because she actually did not accused Christmas in ... of treason she accused her of are saying that it would be okay if somebody went and I'm\nA foster that the Taliban so she's saying you know other people doing it so Murtha wasn't saying you are guilty of it but rather guilty of saying that it would be okay if someone went and did that and the ... and the key differences that one is accusing someone of committing a crime and mark MacPhail as you did not do that but it starts\nAre not to bring in my opponent but you know she has said that show kind of pick and choose which laws depending on which one she thinks are good or bad show of force I've always said\nPolicymakers make the law or people make the law via the initiative process ... offices enforces the law and so one of the problems we had with some of these voter enacted a amendments are statutes is\nIs that it creates some and ambiguity and uncertainty and so originally our officers were task we we're required to\nDo these criminal appeals ... um there was an appeal on an issue of a criminal conviction related to that to the oils and so what did when voters approved a medical marijuana law while you know what was ... when it came to you know the products and you know determining weight and potency all that kind of stuff\nThere was some there was some Vegas so we\nActually um [noise] uh the other side appealed that and we're originally filed a pleading saying that uh the case should be dismissed on procedural grounds um\nBut I actually think that's the wrong thing to do so we're actually going to withdraw that pleading and we're actually getting urge to court to hear the case because I Want the state Supreme Court to provide some clarity to us\nBecause I Do believe 'em and enforcing the law as it is so in Arizona voters passed the voter initiative\nThat um you know a wanting or allowing for medical marijuana I think they want to make sure that there are products out there that people that are sick they get their hands on and so we want the court I Want to court to ultimately hear this case and to provide some clarity to all of us\nBecause I think in law enforcement or just in general what the law requires is consistency certainty people want to know what the rules are and they want to be able to follow them and so I think that this opinion actually created some uncertainty and until the Supreme Court\nHere's the case and um you know may ultimately determinations as to how the language should be read um you know we think that no one should be prosecuted for that and we further more I think the Supreme Court needs to hear that case\nOkay so you're going to be withdrawing that request then you say to dismiss the appeal correct correct because we\nBecause we actually I Want I Want\nThe Supreme Court to provide us some more guidance because I Do think it's unfair to everyone whether you believe in\nA medical marijuana or whether you don't like medical marijuana I think the uncertainty is bad for everyone it's bad for prosecutors it's bad for the people that um you know are selling medical marijuana and so um it's important I think for the court to speak on this and so um we're going to urge the court actually to cure the case and here on the merits\nOkay you've come under a little bit of scrutiny regarding proposition one twenty seven and that would require a big increase in the use of renewable energy in Arizona in fact it would require fifty percent renewable by\nYou in Arizona in fact it would require fifty percent renewable by twenty thirty you amended the ballot description of crop one twenty seven to include\nA that this must be met quote irrespective of cost to consumers some people felt like you stepped over the line and maybe we're introducing something into that prop language that really wasn't in the prop\nAt all I'm ...\nYeah they're they're asserting thank you Dan down because I I'm ... I'm sure many of the list are now that I'm a out of state\nCalifornia billionaire Tom Steyer is literally spending millions of dollars more money than any individuals ever spent on an attorney general Sharon race trying to sell and damaged my reputation and you know if you look at what we've done\nOur officers diner mother was suing companies like ... whether it was filing a lawsuit against Purdue pharmaceutical down there in Tucson going after you know car dealers for a false are misleading advertising getting the largest judgment ever again in state court against ... and we have taken on\nUm ... you know big interests big corporations there is no sacred cows um and one of the jobs and duties of the attorney general and this is Tom sorry not telling you is that we are required by law to review\nEvery single ballot proposition approve them and the language and it's on the ballot the description is you know we we review that approve it and we provide information\nThat's accurate and fair and so I Am always going to err on the side and making sure that ballot language is something that consumers can understand and it's something that's accurate and so no one's saying that it's inaccurate and no one's saying that it doesn't help consumers because it does um and the reality is\nIs for if you look at the ballot propositions or on the ballot right now six of those seven ballot propositions um we worked with the proponents of without initiatives um or you know we work with the folks and\nUm changed some of the language and so when we did these changes we actually\nContacted you know Tom ... folks to prop one twenty seven folks and said\nWe think this is important for consumers to know here's what we think and we sent it to them\nThey could have asked you know they could have proposed proposed different language they could have sued us to stop it you know we we know this time there's been some lawsuits sometimes to stop on the ship\nBut they did nothing instead they're what they wanted to do is score cheap political points because for whatever reason\nI have I'm Tom Steyer doesn't like me\nHe's attacked me personally he's making slanderous and and the family story statements about me that are inaccurate and true and it's not fair and I ... as an Arizona and some of that grew up here that what we're seeing now with what's tires try to do with me as a tax on me is the same crap that's going on in Washington D. C.\nOr a lot of these other races our all you do is you throw a bunch of mud gimmicks unfounded accusations and then you hope everyone hates that person\nBut even if it even back in Arizona elections director Eric Spencer was surprised by your additions to the description of the ballot initiative did that did that surprise you\nWell once again we didn't have to what we turned over every single document related to this ballot proposition and once again what what what Tom Cyrus not telling you\nIs the secretary of state's office actually sent over language before that wanting to show that that was going to increase like something like three hundred and Ninety percent or start talking about actual increases and our lawyers the people that actually worked on this or working with a party said\nNow that's two specific we don't know how much it's going to\nIncrease that may or may not or may not increase that much\nAnd that's why that language irrespective as to cost\nIs accurate because we don't know costs may go up and they make it out but the whole point is is that the corporation commission will now be charged with energy mandates that are no longer tethered in parts of article Fifteen of the constitution but instead I Will be entered into these new provisions which means that there'll be mandated irrespective of cost\nAnd I guess the only thing I Would add about the secretary of state's office says that that that email was sent over the day after the shell Reagan lost an election and I think that most people here at Arizona I Know that she lost a primary election because\nUm they were not ever they were not I'm a bastion of competence there was a lot of problems and so I I guess I Would just be very suspect of anything coming out of the secretary of state's office and the fact that\nThey were all over the board on this um I think was just um you know the secretary of state's way of um you know basically giving giving the finger\nGiving the figure to me um and thinking it was funny on their way out the door\nOkay attorney general mark ... we really appreciate your time today All right thanks a lot you\nKnow a our thanks to him and our thanks to Mona Danish bakery which uh the\nUh home of the Danish gringo bonuses um northeastern corner of swan and sunrise and a big supporter of bills show and that segment when we return we're going to be joined by Tony ... she is the color of superior court in Pima County we'll be right back\nAnd\nThe regional transportation authority funds projects that help make our transportation system safe reliable and efficient improve\nRegional mobility is important for economic vitality for businesses and families\nThe R T H continues to finance construction work for six new roadway project scheduled in twenty Eighteen for more information on Archie a projects visited Archie a mobility dot com V.
