I got my degree in counseling psychology\nAnd started to work here I'm\nA Arizona or Tucson had a more kids in the system proportionally than any place else in the state and there there's a lot of theories about why that was there is but uh the bulk of the kids probably come you know we are from the ... we call the ... as the O. five ZIP Code that which is the north west side of the city and the south east side of the city\nOr but it you know that the needs are scattered throughout a and the services that are delivered are provided throughout the entire community or some I felt I was fortunate to both work and live work in a work for the kids that I work for in the same district\nBut when you're you're part of the southern Arizona delegation that is primarily of the Democratic party ... how difficult is it ah to get your voice hurt in in Phoenix for southern Arizona\nI'm you know over the years it's been ... ... it's been different when I first got there we we both Republicans and Democrats we met almost on a monthly basis everybody from Tucson we you know regardless of party\nAh that's kind of stopped about ten years or so ago ... years ago so we haven't done that as frequently as we wish could or should or ... you know working in the minority as we were talking about earlier it you know when you first get to the legislature has kind of a shock to figure out when you learn how these things really work\nBeen nuts hasn't it I'm I'm loving the rain but I guess we got some hail down here on this outside this morning um we have Mr Shelley Fishman a on line Shelly is a financial advisor and we've got some things to talk about good afternoon showing\nHey good afternoon and thanks for filling in real bad to get back from vacation and sick and I really felt that one but you are doing a great job I listen to the first segment and and uh again thanks for doing that\nEnded up Robert Shelly thank you for the for the compliment Shelly I I've been watching the financial news uh yesterday and today we have what is defined as a volatile market is that correct\nYeah the return of volatility is what smart the last couple of weeks or for a while we had a steady a kind of\nSlow but steady increase in in a investment performance\nBut the past couple of weeks we've seen a more and more ups and downs and because we're dealing with vigor numbers just in general or even if you only have one or two percent\nChange in the markets or maybe maybe a even a little bit less than that the numbers are still you know in the two and three hundred points on the dial and most of us who grew up\nUh watch the markets a three hundred points swinging the doubt\nYou know is alarming or even if that's less than one percent as it and you know as it turns out but today we had some very negative numbers overnight or mostly based on some oh lukewarm results from a large manufacturers\nAnd then and then the Chinese market took a tumble yesterday they mostly around\nThe the policy direction given by the ... the Chinese a central banks\nThat would have made free money harder and harder to to uh to come on in China and he and that had a negative effect Chinese markets just as in increasing interest rates here in the United states have had a somewhat a negative effect on\nOn us markets where what all night ahead\nI'm Sorry what role has um has the European Union's a a rejection of their budget a bit because Italy is thinking that they're not getting as as much with their effort structures they're show is is that having an effect on this world\nAnd it does and keep in mind that if the markets\nAre are very very into related show not only are the economy's interrelated but the markets are related and the reason they're related\nIs because for instance if you take a look at the U.S in the five hundred fifty percent of the business of nearly fifty percent of the business of the ... five hundred is done originated or sourced overseas\nSo when what a country like Italy creates on certain dates and the markets or as a few years ago I mean Greece was everything we talked about that is going to create disruptions in both the supply chain and in them and the the end market or a chain\nOr a and and so a uncertainty is not the friend of investors so you begin to see greater rid of all the ... the the other thing that shaking up the European markets of course this is\nNot knowing where that is going right or if it's going to happen at all\nNot knowing where ... is going right or if it's going to happen at all\nI see that that oil is dropped to about sixty five dollars a barrel just today might have come back up to sixty six or sixty seven last week it was trading is Seventy seven\nSo has that affected anything and will that affect future earnings are for other companies that that they use oil alive whether it'd be a transportation or airlines or whatever\nYes all of the above [laughter] Iowa [laughter] or any any company\nThat reliance on on oil\nA to either do the business they do work to ship products they ship in four\nOr raw source material or out of or distribution in sales\nA higher costs of petroleum and and and they find petroleum products is going to be a problem and we normally when you get volatility in one area of the economy you can count on there being some higher volatility and others but the the thing that's really\nProduce volatility in the petroleum markets right now is uncertain\nAbout what's going to happen with a supply of petroleum Iran and and now from Saudi Arabia so any time in the middle east uh is is a shake it up a little bit sorry I've got to check going overhead up into the next time\nBut but in any time of those markets are on certain\nUh than than um that that changes the price of oil a we've we've seen will go from a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel down to twenty five to thirty dollars a barrel like no backup and the area between sixty and Seventy dollars a barrel\nAh and and it's very difficult if you're a manager with the company plan your ah your ... in a strategic a cost over whatever you're planning horizon as it was great for water is if you don't know what a major cost item\nIn in in that are planning cycle is going to be and that's the problem with living right now\nOkay now what's happening with the trade war tariffs how's how's the market responding to those\nWell at first the market responding negatively when the tariffs were announced and then everybody kind of took a deep breath and said well wait a second it's really a small percentage of what we do when we're going to carve outs and maybe I'm more of this is more bluster than reality\nWhat we're beginning to see however is that\nThe um uh the effective of these tariffs\nOr has been factored into the price so right now I don't think it's having a great deal of fact uh two months ago he did right now it doesn't been the number we had a GDP numbers\nThe second water that were really very good because it was a great extent what where companies were doing in anticipation of those terrorists were stocking up on supply\n[laughter] so they were buying stuff ah and and so that that created a spike over four percent and and the GDP Growth for the second quarter we're gonna see third quarter numbers I think come out this week and we'll we'll see whether those numbers fall back down to about three or maybe a little bit under three percent\nWere split stay up there in the height free they stay out there that's very very good indicator for the economy if they begin to fall down a little bit\nThen then what will see is a more normalization but but right now I think the effect of east Arabs and the uh subject when terrible wars are factored into the price\nThe tax cuts that the president uh initiated have in this year has had the companies just ordered the cash did they buy back their stock\nOr are they really reinvest in in in people and raising wages what's what's the market say is really happening with those tax\nSo the only thing they're not doing his raising wages uh what we're seeing is that the cost of labor you are except for the very low end where there have been so minimum wage adjustments that are causing other companies have to pay more uh the cost of labor is staying centrally flat\nAnd and that's been identified the certainly by me as as one of the long term\nUh\nThings in the economy that is a fundamental change and it's got to be fixed however what we're what we're seeing right now is is that\nThe the cost of labor I as as a function of the economy is is just not a factor because it's not changing very large\nDidn't with what happens to companies when let's say they forget to raise the wages of their employees when the new minimum wage is ... come in Des Moines got hurt because what happens when with things like that happen\nWell um I I think it's on a case by case basis somebody's got to file a complaint and that's a complaint has to be adjudicated\nUm the the thing that we're seeing is that as the labor market heightens companies are are have a higher propensity to raise the minimum wage because they can't hire a hold on to employees\nOn the other thing and you mentioned it a little bit earlier there's the amount of money that is being\nLet's say where did the by companies that don't know what to do with that money would be for the tax cuts we had about a trillion dollars in cash cash equivalence in the American in American businesses that had not been invested with the tax cuts\nAnd we saw a a whole bunch of of uh buybacks in in stock so yes to to that question you ask 'em we're still seeing close to two million dollars on his vested capital\nI'm we see some increases and this is a good sign some increases in an investment in in the plant and capital equipment\nBut not what we were led to expect a would be there and and so it was a very great extent that element of the tax changes that were passed last year by Congress um have been a disappointment\nLet me ask you a question um our renewables like solar and wind can they maintain grid integrity power grid and degree for for the whole state ... alone\nYou know that's a great question you know renewables play an important part in our energy portfolio and it's a growing a portion of that portfolio of the challenge with renewables as you alluded to is that they are intermittent you know the sun isn't always shining it shines a light here in Arizona which is great and that's why\nArizona elites the country we are actually the third the highest state\nIn the country with a solar energy generation that's because the sun is shining a lot of the time in Arizona and while the sun is shining solar energy is actually the lowest cost method of generating electricity but the challenges that the sun's not shining and the sun fades past the horizon folks get home from work they expect to be able to\nTurn the lights on to have the power that they need to prepare dinner and wash the laundry and and that power needs to be mad and it can't be met with\nSolar energy and when the sun is shining\nAs the cost of storage falls\nThen that creates more opportunities to benefit to a larger extent from solar energy but right now the technology is not there it would be cost prohibitive\nTo to transfer a significant portion of that solar energy this generated while the sun shining to the time and one that energy is actually needed and consumed so what we see is in the states where they've tried to\nTo drive the the solar energy production beyond those natural limits is they actually have a a a surplus of solar energy California actually\nPays Arizona to take its surplus solar energy off of the grid during the times when the sun is shining\nFor many months of the year because\nIt will overload the grid so we here in Arizona we actually shut off our solar panels we get paid to take their sold their surplus solar energy off of their hands and utility rate payers in Arizona benefit from those failed policies\nAnd California and we should up near those failed policies here in Arizona\nWhat uh what's been your biggest challenge and are you in your race so far\nYou know that's a that's a great question you know I think the biggest challenge that uh that the commission has faced\nAnd well there there are significant and and they were challenges when when I arrived at the commission you know when I first was approached by the governor's office to take this appointment or there was an ... an ongoing investigation into a former commissioner or for allegedly having accepted a bribe\nAnd that was a a pending investigation at the time I had some\nSome concern some hesitation about stepping in to the\nTo the commission where you know the public confidence had been significantly harmed but you know I was really struck by what the governor said to me at the time he said Justin\nIn these circumstances the number one priority that I haven't feeling this vacancy is to ensure that I feel this vacancy with someone I'm confident we'll served with the highest standards of ethics and integrity\nThey can see with someone I'm confident we'll serve with the highest standards of ethics and integrity\nI was very humbled and I'm very honored that in those circumstances the governor turned to me to feel this vacancy\nSo I recognize that you know if I can play some small role in rebuilding that public confidence in the commission that's worth doing so I accepted that appointment and went to work and I've been working to accomplish that to rebuild that public confidence\nNow since that time that the investigation was completed and went to trial and it ended in a hung jury there was no conviction but the challenges that that the public damage to the confidence in the commission has already been done so that's what I've been working to overcome those challenges existed when I came to the commission but I've been part of the solution\nI've been serving with the highest standards of ethics and integrity but more importantly I been advocating policies to increase accountability and transparency I offered an amendment to our commissioners code of ethics to prohibit\nCommissioners and candidates for the commission from accepting campaign contributions from the entities that we regulate and I think that that's step number one I got to ensure to the to the public that the commission is not unduly influenced by the commission by the utilities that we regulate the most important and leading the effort to reduce our utility rates\nRates are actually lower today than they were the day that I took office and that's an accomplishment that I'm I'm very proud of love to tell your listeners out more details if if if you're interested but uh but an accomplishment that I'm I'm proud to share with voters and that's what I look forward to continuing to do at the commission if I'm successful in winning an election to another term\nJustice Mr Olson thank you so very very much for your time today I think you had a ... you put a lot of information out I think it
