stick about something that just isn't a pill by scientists so what's the biggest weakness\nThe biggest weakness I think has to do with the problem of the origin of form new innovation of a new fundamentally new forms of life but that requires a prior innovation and that is innovation of information the creation of information since Watson and Crick in Nineteen fifty three\nWe have understood that information in digital form inscribed along the spine of the DNA molecule is essentially running the show at the cellular level and biology if you want to if you want to build a new form of animal life\nYou've got to have new tissues and cell types but new cell types require new dedicated proteins to service them and proteins are constructed on the basis of the information for character code that is stored in the DNA molecule so new form requires new information\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information it really isn't it's alphabetical type of graphic or digital in character\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to say our own experience with computer code\nThe idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arrangements of characters that are designed to construct one thing\nAnd turn them into another message that will construct another completely different things and plausible if you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones you're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random a mutation will change and yet the neo Darwinian invoke random

you are right why does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological naturalism and it says that if you're going to be a true scientist\nYou have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich

F. G. and full disclosure makes my boss Hi Shelley [noise] um what we're going to do today\nIs we're going to get down and kill the onion back a little bit on on what is a credit union what is a financial advisor what is your broker dealer what what are all these terms that we use every Tuesday and any time you kind of a\nYou know take a look at CNBC or whatever financial station you might look at\nOne of these terms mean what is it what does it take to get some of these titles one of the things you always see when you look at business cards and financial people there's all these letters after their names and some of them you recognize like NBA or a CPA or something like that but some of them you don't and and you know why why are they important\nAnd so uh I also invite this is after all talk radio so I invite listeners to give us a call the buck master hotlines five to zero seven nine zero twenty forty do you have a question or comment about anything that we say on the show today please feel free to join the discussion\nSo first of all what I'd like to do is start with Mike Prior um because he was my boss and if I don't have that Mike what's her broker dealer why do we need I'm\nSure a broker dealers or a stylish to help a a investors or get information buy stocks in companies and uh so broken dealers basically support a financial advisors who have uh the securities licenses needed to buy stocks buy bonds and get access to investors to those investments\nShow you you can't do that directly with the companies you want to invest in you need this middle man\nYou know back in the day when broker deliver set up you did a now today there are certain companies to let you buy their stock direct you know they had their ex purchased programs and things like that or do they do it the stockbrokers are kind of\nA not as necessary I guess is it used to be that from a broker standpoint now they're more at this third from an advice standpoint and so you see brokers shifting to be more advisors and helping and helping clients\nOr with their investments more so than just you know finding out information about a particular publicly traded company does that information is available now today on the Internet more than it was in the past so it's not so much a broker environment anymore is it as an advisor environment\nIs sometimes I hear the word wire house ... what's the why our house and how is that a special kind of broker dealer or is it different from others\nWarehouses and you think about uh some names out there a look at it shares a name sure from our house is out there but do you think about uh things like UPS or Merrill Lynch Morgan Stanley those were all set up as wire houses if you will and more traditional brokerage business is where they do some investment banking as well\nAs the uh would actually make a market in the stock and then sell that to their customers\nAnd when you say make a market and stuff what is that\nThey would help underwrite it so they would help or participate in the uh initial public offering and so that when the stock became first available to customers to buy those those wire houses would help get it out\nThere and some sometimes they actually would inventories and those shares and so if I'm an investor and I call a large broker dealer and I want to buy some shares of you know American tinker toy\nAnd we're back live is Shelley fishermen sitting in for appeal master I'll let me give a shout out to ray Allen our producer engineer on the other side of the glass is little sign here this is do not feed the engineers but you know um we we\nKeep him very very happy because uh that's the only way you will hear us the way you should uh don't forget if you want to contribute to the discussion seven nine zero uh two twenty forty five to seven nine zero twenty forty Buckmaster hotline I Am\nThrilled to have in the studio today with me or my prior who is my boss or credit union financial network and burned Babylon who is the chief uh\nOperating officer and then resists yesterday's of um Tucson hold regular credit union and we're talking about kind of the the way these these terms work the way these financial institutions work\nAnd things that we take for granted that people really understand and probably don't and you know we kind of lifted off with you rent is going to pick it up with you as well why in the world would have credit union\nWants to have a financial advisor on\nThat um it is very valuable to us to have a financial advisor on staff\nOften times we will have a members that have money on deposits and they will have either more than what the insured value is and they want to put it somewhere else or more than likely they want to have a better return on their money that is in excess of what they need for daily expenditures\nSo we pay a dividend on our savings accounts but it's not nearly what the market can provide to some of these individuals\nSo we can provide a one stop shop they can come in to have the uh the trust of the credit union and then we'll have an advisor that will be hand picked by us to make sure that they're following through with the philosophy of the credit union not so much profit driven more members centric and service oriented\nSo so that that person will\nHave an office or facilities they can use that each of your branches and\nFrom from the perspective of a client or or a credit union member that will resemble in most cases what they would experience if they walk into the White House office\nYes they will um get the very high level professional advice from this individual that will be licensed and trained to communicate on that level as opposed to a teller a member service rep that is trained\nTo deal with credit cards and mortgages so it's a very high level of expertise that has provided to these members\nThat are very much interested in maximizing their wealth\nAnd make prior why would an advisor want to live at a credit union\nGreat question so a lot of benefits actually and ah to brag a little bit about you know what burned has it too subtle public credit union and the not all credit unions are built the same you know so some Canadians have something special and some don't even offer the services at all\nAh it it just all public credit union a certified financial planner yourself as a truly professional financial adviser and so not all credit unions have that you know some may offer investments might not somebody that actually offer certified financial\nOr investments somebody not somebody that actually offer a certified financial planner right and so that's a different levels of advice if you will um\n[noise] so the reason why a good quality financial advisor would like to work with a credit is very like minded a courteous very member focus member century customer centric\nAnd a a good quality financial advisor just wants to take care of people wants to help people you know and so that people helping people kind of ... works well with financial planners financial advisors as it does with credit unions so it's a good fit\nNot all financial advisors would make sense for that model and some are wired differently so they they like the wire house kind of a model a but being an independent financial advisor or inside of a credit\nUnion is get the meat good people you get the help of good people and that's a nice life nice for Vern when\nWhen you take a look at the advisor who lives in a ... a credit union and you think in terms of what makes success or failure in your mind\nAnd your board of directors mind in terms of the job that he or she is doing how do you think of those things\nWe look for members satisfaction and uh we hear the feedback from the members and try to select an advisor that best fits our clientele so that there is a a common ground of communication\nWe'll look to see how the assets build the advisor is is managing\nAnd then we also look to see how well that um some of the money though we liked to have deposits on hand in the credit union we also want to see some of that go into the advisors\nPortfolio so that the members are benefiting from it and the credit union can continue to grow because we have to move very heavily heavily regulated and have to monitor certain ratios and sometimes having too many deposits can actually be detrimental in ratio\nMonitoring and we need to\nPush those off into another sector that they're not technically on our books but yet there's still a part of our membership in the relationship\nSo you're balancing the needs of the credit union and the needs of the members and and the needs of the financial advisor in the community the financial advisor works in uh to to get the balance that makes sense for your business and for the member absolutely okay and then Mike you have a different set of balances and pressures on you I assume\nSure we do a compliance being one of 'em right is where you know that's a or something the credit unions hire us to do to help them manage the advisors so we recruit the advisor we train 'em then we managed a day to day business to make sure that they are uh\nYou know selling products that are appropriate you know and uh we service reduced Sherry's we act as this year he's always have and a set of making sure that the advisors or have the client's best interest first ah is part of our job that part of the things that we're always balancing or to make sure that they're just doing things the right way\nSo this concept of the judiciary and we do share responsibility that you know the word that you you've used and I've used it on the show for several times when we talk about what is the CSP and why is he has to be perhaps different from other advisors what does it do share you mean to you Mike\nDo share responsibility right so legally like a by regulation there's certain licenses you have a three sixty five three sixty six and makes you a a an advisor versus a broker brokers aren't required to have those licenses\nSo uh to be a fiduciary in her mind is always been for Twenty years of put the client's best interests first\nAnd not just to be suitable\nAnd so a lot of historically our industry has been about suit ability as long as it's not going to hurt them it's OK and that's kind of a very low bar or a cross we've always hold ourselves to a higher standard of always do what's right and the best interests of the client and uh we can all asleep at night so\nUh so it it's that concept that really brings your set\nOf the things that target you into into a coincidence or in in too much of the word I'm looking for ... into a uh\nThe same general area as is Vern that the things that I'll give you the idea that it's it's the client during your cases the members ah best interests first\nAbsolutely and I'm like I mentioned the regulatory environment there's one thing I Want to make sure I disclose is that uh we have to be very very cautious that\nOur advisors make it very open and clearly communicated to our members that what the money that are members put with the advisors not federally insured so we have to keep a separation\nFrom what I mentioned about taking money out of there seizing savings account and placing it with an adviser it does remove it from that in ... from the\n... credit union insurance piece of yes there\nThere are security isn't sure these\nAre federally insured by a different regulator yes and you know when we when we come back after the second break I think we'll talk about that insurance and those regulations that little bit more but I'm I'm I'm really kind of interested\nIn in full disclosure I worked at a credit union for my uh and and so I I kinda know some of the answers to these questions but\nOne of the things that attracted me when when Mike\nFound my name and came in and recruited me to work in a credit union was that the\nMeasurements of success we're going to be a little different from working for a company and I work for an insurance company at the time that also did investments where I had a quota [noise] um do you are an investment advisors have caused\nA great question that is that differentiate or an industry is ah we don't\nKnow we basically a don't have quotas we don't have any proprietary product that we sell\nOr we basically can work with vanguard fertility any you know any brand out there a ... job is to identify with the client needs and then go find it for them help them get there and that is different than a lot of the other firms of\nThat is a big difference that you don't manufacture and he brought All right so the financial advisor at a credit union is not obliged or in fact can't sell products that you manufacture because you don't manufacture and so you have to take\nTo make contact with those members but we cannot give him account information and contact information directly\nSo so when I Walk into a credit union I Will not expect to see an investment advisor behind the counter for working with the tell her to identify suitable members were\nInvestment opportunities most definitely you will not they are in a ... office almost invisible but not really and it is a referral situation so\nOur um employees of the credit union when they recognize a situation where member could benefit from an advisor will mention too that member oh we have in our case still McNulty over here would you like to go talk to him you might be able to get a better return on on some of the um extra dollars you're having your account\nSo you do some training of your client facing staff to recognize opportunities and to tell them inappropriate way\nTo make those referrals yes it is strictly a very basic and simple referral they cannot give any kind of financial advice referring to securities they can get financial advice on a checking account savings account and money market account\nBut when it comes to the products that the advisor will provide those employees are absolutely\nDirected to not try to give any kind of financial advice because they're not licensed for\nA Mike it feels to me as a somebody who worked in a credit union but also somebody who worked uh outside of the credit union environment has a financial advisor that that might feel kind of restrictive how how do you deal with those\nThose kinds of situations where those restrictions\nA win win interviewing a financial advisor who says well you know maybe I Want to do a radio show and attract people from the radio shows can they come into the credit union to [laughter] sure [laughter]\nUm well see it's not it it it does sound kind of restriction but really it's just all about transparency right as long as the advisor knows you know here's how it works you know and then the\nUh it's it's very clear clear to the client the member when they come in and this is how it works you know the advisors maybe an employee of the credit union but he's really an advisor of the broker dealer price so keeping that wall up you know you know making sure that everyone understands what's insured what's not insured\nThat's just trends parents of the consumer transparent so it'd visor coming in ah like I said the seats not for every advisors some advisors that would make a good fit but those who get it who are very good character good heart you want to do financial planning the right way\nThey like transparency too so they're if they don't see as restriction is is just that's all the processes\nAnd I'd like to talk a little bit more about financial planning maybe in the last segment but ... in leading up to that um\nWhat I Would I Am interested in\nWhat I what I Am interested in is\n\nHow your advisors are able to\nKind of balance the needs of members who might not be the ideal client for wiser versus the needs of the credit union which is to take care of every single member who once that is why it's\nSo we make it really clear in the interview stage that we help all numbers we don't have minimum like a lot of wire house firms and broker dealers have like you know you have to have two hundred and fifty thousand before someone will actually talk to you but they give you an eight hundred number if you're a small account\nWe've never operated that way in Twenty years we've always just we help everybody comes to the door you know get started so\nObviously sometimes you do a ... maybe a lot of paperwork to help somebody get started but it still is your sense of like I'm helping somebody you know and that's what it's all about right so if you you get that sense of helping somebody or you know we we see enough members we help enough people of high net worth\nA although at the most complicated estate planning and a business businesses and helping them with business planning that you know it all balances out\nI got it um in\n... in the financial\nServices industry one of the things that is I find very unique about what financial advisors are and who they are and how they work\nIs that they're really entrepreneurs they're independent contractors in many ways um rather than employees off\nAnd as as a result they have an expense dream that they take care of on their own whereas if you will work for a corporation as the marketing manager all of that would be taking care of for you so are some of those kinds of expenses\nTaking care of because you're in a credit union as opposed to say if you were working on your own just in the industry\nAbsolutely and the others have been interviewing advisors for Twenty years in hiring in training and Rick advisor for Twenty years and\nWhat do you get to find is that this is kind of like a best of both worlds model if you're an advisor because you get to remain independent you know no one's giving proprietary product pressure like some of the bigger banks you might have those kind of proprietary products\nAre so no for credit to get to be an independent advisor without without all the headache of\nA building an assistant marketing all this stuff that costs and marketing is a big deal a for an advisor one of the hardest things to do is find that next new client\nAnd so with a credit union you know you're getting ill are connected with those numbers and it just makes you you have to spend more time with clients doing financial planning that if you were out there by yourself just trying to run your own shop\nI got a what I'd like to do is have you guys think a little bit about word expertise\nAnd how
