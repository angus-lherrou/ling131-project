to nominate people and those people should be given\nCivil e a hearing and then a vote\nNow I assume that the Republican Senate would have voted no and that would have fulfilled the process but because they didn't even give him a chance Merrick Garland now we have this this I think is a contributing factor to what's happened over the last months on Kavanaugh\nMe I Want to build any civility has to work both ways may I offer may offer respectful rebuttal\nSure\nI think\nYou suffer from the disability of not seeing that the rules have changed that when you're dealing with the Lenski heights civility at some point and you know absent profanity\nI Charles I could buy that if if in fact Merrick Garland we're all in scale\nNot Merrick Garland the people who nominate the the people who who nominated him\nBut he but he was by all accounts a decent man at a good judge you and to the point over and just everybody on both sides of the aisle is going to sabotage this process every time it happens you know in in an earlier book of mine called good order mhm\nThis was back in about two thousand and when I was Nineteen Ninety five I think anyway I I I said look you know the left is moving further and further away from believing in the process mhm but the thing is the pendulum swings\nAnd boy has it ever swung now ... we'll see how far it's one we get to the midterms\nBut and I'm not you know I I Would never dream of predicting that anymore because I I honestly don't know what the heck is happening in this country but\nUnless we hew\nOn ... not on specific policies but on process process is key you cannot separate our system from its constitutional established processes ... I did a book also I'm back in two thousand cynical smear tactics which was subtitled liberal campaign to the fame America\nAnd and in that I I did for the reader or a couple of quotes that I put side by side and\nThey were policy statements\nIt's some of it had to do with foreign policy some of it with foreign policy some of it with Social Security and you ...\nThey didn't seem to be too much difference between them and they were in fact the Nineteen fifty six and then also later it same deal with the Nineteen sixty platforms to the Republican Party in the Democratic party\nBack when we all basically believe the same things now you are right that the brake has come primarily on the left\n... Republicans make a mistake when they\nAllow that to justify a breakdown in process because I don't see how we're going to get out of it my friend a father James of the show that at the column for the hill and the other day in which he said that this is the year we finally admitted that we're no longer one nation under God\nAnd you know this split is becoming greater and greater who is we\n... apparently the the the nation at large sure there are people who believe we're one nation under God but there's a whole very substantial number of people and I'm afraid it's growing\nWho don't believe take a look at the polls and what they show about belief in God and about ... particularly religious practice again back to process all sorts of people say well I'm\nI'm I'm religious or I'm I'm I'm I'm a Christian but I don't but I'm not religious they say ...\nI mean there are sitting there in Europe kind though you're saying there kind knows Christians in name only\nExactly exactly and and there were you know there are Democrats small the people who believe in democracy in name only oh\nWe're dying those people who believe in in in ... you know in the Republican in name only right Republicans in name only well he just passed away\nWell see I think Jeff Flake on that list too right I Know speaking of your state right now and we're going to have a\nSea change one hopes hopefully you know a fighter pilot is not a rhino one hopes\nWell I Hope that I Hope that all across the country\nThere is there's going to be a surprise\nFor the left obviously they now know that for at least a true generations Thirty years\nThey're not going to have control of the Supreme Court ... they're just not going to go and go ahead go ahead you're right I mean but I just hope that some ... ... have you know look I'd hate to get partisan\nPartisanship as a part of our problem here [noise] you know 'cause again I I really do like invoking Nineteen fifty six Nineteen sixty not such a long time ago when we were on the same page and now it's like we're we're we're you know we're descending into the Thomas Hobbs you know war a ball against all\nRight ... choice yeah Cain said I'm going to go I'm going to go back a little bit from your your author Mr Cain said then quote if you really believe that if his conservative on the Supreme Court could destroy forever the abortion right\nThere's been bestowed on millions of women by a few left his members of the court and the parents then you may feel duty bound to keep a potential justice on such a position by any means possible\nOr the present situation seems to exemplify such garbled ethics why should this why should it be so murky in other words why should why should these ethics be so unknowable now all of a sudden\nWell listen you know at my friend Austin Ruse um\nLikes to refer to what he calls the pelvic left\n[laughter] this is this was all sort of come you know it all comes down to say abortion was in the background here but so same sex marriage and so's right you know sexual freedom and and the whole loves pornography yes that that was the title of my columns that's why I was referring to it right and and you know the thing is\nIt's sin and if you don't believe that there is such a thing as soon\nAnd you know and particularly don't believe that the things and this is one of the big controversies as in the Catholic Church going on right now big meeting in Rome where they they're that looks like there may be some proposed changes to Catholic teaching about homosexuality for instance\nI mean it it it's inconceivable that that could happen to okay I understand\nThat people are passionate up to particularly homosexuals are passionate about you know what the way they see themselves mhm uh Anthony Kennedy you know basically in in one of the famous Supreme Court decision said that people have a right to determine their own destiny to sort of thing [noise]\nYou know it was called the sweet mystery of life opinion\nAnd they didn't as Young Frankenstein yeah in fact close sweetness tree of life I thought it would do [laughter]\nAnd it could be that the mid term will shock us and I just don't know I mean there are as I say I like the Pew Center but but that's Martin because I'm reading their work on religion not their work on politics\nAnd I think they're they bring a a level of objectivity that they may not be bring into politics but I Can't say 'cause I don't read that stuff on politics but the point is we'll see in November\nIf in fact the Republican Party maintains its majority in the Senate at least through twenty sixteen and then it Mr Trump is reelected and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress increase\nWell then they are liable to be to work court appointments the current president I then we have one branch of government that you know will at least to keep the brakes on\nThe wonderful replacement I Hope for Ruth Bader Ginsburg wintertime comes is the lady with the seven or eight children ... what's her name the Catholic or do me a\n... a Cook County ... county beret\nYes ... ... yes I think she would be just the perfect replacement for Ruth Bader Ginsberg how ...\nA lot of people thought that some sort of going with her in this nomination differently because the Senate had approved or like just months ago\nWell selfish early I'm Glad selfishly I'm Glad he went for Kavanaugh\nWhat worked and I and I'll say this for for President Trump who whom am I got to say I'm not a huge fan mhm um but I certainly like this part of his presidency and the thing he did that I think\nSome other presidents Republican included might not have done but Reagan did certainly if he's stuck with them and\nSome other politically oriented guys medicine you know what Brett I'm Sorry but I'm going to have to ask you to get back to the nomination I'm going to find somebody else you know when he didn't do that\nNo one that courage is Trump of a lack of courage\nNo alright recklessness whichever it is\n... well he he shoots from the lip as they say All right that we have a a caller who's always got a good point Carl you're live on liberty watch with bread minor of a complete complete gentleman and most recently sons of St Patrick's your comment or question\nHe has a actually a there's a comment from Isaac as most snow we are in the midst of blood as last time a seldom crisis with internal strife blinding us to the bigger external threat\nTo mandate the tourists took this instead of the culture wars will continue to lead to the system collapses on external threat Russia sliced China's both\nRefocused is the country and there is no guarantee which one will come to pass\nBrat so Carl standby for ... bread would you respond\nWell I I um I I take the point I think the point I mean I I sometimes I have my older son a part of the reason I was at West point is because he he was a West Point or and so we're very connected to to West Point we do a lot of things up there anyway I'm\nI'm not even sure that if there were that\nExternal crisis say well what we're really talking about is what World War three or World War for whatever it is\nAn order\nThat that would necessarily but we had another Pearl Harbor didn't we and there was a momentary I mean I'm thinking about nine eleven and then it was a momentary sense of of the people being one\nBut that changed radically overnight you know so you know\nThat was the normally open switched to kind of closed for what am I yeah\nYeah and and and so I think I Would argue that nine eleven was not necessarily a Pearl Harbor because a fool harbor you have a well defined act is enemy that you can pin down\nTrue quite true and and and so what what really is the reference in in what you were quoting is for\nTruly another world war where armies face off in the way they do and and there is a true existential threat to the nation itself would that bring people together\nI'd like to think that it would but you know there are just as we were talking about the diminish them in a real commitment to religion forgetting about people making you know flapping their lips about Jesus or or any other figure in religion\nWere having a failure also of education [noise] primary education secondary education and then certainly in higher education young people are not receiving the kind of education that we did particularly in the history of the United states and for that matter in the history of the world in political theory in a religious principle\nThrough the world in political theory in a religious principle and it it it mean in in the Catholic Church one of the things that we're up all spend a lot of time decrying as they is that the death of ... of actually\nLearning the faith that insects and thoughts as we got this big fat book called the ... and you can learn everything there is to know about the Catholic Church but people\nDon't want to learn it because they want to continue to just think what they want to think and if you're not educated in the reason why I say often in the in the complete gentleman you know one of the art types that I talk about is the warrior\nAnd part of what a shovel risk man recognizes is that there were things worth fighting for ... and the complete gentleman is willing and able to fight and if you don't believe that if you believe that there's nothing worth fighting for\nBy by I was the editor of the American philosopher ...\nWe're going we're coming up on a break bread please hold on Karl ... lip read finishes point that I Want to come back to go ahead\nWell I I I said they said you know referring to the better read been dead thing that was popular back in the fifties and sixties or is it that are dead than read well he said you know he was he was talking about the liberal view\nThat people were saying it's better to be a red than to be dead ... said\n... and and he said yeah it's it's you know better to be alive jak open a deadline and that's fine for jackals but not from in ... a man if someone who can say that he did not sacrifice in principle and that is willing to die for which true\nDotted Carl you're a one sentence or to follow up\nYes a progressive are definitely willing to fight look what they did with capital of liquid and treat them\nYou know I don't think that's fighting though it is it I mean that's like you know people in that children a schoolyard screaming insults at each other mhm yeah you know it but it's called making rattling noise we elect to central threats I don't know interesting that they would fight\nInteresting okay interesting ... points on both sides are we're a little bit behind on the brink let's catch up with that

on this program in two thousand fourteen welcome back a Mr Roberts\nYou Charles so much for having me my pleasure is uh\nHow you felt so much for having me\nMy pleasure is I Love to say I'm Glad you could be had\nThis is a really good book it's compelling and it makes you I Try like the Dickens to interview non fiction authors\nAnd I only interview about someone about a book of fiction when it has great relevance or proposes something in a way that so plausible than it actually acts as a teaching tool\nAnd your book actually does do that\nUm the age of conflict with ourselves which in this case is in your book has risen to war though not only know what\nAre their similarities in that with today\nYeah in fact there all the ... get a lot of the uh the plot\nIs fashions around the the headlines of the day I mean you could you could rip the headlines and on any day in fact I'm just ... the Kavanaugh hearings\nUm is a really important piece of my book\nBecause um when I was writing this year ago um I knew that the deep state and the Democrats will do anything possible to try to keep that seat on the Supreme Court and not let it go conservatives\n... and there's the shirt tried but they only play book is kind of old tired and worn out is the same darn thing they tried to do to Thomas Clarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One and then like Kevin revised it at all it's it's awfully transparent what's going on when you have\n... you know poor ms for pure poor doctor for it I think she was certainly the victim of of some kind of sexual assault\nBut I really the eye can see zero evidence that it was Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah I agree I mean it was a total witch hunt and uh right you know they keep they keep losing the vowels like this and how far would like go in in the book or in this case a Supreme Court justices actually assassinated and turn the turn of the court\nRight and the and it's a pretty effective or well at least at least until very far into the book it's a pretty effective uh technology ... of of how they do that and I won't give away anything in the book because people are by it and read it again is called purge on the on the Potomac\nAnd that's pretty good this is is there one or two previous books in just to earn their\nThere's two like you can read any one of them without reading the other side of their their fashions so that I tried to ride and worth something I didn't have to read every book in the series for for it to be relevant\nMhm um talk about the weaponization of the press because it's a very important a factor in a in your book the purge on the Potomac\nWell it just carries through at the same thing we got today is that most of the liberal media\nIs in cahoots with the left with the progress is and um you know you know I I\nDon't think the media is very liberal at all\n[laughter] I they're probably not they're probably just I I mean it's out in the right you know when I was I'm fifty nine years\nOld Charles I growing up you know for somebody to be labeled a socialist or communist was was um was almost terrified today it's a badge of honor and you\nLook at look ... look at Ocasio what's her name and New York\n... exactly and you know not only talked about the two thousand election I nobody wants to talk about Trump battled like that's the biggest story of that election I think the story that election\nIs during the Democratic primary you had a than about social over twenty million votes in the Democratic primary ... scary and it's very scary\nRight any any sounded any sounded a affable doing it to\nMake sure everybody wants something for somebody else on somebody else's pay for it right\nUncle burn up right\nYou know what it's like Margaret Thatcher said the problem of socialism it sooner or later you run out of other people's money\nI you know social does only good for the socialist easily the socialist elites\nYep so going back to the weaponized press in your book it's sort of it it it's very ... between the press and the left in the country do you see them as being as being I'm having a modern equivalent in the real world\nAbsolutely in fact it may be worse than the real word than than what depicted in the book um it's just if you go back and look at some of the things that have happened over the last three or four years\nWith the press is finding out you know they're giving the Democratic opponent all the talking points that advance of debate\nYou know trying to resolve that yeah\nYeah the down to Brazil issue um it's just a the ... the news coverage and um you know it's um you know they ... the ah I I'm a big free press guy ... ah [noise] 'cause we've had some issues with some of our books I'm getting a censored\nBy certain booksellers like Amazon but I'm\nI'm so this this this the idol on what they call it uh other than\nIt's a ... between the media and the Democrats they all think alike they they work together they can tribute to those campaigns yeah there is no more free press as as we know it\nUh which were somewhat a guardians of liberty and the government is watchdogs over the government now they're they're they're ingrained in the deep state state just like the left isn't there's folks that are Republicans that are part of the deep state to the states that you know the gear crafts that you can never get out of Washington\nUh-huh so David if there isn't a free press anymore what are you talking to\nWell you hit you you've got to go a ...\n... and it just ... it's about a friday it's contemporary to the people in Texas the the battle of the Alamo is if it was last week\nOh that that's that's exactly right you never um outlaws it deep at our hearts and always will be not such a shrine yeah and uh people people really knew the story and it really you know for that matter it's like the American columnist because um if you\nYou know a lot of these folks that fought both those revolutions for were wealthy for their time mhm or they had businesses that basically you go league or farm 'cause most of the society was aggregate area and then um so you leave your farm you leave your business\nYou put your your life at risk your families like the rest of your business at risk a delivery and um you know I I I Would venture to say most people with trades security for liberty yeah um but thank God folks back then the\nRepublic if you can keep it and they truly did pledge their lives their fortunes in their sacred honor and all that anyway back to your book which again is a purge on the Potomac\nYou've got characters in a realistic in other words\nYou got a guy who's a former Navy SEAL was recruited by the CIA CIA which does happen that's that's absolutely how they get some of their people some of them come up organically through the CIA system and some of them are you sometimes to conduct and sometimes a kind of recruited from other areas of service\nInto CIA because of certain specific talents or abilities\nBut this guy's not some Superman and she's not some superhuman and he faces some great challenges and uh and very very tough decisions [noise]\nIs that sort of pattern on people you know\nUm some of them are um our personalities\nYou're kind of disappearing you're kind of disappearing us a little bit sorry you're fading um\nThose are those are a personality that I've met or it could be a blend of multiple personalities of folks that I've met mhm and uh uh there's nobody one particular person in the book it's modeled after somebody's usually character traits that fulfill different people have not over life\nNot even the famous Texas Ranger\nOh my goodness I Wish I could have met him\n[laughter]\nI have met a lot of Texas Rangers and and uh um there are um they all seem to have some of the certain traits that you'll see what this one and for for those that haven't reading my books that that character and one of his remains throughout my books just pops younger\nIs ah the ... of the Texas Rangers to report to the governor of Texas and he's um nobody really knows how old are you in those days eighty ... eighty five um buddies you're you could you could take ops younger\nTwo thousand Eighteen and I mean back in Texas in Eighteen eighties would he would fit the profile\nOf genes just wouldn't St wrangler [laughter] no no [laughter] ...\nOr leave I Am not sure which but I suspect strongly that after some of the ... been pulling lately that there's going to make sure their wrangler is not leave eyes on your next book [laughter] anyway fail or one of the things that you talk about there was a congressional was really good scene in your book about a congressional hearing\nAnd you can see who some of the people are that the book is patterned after like the senator from Kentucky and uh it in talking\nIt's patterned after like the senator from Kentucky\nAnd a ... in talking about things like abusive defies a court I'm not even sure why we have a secret court in the United states anyway I Do know the principle behind it but I think it's outlived its usefulness but you talk about you detail in through the uh the the the plot device of a congressional hearing a senatorial hearing\nAbout the abuse or the ... system which you address that a little bit\nYeah well first of all I I always tell people to show me were in the constitution advise accord is even a ... you could even have a fight and says well it is an inferior court right\nI mean it is if you're in court agree they elected to 'em\nBut is that it was it that responsible to um it's not a parent you got other branches of government can't even get documents showing that Congress has a doctorate so by the court I mean hundreds I\nWon't get any pay 'em you know ... ... and I'm very suspicious that just my nature to be suspicious of anything the government that doesn't get the the uh [noise] uh uh something like ... ...\nIt's ... ... government entities that can operate in secret or you're you're going to have a problem and and I I'm a really big Fourth Amendment guy\nA along with the second amendment but the fourth dilemma guy for invasion of privacy and um this goes back to the national defense authorization act and write all all these things that we're worried labeled after nine eleven to protect us get actually to use that are being used against us\nYou know they are so I'm a southern vice of court or the fact that that Congress can't get director ... ... or can't get it from the FBI it it's just a\nBut you know it gives me plenty of fodder to write about\nYeah anyone who thinks that privacy isn't in the constitutions simply has not read the Fourth Amendment I mean what is being secure in your person and possessions if not private\nI mean I ... I Do not understand that people say well we're privacy is modern or ... it's like ... you know they either have rectal cranial inversion going or they're severely myopic the people who think the privacy isn't in the constitution privacy from government intrusion into your life\nAnd that was one of the basic tenets of the people who wrote it in those of us today in the modern society who don't grasp or comprehend that are either ... you're willfully blind or ... or their whether they're lying [laughter]\nThat's the problem you know I'm One of the things you talk about in the book in in this book the book again is perjury on the Potomac by David Thomas Roberts\nIs the federal invasion of elections\nAnd the danger not only of federal lies in elections but also of of tampering with them and I'd like you to talk about that in in ... please feel free to take your time doing so because we've got about three and a half minutes in the next break and I and I really want to this concept to percolate into the audience\nWell some of this show was Charles brought on because I had the opportunity to meet a potential he has to like get lost also blower if if you see it in DC\nYeah you're are you moving\nAround All right 'cause you're you're getting kind of worldly so maybe get up a little bit higher\nAre you in a house that he'd better yes go ahead\nOkay um [noise] they are\nSo I got to meet with the ... the a whistle blower hasn't come out yet\nAnd um some of the things he was telling me a a you know the more we go into the electronic lectures or the more problems that we're going to have it if you look at\nUm what is it three or four weeks ago an eleven year old was able to hack the Florida secretary of state's office that their Lexus IS electric chainsaw results election hacking into action and that's the news and you look it up it's after Google everywhere and all those do but\nThe thing that I'm finding out is with some of these elections like this he described today in detail how if\nUm you could change the election talent and it's two thousand six the president's election ... found is it six states than it was slowly election Hillary isn't the type of things that really it really kind of scary and it was a little bit a little more and more like Charlotte you look at West Virginia\nIs now allowed at all I'm asking the votes by I fell\nOut it's very very dangerous and then um there's been loose too in in the book\nWhich is like what we said before or you've got\nA a awarding contracts for Dolly systems for basically the software that was a Lexus or for which is another legal to me um and then I moved to a you know today somebody ... says they break fifty different\nElection systems because that there are controlled by fifth the fifth state ... its federalized really at one place to go to break\nAnd won fairly easy place to go according to Mr stone [laughter] that's correct yeah I just\nI you know it to me I don't understand how someone can be that willfully blind as to not see things like that as a threat to the American system you know in the leftist screaming about\nUh uh you know about collusion and about Russian interference and things like that and yet you know they don't say a word when we interfere in other in other countries elections like the Obama and his chief\nTried very hard and overt lead to a to interfere in the Israeli election he even sent his ... his chief election strategist to oppose net and you know I mean you know talk about huts but\nYeah it's a tech and that's a Texas where\nIt is [laughter] and you look at a you know just an ad that I read three post\nOn Twitter or what Democrats calling out for you know um because they they lost the presidency which means that they lost the appointment to the court the Supreme Court all vote to get rid of the electoral college ... huge mistake yeah and um\nSo what do you get a you know popular vote and all that for college and then they go like chronic it's over to be like it just like Joseph Stalin set is not\nWho votes the kennels it's who count the votes\nRight yeah my grandfather was the last Republican who ran and no one who won in Illinois by recount\nYou're a voter referendum says that we want to leave with your own thing whoever it and\nIn fact in the Texas Constitution that that's the people reserve the right to do that it's in the first two aircraft with the Texas Constitution\nIt is and and most people don't ... you know Texas the went to the game by treating because of the country was right in acts like another state or territory right so I'm a ... a few people know that\nEighteen but where do you say I'm right\nRight but you know this whole argue about the Supreme Court like up there was a there was a court case in Eighteen Seventy called white versus Texas right and uh so a lot of folks behind her out on that are safe was settled and an eight sixty\nFive ... well ... go ahead go up well it'll tell\nYou that not nothing was settled they it's five except that they were at Lincoln managed to get out of the people feel\nRight and what he what he what Lincoln proved was not whether or not there was a right to
