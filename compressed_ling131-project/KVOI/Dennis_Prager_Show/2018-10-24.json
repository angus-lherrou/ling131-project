two propositions on the ballot that folks are have in front of them they live in the city of courses prop for oh seven we'll talk about that in a minute that's the one getting a\nThe most publicity there is another proposition that I think folks are I don't know much about what is that one\nSo this is a situation where the state government is mandating move even number elections we really don't want to do it but we want to be able to go to court said don't water\nWe want to be able to say that we're doing our best to comply with the charter changes that the state required to put out\nSo what we did was we put this on the ballot knowing uh if if and when it fails uh we'd be able to uh\nTo court and say look we asked the voters the voters didn't really want us to do it um it it\nThe way it's set up is that it actually gives me an extra year in office I'm for it I got news for you I don't really want that extra year after without earning it if you\nIf I get reelected all around it the right way uh this is this proposition it merely\nSo that we can have some ... state because this is them trying to mess with our charter and you know and he said the joy some autonomy and it should be able to uh ... the citizens of the city should be able to decide when they have elections are not\nAnd putting a putting the city election uh on the same ballot I'm an even years as everything else you're really going to get a hurt I mean the city elections get hardly any publicity anymore anyway but then you put 'em on even years is going to get Bert\nUh anyway but then you put 'em on even years is going to get virtually nothing\nRight a lot of things will be locked in the show so I I uh I'm On the record as as being against this proposition a and a lot of people have called and said why are you trying to sneak another year or the answers I think it starts at ...\nSo that's a that's kind of what's going on and uh I Hope people don't know\nSo we have your ah parks and rec director on the program friday he'll be our friday focused interview Mr Dennis who will be going over the details for the parks and connections bond proposition for oh seven what are you hearing around town on this\nWe had a pretty good response\nEverybody's got a park story everybody uses the parks or something everybody got to have a good experience with a family gathering or their kids played little league they walk their dogs of their dogs social time or they play tennis so they go swimming that's what our parks or for\nIll at the end of the day the government's job is to try to enhance the quality of life\nThe best way to enhance the quality of life or our citizenry to have quality parks we were going to be equality city we have a quality quality park and then the other question you have to ask yourself is what kind of ours\nDo people deserve and and this is kind of where we got hung up over the years then you have it enabling legislation that kind of hampers what she can stand impact these on it kind of hampers what you can spend in parks and all of a sudden\nWe had some situations where our part started to get old and we wanted to make capital improvements on him and be cut they were a replacing something that already exist if you couldn't use impact or\nSo is this big impacts the account not allowed to use and a ... ... e instead of being able to use it for a brand new parks because we couldn't afford to maintain the parks\nThe park's got to a point where they were basically like the roads in the last few years\nThey were just in bad shape you go through thirty monsoon cycles eventually your grounds going to be on even in your sprinkler systems going to be antiquated especially when you're a grading the rest of the water infrastructure around the city\nAnd you have a sprinkler system in their parks it's four years old so all these things kind of hampered in when we started looking at our parks and saying wow\nAh we probably need to read at ground level it out so well trained properly we need to replant ... grass we need to replace playground we need to re plaster pools\nAnd we couldn't we weren't allowed to use any impact\nSo the ... and now we're so far behind even with the impact the money with over ... teeny tiny debt the bond helps us get all that back in ... and it it basically says to the citizenry ahead what kind of parks you are\n... you want to play on a nice grass you want to have it so that the uh romano's aren't falling apart you want to have playground equipment that's rotated out every five or six seven years\nThat's the type of stuff we have and then there's some maintenance pieces to it we're going to work with the school district when I was a kid he practiced actually at your school during the week and he played your games at the park on a nice grass\nOr I think we should probably go back and look at those practices I think we should probably go back and look at some of maintenance ... past as well as we're right now we have less kids\nAre in some places play sports at school and more kids playing in clubs now we have more clubs a lot of times that you find out is that you'll have three or four different entities operating one sport but it's the same eighty three kids and they're going through a different thanks so are those are some other things that go on with park I've been very involved in that\nUh we just read it just Ellen ... to ... billion and a half dollars almost two million dollars a when you consider what we spend on sprinklers and an automated system and I got to tell you the result is unbelievable places just transformed I go there probably at least once a week and and it's it's packed\nEvery night from four to nine or just people there and you know we we were there there's all those little things you take for granted it parks\nYou need that you probably need to redo the bathroom or the toilets every few years you probably need to replenish the parking lot every few years ... and you know no offense is to read and Mr Mr ... ran our hearts they did a great job they built all these wonderful facility is we have\nOur parks Tucson but bottom line is is that we have got to be able to pay to maintain them and this bond package will will catch us up the best thing about this by package that people's property taxes will back go up\nThey will we will double A. a them getting decreased by two years but they'll actually go down lower in two to three years so it's a pretty interesting\nUh situation was a good opportunity and we felt this was the right time the timing was right we have a new parks director named Brent at the guy's a rock star and he's done a tremendous job hitting the ground running he got all that stuff done it just you know it's\nAll right let's go to the live line that seven nine zero twenty forty hello Greg how are you\nDoing well build a welcome back you're saying they shut me up to snuff and Paul Paul though\nTwofold question for you ... uh the salaries that you folks get really don't seem to they could not quite up to what I think they should be so the salaries of the council people you're the mayor of it commensurate with other cities or size head fees if\nRaise was in place a significant raise would be able to devote like yourself do more time to the city's needs a less going away to another job\nGave you if we got the same amount of safety Nick Scott which is there are three times bigger but\nUh they make about eighty or those guys think about eighty five eighty six thousand year which is pretty much the the the going rate around the country or cities with more than a half million people which is worse Tucson ball um if I made that much I wouldn't have a second job\n[laughter] accomplished you guys be able to accomplish a lot more when you yeah yeah I mean\nYou're right now for four thousand dollar your job and I'm I'm doing it all the time I mean I'm Still putting forty hours a week and Greg I'm there even though I'm a teacher I'll do two things tonight I'll do this interview to death in a meeting I I Do a medium practice and just about every morning I mean\nWould you characterize yourself as a people person do you love people\nI Do I Do I like working with folks and I'm I'm I'm a fixture I like to make things better and I like to help out and I'm just\nFrom my life experience I tend to help the folks that are in the most dire need\nA ... what you know I'm just curious and I think our listeners would be to uh how much do you remember about your dad when\nMy dad passed when I was eight so I don't have a lot of memories and I didn't I didn't live with him when I was growing up so\nOddly enough you know a lot of my memories of him come from stories that that folks will tell me and a lot of the stories that I'm told people will come up you know twenty Thirty years after his passing and they will tell me something that is so vivid in their minds left a huge imprint\nThat even now it is a just a front and center of their their recollection and that's a great way to learn about um what people loved about him and you know some of the the crazy fantastical stories they have\n[noise] and I kind of have a I have a very soft spot in my heart for the ... gallery in the sun for my twenty two years on\nA on channel six on Arizona illustrated they were one of our primary underwriters so uh I got to know the people up at the gallery ah back in the day very well and there was the the fire so what is the updated on how the galleries doing\nSo the ah the gallery is doing well they the restoration is getting to completion because the Chappelle was a historic building there were a lot of permits a lot of folks from Washington that had to come out but\nI'm the fiesta Guadalupe is still going on in December I'll be there with my band as well as a ... and lost without us I'm the formal reopening of the Chappelle I Believe will be some time either toward the end of this year or early ah twenty Nineteen\nYeah that that's usually around the December events around December can't usually yeah it's a I might be December ... one of the the Sundays you know kind of early in the December kind of great way to start off the holidays\nGetting back to the campaign what do you want a listeners who are perhaps undecided and there are a lot of people out there that\nAre undecided and haven't filled out about what would you like what message would\nYou like to give them right now I think\nThe the most important thing is uh my values and where I come from and certainly what I Want to focus on and legislature is getting a a stable funding stream for public education\nMaking sure that we pay attention to a D.C has to have some changes I'd like to make their\nUm making sure that we work toward and affordable health care system for all Arizona ends and implementing some commonsense gun laws and I'm getting back to using solar and renewable energies or or putting that more forefront so that everyone can partake\n... the whole thing with the department of the the\nThe whole thing with the department of ...\nD D and now it's department of child safety ...\nIs I knew they changed the acronym again so uh it's been a mess it has been yeah\nUm yeah and in my work I've been tracking a CPS induce yes foster care uh back to you about Nineteen eighties in the federal system to kind of figure out how Arizona got to where we are now\nUm as a a trial attorney there a few changes that we can make in statutes to make the process better but I think overall looking for more preventative measures would keep a lot more kids from harm if we look at a mental health services or substance abuse services or just like I said education and employment\nUm those cut all help out substantially and after two thousand eight we saw a rapid decline in funding for those type of preventative measures\nAlright Domingo deGrasse uh how can people find out more and where would you
