Prager\nHeld um [noise] yeah well they say you're here that although I watch actually doing this projection because the wise that use air from the left of all I can you tell on a daily basis I have two examples\nBut I mean here's one because Michael clarify the first one before me the second line and you tell is that there's that lasted\nMore violent or what is the first one what is what what is that what is the first line that I felt I didn't quite hear it\nThat there is no anti Semitism in America\nI have never said that ever well you said there's every day but I'd like to hang up on you could ever whatever I've never said I I should the United states is going to\nGo ahead what is my quote\nThat there isn't rampant so anti Semitism in the United states\nAll right so right so wait a minute you understand the difference between their recent rampant anti Semitism and there isn't anti Semitism so you're first statement was pure ally about me do you if you don't acknowledge that I Know\nMy first statement was up here why I miss quarter Geron off you sat there isn't what happens I it was All right that's correct\nI don't believe there is no it's not Samantha my friend if you think that's Samantha ... you're probably not an idiot okay so let's go on there was not rape and anti Semitism there was not granted raped ... racism is not rape in a rape culture with colleges which is all left wing hysteria that's correct that's my position next\n[noise] number two that\nThe left out of the violent ones and there's for example I can point to that happened this year alone number one is a size shooting here that just occurred number two as a pipe bomb sense\nNumber three is the running over a woman in Charlottesville number four is no dry commuters that cello our people our help a Muslim woman in Seattle there's only gotten one incident of violence on the left and that will stay stories about Gabby Giffords was shot as well\nOkay I report the violence on the left I don't deny that there's been violence by individual writers the difference I'll tell you but I Believe the differences we make simply defer\nOh but it's nothing to do with lying so you should use the word unless they're really use ally in the first one obviously wants to let me make this clear yes you are but the left does go left lies professionally okay but I didn't ... you didn't you didn't catch me on one lie\nOkay the first one you would make you lied about me right if you'd have to use the L Word you admitted it\nI never said there's no anti Semitism in the United states you probably have told your friends Dennis ... said there's no way to take some of his many us you change it to know rampant\nOr with regard to violence okay let's talk about that for a moment because this is a very serious subject\nThere are people on the right who do violent act absolutely it's despicable as despicable as despicable because violence political violence is despicable evil I I don't know what other words I could use the the ... evil it's terrible there's no question\nBut a lot of the stuff is not clear for example or do you know that the b._b._c. and others have just have just reported than it is a major event with Matthew Shepard a on the twentieth anniversary I Believe of his murder and it is it is depicted by the left as a a a homophobic murder but in fact\nAs a gay writer himself revealed an end to generally understood he was not killed because he was gay he was killed by a I think it was a former lover in fact\nSo it's a it's one of the rampant lives of the left this is what I mean so a lot of what is ...\nIt's a it's one of the rampant lives of the left is is what I mean so a lot of what it's called white when violence or the or or a member of the attack was it an Orlando on the gay nightclub it wasn't attacked by a homophobic what's he didn't even know it was a gay nightclub\nBut it's all depicted as homophobia that's what I mean this is what I mean by by the lying media\nAnd ah with regard to violence yes there are individuals there are individuals with so called white wing agendas who committed acts act of violence that they're they are outliers worth despicable okay usually sick but nevertheless they are what they are\nBut with regard to the daily attacks of of screaming at people uh at shutting down ... ... let me let me give you one example which I think ... the entire issue universities I have a picture I'm going to\nPut it up on the I'm going to put it up on a on\nOur Facebook page will put it up a trigger you page will put it up but that is pretty good dot com took a picture last night of the guys two of the guys who guarded me at Colorado State university these these two are policemen are who are in a sexually uh army guard they they look like they're they're going to fight the Taliban\nDoes any left wing speaker in the in the country meet such guards at a at a university wider only conservative speakers need armed guards at universities why\nWould that be your face just as much violence from the writers from the left why why is that how can the most radical left wing speaker meets no guards at a university why did what Ben Shapiro went to Berkeley they spent six hundred thousand dollars for a yarmulke wearing Orthodox Jew to show up at the Berkeley\nSo stuck with your lives please there's no comparison there is no comparison

T. sounds voice for trusted news and local talk let's get on the live line right now and go to Phoenix former Arizona attorney general rent woods is with is a\nFormer attorney general and of course a long time a confidant a colleague of the lead US Senator John McCain grant how're you\nDoing guys Bell's good to be with you\nThank you always a pleasure you wrote in the op ed piece in the Arizona Republic back on September twenty third that the celebration of Senator McCain's life and the giant whole life by his death has caused me to reevaluate my own life house a grant\nWell you know I think um\nWe we we knew that um\nYou know that this was coming with John for for most of the year or and\nCertainly the six five or six months prior but then when it happens you know it's um you're not really prepared for that or how you're going to feel or how it will affect you and for me I think I'm\nA his death and then I'm all of them you know amazing response from around the country and around the world or that happened in the week after that\nReally it really struck me on affected me a profoundly and I think that probably the main ... a few things I mean certainly I Am\nI concluded um but I guess our always knew but didn't say enough and that was a how lucky I was lucky we were\nThat John McCain came to Arizona and that he was part of our lives and that he was our senator and um then it made me reflect on um where we're at ... and ... am I doing enough basic uh John was all about duty honor and country\nOr that just those were just words that drove his life but it drove everything that he did it was a sense of duty and obligation to serve his country and um I feel\nThat I've done that in my life by um you know I did I did read it and I I served as attorney general for eight years and I've certainly been active in supporting good candidates\nEspecially John McCain over the years but now he's gone and um the country in the world I that gives him and a\nLot of turmoil so I just have to decide um\nIs it okay to stay on the sidelines now or a without John around do I do I need to step up and do something whatever that might be fun for the Senate or or maybe there's some other way to serve but I just I Am feeling like I have a duty to do more than I than I'm doing right now\nLet me ask you did your mentor Senator McCain talk to you about this and perhaps a run for US Senator or something else\nYou know not so much a um you know believe he was always been um supportive of anything that I did or wanted to do\nUm and ah I think he would think you'd be excited about just the prospects of but um we didn't really talk about it because you know for um\nFor most of the time uh we we're hopeful that he was going to make a comeback and I'm a you know we knew the odds John ... the odds are we're really slam with this terrible disease\nBut we also know that if anyone could do it it probably be John McCain and um I'd say right up until um probably early summer late spring late spring or that's one of my kind of side are going a different direction and uh you know been at that point\nYou know I didn't want to talk about that and frankly it wasn't on my mind what was on my mind was just spending as much time as I could with John and also uh just contemplating a magnitude of his life\nLet's talk about how it would work if you did decide to go for senator would you change parties would you become a Democrat would you run as an independent what are you thinking right now\nThe green valley news and read a science writer [noise]\nThis is bill Buckmaster green

with Shelley fishermen right now is Shelley how are you\nSir I Am well bill and back in Studio after a couple of weeks so good to have you it's great to be\nWell you know this is volatility with the capital the on Wall street yesterday was one of the biggest swings or in many many years\nOver six hundred points intra day wow and uh I Believe it was eight years since we've had an interest in the swing of that many points and of course the market wound up very much lower we are in correction territory are both the U.S and the and the Jones\nOr in correction territory based upon highs in September and when we take a look at this much volatility it's hard to say on any given moment\nYou know where we are but in general worry about where we started the year so we're we're we've been\nYou know very high up to the end of January and then pretty low again but we're about whether the U.S started the correction be healthy corrections always healthy\nUm we've had gosh I I I wrote this down let me just get get the sheets or is exactly right since the bull market started which is\nMarch tenth of two thousand nine we've had twelve drops of at least five percent and five corrections at at least ten percent wow so\nWhat what we see is even within a rising market we do see these corrections or they are very healthy they're required a and there's nothing to panic about unless you have something fundamental in the in the economy or in the market that is changing and that can be shown to have the call\nThe market that is changing and that can be shown to have caused the correction but in this case there are lots of contributing causes to this volatility but but no one thing I mean we don't have any bubble bursting around us\nWe have an election coming up we're going to have rights could be uh raised in December so today we go up over three hundred points but who knows\nExactly so the the effect of elections where you go to get this kind of out of the way\n... always create uncertainty especially mid term elections that are typically go in the opposite way of the party in power\nA what we have seen in the past\nWhen uh the Republicans are in power and the Democrats look like they're going to take control as we get some concern on the part of businesses because it seems evident that a tax cuts and regulation loosening regulations are going to possibly be reversed or or halted\nWhat's interesting is after the Democrats take over a for a period of time the market goes up and in fact\nWhen we take a look at market performance over the past sixty or Seventy years markets do better on the Democrats and in fact\nOf Lebanon recession since the end of World War two nine of them have been during a Republican administration so uh some of these results are counter intuitive and I would suspect that whatever the results of the elections the market will shrug it off by the end of the year\nYou know I Want to call our listeners attention to the business section the errors and yeah and we start to do it yourself financial planning under the personal finance category some good tips there\nThey this is a great article you say you're a financial planner rally or why in the world yeah that'd be because that way in competition that um so\nThe the the worst kind of interview I have with a potential client somebody comes to me the mid fifties as in their mid fifties has done absolutely no planning and is looking for miracles\nSo from from the perspective of a financial planner yeah you know this person comes into my office with million dollars worth of assets to to invest their kids are already out of college and and they they had been doing financial planning all their lives that's just perfect\nUm they're going to make money I'm going to make money everything's great twenty five year old comes into my office in the first job isn't married ah and and is looking to do planning\nI scratch my head and say you know over the next Twenty years of your life is going to change dramatically Seventeen time how can you please how can you planned but there are some things you should be doing right and those things don't necessarily require\nA sophisticated financial planner there are things you can now access online\nAnd through the robo kind of plant or a functions that you can get for many of the broker dealers that will really give you the kind of help you need to get started\nWith your own financial plan and allow you to see what you're comfortable with what you can afford\nYou know if you're working with somebody like me at a young age yeah we're going to talk about insurance we're going to talk about for one k.'s and getting involved in your employers retirement plans and all of that but there's no great wisdom there these are well known things and so\nUh I Would say anybody listening who is forty years old or younger should read this article because what what comes out of this article is the need to do planning\nThe need to do what you can to secure your own financial future and to get wiser and wiser and better and better educated in these areas then at some point you know if if if things work out well for you you know when to seek guidance from somebody like me\nThere's some really common sense things here like starting with setting a budget create your own little rainy day\nHave fun and I tell you that five hundred dollars yeah it's amazing how many people\nIn this country don't have and the number that was in the press reports was don't have four hundred dollars set aside for emergency oh my goodness and and what you should have the forces maybe three months of expenses set aside now you say well wait a second at Seventeen kids I I'm I'm I'm Eighteen\nYears old and and I'm In an entry level job how in the world can I can I Do that it's very difficult I get it that it's very difficult\nBut uh it is really something that should be in the back of your mind because things do go wrong in this world and when they do the last thing you want to fall into is the need to\nMatch that your credit cards at Eighteen percent interest where the need to get into debt situations that you can't get out of or bankruptcy or where the kinds of things that just disrupt your life\nSo regardless of what your\nAbsolute earnings or anything and it's like you're not making a lot of money now or whatever you should be thinking about within the constraints of my personal circumstances what can I Do as an individual\nTo begin to think in terms of the future\nAnd my financial future and that kind of rings true with his article in the article does I think very plainly is say here's where the resources or if you get into trouble here some other resources but but if you're not in trouble and you're looking to plan these are this is a good way to store and I agree with every word of it\nIf you're investing won a thousand dollars in your twenties or grown to nearly ten thousand three hundred dollars after forty years\nYeah Albert Einstein said one of the strongest horses in nature this compound interest [laughter] and he was right\nIt's a really common sense things and I didn't realize that uh the average person doesn't even have said four hundred dollars to cover some couple of\nMonths ago that that the district was was published and it it it is kind of shocking but
