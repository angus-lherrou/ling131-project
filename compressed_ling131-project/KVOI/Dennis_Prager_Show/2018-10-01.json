Sanders care goaded don't touch my Medicare dot com now\nAnd speaking of now my guest Sean steel Republican National committee men Arnie Steinberg who wrote the book you should read whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political I see but right now we're going to someone who wants to challenge them peed in Houston teacher on with mark and Mike is\nYeah I think they're going to call it an incumbent a side thing and I think it was meant as a joke but um I didn't catch with one of your guest said that all of our\nFemale through in there it's we're actually going to know and if you're you know it's not an issue that I I understand either I'm not\nI'm not real pro or anti because I just don't understand where they're coming from what you're trying to turn off\nThe last few college educated women and moderates from voting Republican senator trying to convince my liberal wife that Republicans who is just the sending them for a misunderstanding decided that exactly the kind of nuclear unnecessarily stupid from that do that\nYeah no I I understand well I I ... I said it and if it did that a I'm Sorry I think it was a like a joke I don't think it backfired I think that\nSome of the candidates are running for the Democratic party are making such an an issue of the entire matter of transsexuals them in surgery can all the rest there that it's become kind of a a a farce there because it becomes part of their public persona part of their platform\nYeah I I\nI I Would say though that it's it's so ... I'm a person and I don't have a\nDog you know I just I understand your point I Would say your point and I think a lot of conservatives Republicans do say things that are that if they want\nTo let them be silly and we stick to what's right I get them to act like and it's let them for example here's public that\nFew off ... ...\n... ... especially when the ... my wife you know I I live with my love of the um they have this this very member you know the Republican or a senator that don't understand what the you know I think there's there's always been recording their heads and those comments like that\nIt was his own record in their heads and those comments like that wasn't them right now the fact\nThat I Do agree I thank you for your call it's a gratuitous come in and I just want to move on because there's so much I didn't mention that over eight hundred dead in Indonesia quake and tsunami told me rise so we gotta keep all of this in perspective we care very much about our country [noise]\nBut I'm not undermining that in a sense but I did want to report that also the prosecutor questioned Ford shreds her case for its case I guess not her own a five page memo uh I just wish I had done that sooner while it was going on as opposed to who have read this mark what is your second or my artist my question\nBut she she had a terrible for me I've never seen a prosecutor being able to ask a witness questions in for five minutes then have some uh some defender of of the witness or a disrupt the flow\nThat's the fault of our Republic of the Judiciary Committee that acquiesce to them\nYeah and it was an experiment to try to have a female sex prosecutors done this for Thirty years and it turns out our experiment with something so important in the ... well on the other hand they they they you know the big argument at the time was you know you want a female asking questions well she's extremely well qualified\nOr she did she had a terrible form at the bottom line is read the reader letter it's it's on the let's\nDo that now I'm just going to do the points that the the one in June ... hold on one doctor for does not offer consistent account of when the alleged assault happened Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name when speaking with her husband is number three with her husband talked for change your description of the innocent to become less specific\nBack for Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night and question\nDetails that could've helped corroborate her account five\nDr Ford's Kennedy ledge assault has not been corroborated by anyone she's identified as having attended including her lifelong friend six Dr Ford is not offering consistent account of the alleged assault seven Dr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events\nRelating to her allegations center testimony regarding recent events further raises questions about her memory and my question courage you should have done this in wrap it up Dr\nFourth number eight descriptions the psychological impact of the event raise questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely effect the doctor for its account and I think these are all great point\nBecause why why did she do it at a day or the the first of all we all could front is that is that we're ... ... these are wonderful points but\nOur whole discussion is all of this was on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing instead of cattle that we have to do it there are but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done properly the Republicans when they're going to have her there that would have a different form and secondly\nShe would have had somebody play the role this isn't preparations there to go through all the possible response to a good grasp cross examined the editor questions with no matter what the answer they know you're a model of quit your day oh what's what's your follow up question goes a long one line or the other there and it wouldn't be any Rupp interruption of the Lincoln there and you look\nYou know I've talked to two to too many are women some of being a had sexual felt some of them out there but the the point that they all hinged on is that this was a girl who was not driving age who said that her her parents drove or places there\nBut she has no recollection of how she got to this party and she just she went downstairs out the bathroom and somehow got home without telling you seeing anybody telling anybody else at the party like I'm leaving\nOr somebody attacked me or I don't feel well just ran out the door did she hitchhiked whatever why didn't the prosecutor asked earlier than that I have to tell you with somebody who's been involved as a consultant many lawyers and in in cross examination than in some several criminal cases\nThat sounded so inherently implausible objectively so because of my political ... are you there because\nFirst of all you would have expressed gratitude the person who took you always Oh thank you very much or even if you watch all the details a gift that would have been arguing wouldn't remember that if you don't remember how you got there maybe we're too drunk or the ... there but when you left you had to ask somebody for a ride and somebody would have been considerate and said did you get home okay or whatever\nMight mark I could I have to defend Rachel a Mitchell sheesh for Thirty years she's been investigating and prosecuting literally prosecuting sex crimes\nShe was building

I'm sure you were as impressive as I was with Lindsey Graham who finally said well we were thinking right\nWell let's see ... grade was plain spoken or where he talks you communicate very well and\nPassionately and that's consultant saying that and it was it was a great surprise surprise me there's been a transformation Lindsey Graham course she ran against Trump\nAnd he he brags about the fact that he got up to one percent so so so he's got he's got a good you know a streak of a self self reflection and humility a but he he was he really captured the essence of what most Americans believe and believing most Americans are with us\nYeah well I don't agree with on a legal immigration but I ... what he did the other day was fantastic but what do you think of flake and others like Collins and Murkowski and all these flaky Republican\nWell there are perennially that way it'd be one thing if on one particular issue they were squishy or they the they had a certain level of commitment and sincerity is this is an issue important to me but it's an issue after issue consciously playing hard to get and constantly jeopardizing the very thin working Republican majority we have the Senate\n... self serving convening yeah go ahead well except that they're going to be voting for cabinet and I finally figured it out ... not withstanding effect that voice quit coping independents moderates not I'm not reliable McConnell's a genius he can count the votes\nAnd are these women are well I guess two of them are women it's like it's like a a certain certainly not and and what we've learned from the from the three maybe hold out is that their understanding one thing if it's a Senate Democrat majority they lose all their committee assignments or they lose Ninety percent of their value and washing dishes don't\nWe don't realize they're not they're not still really don't realize that when the other party takes it you lose staff there and and it's significant\nAnd it's ... you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's call in San Antonio because it says get these two guys are on TALK show oh I give me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows\nHave the Democrat so overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party's been completely taken over by the not clash\nAnd the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been a back venture entire life has kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems and the irony is that with all of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general isn't meant coach airedale Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservative talk about the need to move its all conspiracy and so I I Am against are concerned as they slide it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with a public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC on its own if\nYou whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the of the people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are ... are being kicked out are liberal Democrats there because they were in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who ... could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control\nThan the sexual harassment going to be mainly\nDemocrats well not only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges on one is in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting\nUp and you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a ... well I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is in his politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman's behind and I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold\nThere so that gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence this road they've gone down\nOne less I just this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years there\nIncluding Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have to actually limitation this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school in a in a in a

is\nEverything is considering the same level as rape or a you know and and but\nIt's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it

interesting question because uh\nObviously there has to be legislation for that and uh we do have midterms right around the corner\nAnd so we'll see uh the question is I'm a ... either way I I suspect obviously the administration will try to push it through before uh before the end of the year so that way they don't have to worry about the impact of a of a new Congress\n'em by the same token that may or\nThe fact that there will be a new Congress and whatever the makeup is that might push some of the current members to you know depending on both sides out some will want to push it forward and

live listening on my website Buckmaster show dot com [noise]\nLooking back it is the Monday political face selfie viewers care to join us we'd love to hear from you our ally blind number seven nine zero twenty\nForty Jim Kelly a season to my right and Vince Rob ago is seated to my left we kick things off talking about NAFTA but before we move on to another topic I Do want to say that the Monday political face off has brought to us by most a gallery and find framing\nFor all and dodge General Motors gallery dot com old of course by now uh everyone in America that has a pulse has an opinion on judge Kavanaugh\nWhether or not he was telling the truth or whether Dr Ford was lying or whether Dr Ford was telling the\nTruth and the judge was lying I mean everybody has an opinion Jim Kelly on this but I ask you and vents does this judge or have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nWill I said it does I mean he's been through six confirmations already is on the on the ... circuit he's been a very good judge of four years so\nYou know you put the kind of pressure that got put on on him and the circus and sham and the constant barrage of a of of whether it be the coat paint people or or whoever all of these protesters were\nYou sit at a table and every Fifteen minutes be interrupted by screeners\nOr behind you and have to stop and I mean that's a lot of pressure and I'm telling you I've I've seen people come out of here in rooms generals admirals ... ... did sweat it through their entire uniforms and and it was nothing compared to what Brett Kavanaugh went through\nWell one of the reason I bring it up is because the judge in his interview with Fox the night before I think it was the night before maybe two nights before\nThe uh the Thursday hearing he was like a a completely different person he was very measured and then uh and then he got before the committee and you know he lost his temper\nYup yup but I'm going to tell you something that's that's what happens when where people are accusing us things that you know you didn't\nWhat do you think that's you know I I I I think that the issue that you bring up is one of the most serious and a issues that has not been people are focusing on the substance of of the allegation right as they rightly should be I'm not really focusing on the Senate not has not been enough discussion you know our e mail ...\nFocusing on about ten or not has not been enough discussion you argue Melbourne for example a hit this right on the head and that is that he let his mask fall away or at this most recent hearing where he went on a partisan\nPartisan political diatribe\nA with an substantiated allegations that this was revenge for for Trump being elected and and I and revenge on behalf of retaliation I'm half of the Clintons and that this was essentially that the left like a left wing effort against him\nAnd and the reason why that is a very significant and I say that you know I Would be saying this if this was a a Democrat that it said something similar about Republicans so they understand how serious I I Believe this any person that says or does that\nTo me automatically disqualifies them for for purposes of this position you go back through every single a Supreme Court nominee who has been grilled and and things have have have been brought up about their back on whatever it might be\nNobody has essentially gone to that level and then promised ah like I Will get back at you you know this will this will come back at you\nAnd and so they have a job that shows to me the absolute or inability to have temperament and this issue of oh this was just ... he was being attacked you know what people get attacked and committees all the time I saw Hillary Clinton go through about twelve fourteen hours of testimony grilled mercilessly\nOr by by the the majority Republicans and she didn't crack yes and\nNo she's not like it or not like the ... All right now but\nShe did not and see what but I'll tell you the other thing even if you say she did get what she was enough for Supreme Court lifetime appointment but the other part that was just from a from a a a balanced political perspective is\nNot one has ever gone on to a conservative and a well known ideologically a partisan TV cable networks like Fox News and try to push their case\nOkay I I Want to hear vent vent you make a compelling case and I want to hear a beside the Hillary Clinton's your church you know and I want to hear your response to events about this whole temperament thing and and the Irish telling you\nIt is a very rare human being\nThat could sit through days and days and hours and hours of testimony and be yelled at screen dead accused of everything but being a human being which\n... the end at the end when the Democratic senators that are doing it who before he even stepped foot in the room vowed he would never be\nOn the on the Supreme Court\nWhat do you expect I'm Sorry I just ... that losing his temper uh is nothing because being in that position being in that position that the litter out to all of that time nobody interrupted Mitt sport\nHe was constantly constantly in\nHis ... what about this issue that Vince spring's not just about the temperament for the partisanship the partisanship not an absolute ... there of course it was there and in the garage and vowed to destroy I'm Talking about his ... he vowed to distract I'm Talking about his part is if if you're not addressing that is that though that's the ultimate\nLabor and that's what we're talking about that's what I'm Talking about and what I'm saying is that if somebody if if there's a partisan group that is after your knowledge even that is not wrong\nThat's not what he that's not it at all that's not ... you know what if you were serving on the high Supreme Court you're there to be a neutral arbiter and I'll tell you what\nThis is a job interview I can remember the ... this is hypocrisy at its best because the Republican Party refused to give\nPresident Obama's nominee Merrick Garland a hearing they vowed from the beginning that they were not going to give him a hearing so that's hypocrisy and the reality is is is they now when when when Gorsuch got nominated so clearly it's not this vast anti Trump\nOr or pro Clinton thing there was already a Supreme Court justice nominated and then put on the bench by ... by a President Trump so all of that is just hogwash and the artificial deadlines and the constricted\nConstricted a unwarranted self imposed non investigation of these allegations and how it's happening right now are just going to serve to de legitimize are are what has to be a neutral third party are balanced judiciary and it has in he himself\nHad by by by letting that facade fall and him himself becoming part isn't about it he's been a partisan operated that's the problem that's the problem is that President Trump's pick their party's been operative to put on the Supreme Court and that's not right the theatrics that the Democrats put on from day one\nEven before when he was ... on the short list the the the nonsense that they that they have did it done and these theatrics are not going to serve the Democratic party well let's see like fear for the for the survival of the Democratic\nBut let's see if we can get Gary on the show Gary has been waiting patiently hello Garry\nI wanted to address the uh\nAccusation that this up for court ... is the hardest thing is observing the partisan politics especially if the buds are sitting on the paper\nTo release it at the greatest opportunity partisanship I ask you you said any of the others are in court judges are absolutely non partisan\nAll right that's the question for events\nI Believe everybody comes into a position\nAnd they have their past political uh activities are for example justice Rehnquist he was very involved in the the Arizona Republican Party\nAh but the reality is is when you go on to the bench you have to leave those uh that partisanship behind and what was laid bare is that is not left behind\nWith this particular nominee now look the president has his right to nominate a a judge to put them on the bench they don't but nobody is you know I'm not disputing that\nYeah sure it has been some over the good news is there's no the rhetoric tone down from the Koreans as well as from the United states and number two South Korean president moon\nOr South Korea has been working hard to build better relations with North Korea and that is work\nSo I think that's a that's an element the north Koreans also have registered at bat military activity there's no uh testing of weapons and there's no uh\nActivity that leads to the risk of war\nBut it's interesting aspect the same problem with the same issue in the United states why don't you acquire nuclear weapons you don't really need to test them any more\nSo you know nature irritated other countries so the north Koreans have an arsenal they have to complete that arsenal that's the downside we've seen no progress whatsoever upon the north Koreans giving up their nuclear weapons\nAnd I don't think we will see that we can see them\nMove in that direction of what they're doing now of less hostility and also moving in that direction of allowing inspections of North Korea no testing of weapons no export of nuclear materials\nBut that's going to require inspection so I I think there has been progress so\nWe've got to move further but giving up the nuclear arsenal if we think that's going to happen I think we're living in and I have a dream\nLiving in the twilight stuff on there you go a general way come at the first summit that occurred with a with President Trump or do you think there'll be a second one\nYes they are planning on that and moving in that direction as part of it at all attach a quieter heads the summit in Singapore\nThat's because you could bring in a media from all over the world to real PR fell out of it and I think we're going to do the same thing again\nAbout the issue has got to pay what can we do in concrete ways to get the north Koreans are moving the direction of constraining nuclear arsenal wherever we haven't made progress there at all [noise] All right\nScott Horsley run do much in that direction if I were in North Korea and I would not want to give up the nuclear arsenal or if it has set on your program before the founder of North Korea Kim Il song\nWe're in war we're losing their Korean War because we don't have nuclear weapons and we're going to get them and they have ... and the grandson Kim Jong un\nIs not going to give up his arsenal or without some an enormous quid pro quo from the west and I just don't see that happening\nAll right let's welcome Matthew to the program after you go ahead\nMatt you're always had a question\nDoes the more he really does doesn't he we were always welcoming Matthew to our program go ahead Matthew\nOh I appreciate that\nI'm sticking with Korea as a general\nAs you may know the uh the hearing for the new incoming commander General Robert Abrams it\nComes from a very distinguished family a ... I'm sure you recognize a it will be taking over\nAnd die it's it's pretty clear that he is cautiously you know at dealing with the reality of the of the president's decisions regarding\nA his talks with a with North Korea um\nBut uh it just says a quick aside its wonder you know ... uh let you talk about him for a second ... I think the American people will be hearing from him in the near future\nUm the second thing was to things real quickly a General Mattis\nObviously switching to Asia I had to cancel his meeting with China or for high level defense hawks and at the same time we've just recently in apparently incurred\nAnother a warship a aggression in the in the\nIn that area I'm from the Chinese Navy um so what does it say about the entire Asia a securities out of that we we continue this to continue to draw than to provocations are both in North Korea and China\nCan I ask you Matthew go ahead general\nAre very good question smash here as usual as yours actually write the Asian situation is going to continue to be troublesome China is now the leader\nIn Asia because we have advocated our role as leadership in Asia to our our trouble I Believe and uh so we're going to ... trying to play more of a role number to the south China is like the Caribbean\nAnd and America and America as China a southern white influential in that area and they're going to continue to do it despite the fact that Philippines and Vietnam\nA have a role in the south China shape\nBut China has stripped theory or role and showing you have to work with China in that regard and recognize their responsibility and their solver role in that area but we need to look to minimize the risk\nOf conflict with ships and were their plans and we can do that let's not provoke\nLet's not provoke China\nOh back to Vietnam I mean back to North Korea Abrams going into south for he's not I don't believe he's related to ... the former chief of staff I don't think they're orange got the same name\nA but a quality man August right and it's going to have a responsible at jeopardy there is a commander of forces about a million troops career and you asked a very responsible\nAnd having done that myself a for three years and reject that she had her for me also\nSo it's a big job and then there's no training for that job to go to war or in your way into it when I was only there there was no training and higher deal with a quarter ton insurrection\nOr or or assassination here's solo work your way through the things you can avoid crises yes a mess and that's what I did wrote about that in my book ... on the brink\nGuy was just going to mention that that you did write about that per we're on the brink and the book still does very well uh and it's available if folks are interested on Amazon and the author John Rowland John work um so\nI still do and publication and it was translated into hurry and homework and are over there so for the ...
