Wish I could put out a list of people who said that his changed their lives and I that's what I Want to do with my life has changed people's lives for the better so I Know it sounds corny but it's completely sincere\nTopic today is identity that you are going to be a happier person\nA with more identities and I specifically gave sexual national and religious as examples\nIdentifying as your sex identifying\nWith your nation identifying with their religion\nIt makes you a happier person the alternative is to be what if you don't identify with any of those forgetting the sexual for a moment ... ... you would uh if you don't have a national or religious identity then what are your human just lovely obviously\nBut there is no happiness and barely being human I'm human as opposed to what frog cow\n\nOr I don't I don't see why that gives you any sense of happiness I think we should all care about all humans that's a separate issue that is a moral question I'm not speaking about morality mailing speaking about happiness and identity\nThere's no identity human as opposed to what as I said your mother walked turtle\nI don't see how that can contribute to one's happiness\nI can see how celebrating being French or being Japanese are Being American can contribute to your happiness but I don't know how celebrating being a human as opposed to just ... it all of these or in distinction identity by definition is in distinction\nTo obviously that's fine though\nThere's nothing wrong with that it doesn't mean that others were bad or that you have others that's that's that's what you learn in graduate school but it's not true in part because he did learn to graduate school\nSo I if I if you if you celebrate being French then you're not celebrating are being Paraguay in as that is correct or American that's fine I I think it's great you celebrate being French that's good\nSo long as I mean if someone's there aren't obviously immoral components to your celebration but that would be true but anything\nBut if you're a human you're celebrating um human as opposed to what it doesn't mean anything there was no other things that you could be okay that was important okay

ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely it would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't

over words I Know a male and female or a national identity\nCan I Know one French on Japanese I celebrate it and a religious identity that if you have the more of those you have the greater the chance for happiness so I'm just explaining where you're coming from\nA very interesting like site or about who who what is my family 'cause family was been raised by a court as another source of identity happiness\nOr another identity source of happiness\nSo that's interesting might look I'm not I have I mean in in a sense I have done a lot of counseling through the radio but obviously you you're a professional with this and my and I\nAre certainly honor that fact my I'd be curious than\nTo hear your response to my general take on divorce and children it is not the divorce that is most troubling but what happens after the divorce if parents do not sniping one of the number\nAnd maintain listen we are not married but we remain your father and your mother\nMy experience in life including ... out of my own children has been that that works but so many times like I was a\nLong ways okay yeah it goes a long long ways yes\nWell vats clinical yeah go on\nWell and and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more gas all that's all right dean\nAs parental units I think it's extremely important and\nIn my own divorced that was a not the case was not a what we call a [noise] a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have some major impact upon our children are there's right there are mistakes that I made certainly\nThere are things I was not aware of but uh I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions\nYeah we don't do are not in the lab easily ... yeah you're very thoughtful\nMan and I appreciate it and I think words substantial agreement look life is filled a wave obstacles to happiness and filled with landmines\nAnd how we navigate\nOur life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that hopefully and with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of folks on divorce and I should I haven't talked about in quite some time if I talked about a\nMuch more in the past and I will address it began thanks to this call but\nHe and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorce trial the child's age\nIt's\nIt's very different if the child was too that if the trial was twelve or the child was twenty two\n\nThat's that's it is there's no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results or obscene or when a parent\nThe parent the parent ties as the other parents de legitimize is the other most children are attached to both parents and even if you are right\nCertain you're right the deed legitimize ing of the other parents in in all but the most most egregious\nCases is a sin against against the child against your family\nAh how're you doing there

board but my colleague Luis Casco or is the editorial writer and get a column kind of going through that that proposition in way Dan himself\nThe over you've had pretty much a a brand overwhelmingly positive response you were telling me\nYou spoke I guess you're pretty much on the speaking circuit everyday or nearly fifty groups or explaining what this is all about and you said a hands go up in the room when you ask well would you like to see our parks improve pretty much every hand goes up yeah that's\nRight so we're very encouraging the ah yeah you're right I think last week I spoke to the Peter how neighborhood association and\nIt was a very well attended neighborhood meeting and are actually councilmember ... introduced me and he poses the question to them and like\nI think I'm speaking that acquired and most of the ... already voted also but it's still a great opportunity and be myself and get some feedback in terms of what they were hoping you know if the voters that approved the initiative\nWhat they could hope to see realizes in terms of park improvements in their neighborhood and community park\nAnd it is proposition for seven and if you live in the city of Tucson and\nRegistered voter and I hope you are you will be eligible to vote on this\nMany people I think that early ballots have been out now almost two weeks lots of people have already voted yes in fact ... and this is a overall big picture two hundred and twenty five million dollars\nIn general obligation bonds generated over nine years what's the footprint of this brand\nSure that's a good question bill so the propositions actually title parks and connections so the two hundred twenty five million over nine years we'll be I'm invested in a hundred of our parks or ... I'm\nCurrently have a hundred and twenty eight parks the proposition does develop three smaller neighborhood park so we have three new parks\nOr and then there's um so a hundred and\nThirty three million of the two hundred and twenty five goes to reinvestment in parks and then about sixty seven million will be devoted to what we call connections that's a whole array of\nMobility oriented

focus interview today Brent Dennis brand has been the city parks and recreation director in the city of Tucson since April the twelve coming a directly most recently from Anaheim but he's had experience with\nSan Francisco park and I think there's probably no other city Brett Dennis in the United states that loves their park space like the city by the bay\nYeah I Do kind of miss San Francisco from time to time the uh the unique aspects of San Francisco and just to put it in a proposition for seven context as I think they've had probably the most envious track record of community to support of any\nFunding a ballot measure for their parks and they also have a great a not for profit parks trust that helps philanthropic Lee raised additional funds\nBut have they have a beautiful park system in San Francisco is also the first city to be able to say that a hundred percent of\nAll of their residents lived within a ten minute walk them apart and I think that's one thing that uh for Tucson miracle child scientists onto that trust republic Lance campaign where that would be Argo right now we're a little over sixty percent of Tucson and live within a ten minute walk apart\nAll right let's bring in now Sara Garrett gas in the editorial page editor and columnist for the Arizona Daily Star [noise] so what happens if voters saying now\nTo this ah this proposition\nYou mean besides my shedding tears yes yes I mean look at that meeting with city manager\nSo I actually took this job not knowing about the discussions or the\nThe potential of a proposition such as this so for me I Know my colleagues say isn't it like drinking from a fire hose all the things that suddenly you're\nFocusing on and and for me excited about but I was already bringing lots of ideas and maybe that's why the city manager hired me about things that would harness the interests of you know volunteer energy community partnerships you know having to you of a here is a huge advantage\nUm because of some of their their programs and encourage studies\nAh but yeah we were we were prepared to keep advancing with the resources that we have a being very aggressive instill good stewards of the the funding that we were in trusted but we've initiated a for example power paint is a a neighborhood volunteer based\nInitiative that realizes just a fresh coat of paint on or a moderate picnic tables or a pool a bath house\nMakes a world of difference so that and planting trees and uh just having a you know our adopt apart program and park watch expanded so we were already you know kind of developing our approach to to improve the parks but\nUm I Can't be any more excited than you know doing a cart will and bill studio here that I think proposition for seven should voters approve it it's gonna be a huge huge benefit to the community\nWe talked about oversight or our caller Richard brought that up and what about maintenance of the park so pay people or or if they approve this uh what about yearly or when will the parks it's their maintenance money built you\nKnow so that's a very good point also so the the general obligation bonds are restricted\nTo only capital improvements that doesn't go towards staffing pension retirement any type of a maintenance budget\nBut we do have a a maintenance plan in place we projected that once a lot of these improvements are in place or we're going to need a from one point eight to two million dollars additional funding in our parks budget and\nBuried scouts so when this was given the green light to go on the ballot they directed the city manager to start\nPlanning future budgets to restore\nA a lot of the park maintenance dollars that were cut the other things which I I think are actually more important to emphasize is that a lot of the improvements that we bring are going to have huge cost savings on her current budget so\nTransforming existing park lighting a to Eli de saves a huge amount on our electric bill and also the smart irrigation improvements with computerized\nUh uncensored control the irrigation out so you actually give us healthier turf a areas in the parks are at about a forty percent reduction in our water bill so things like that and also brand new items or most of them come with warranties that are you know eight ten Fifteen Years in length\nThose would be guaranteed for performance and a lot of our current maintenance of dollars that we I kinda humorous we say we buy duct tape and band aids to keep saying limping along\nTo their useful life and we can redirect those as new things are put in place to help take better care of others so I think we have a pretty solid plan to address of how we're going to cover maintenance\nSo right now you have a huge capture the flag I liked her up for your car to take care of the\nUh I've only got about a minute and a half left and Sarah did you have anything else well I'm just wondering at what will be what would part if it passes will park users be incorporated in the construction will they stay open or of all the parks have to close\nNo that's that's one of our more complicated challenges and that's that action plan that will be discussing with the city manager and all the ward offices in that um because voters in the community in general will have been so excited that this passes but yet there's about a year and a half\nWait until they see what's going on with the part right so we're going to be front loading what we called the low hanging fruit there high impact high visibility lower cost improvements\nAh those up in the state of Maricopa have been pushing for wanting to son to have a elections in even number of years but I think that the city's kind of looking to see to get some backing from the community and hoping that people will say no to this\nYeah I think that we're going to have a piece um before the election from from the mayor weighing in on that it's something that\nI'm kind of gets into the weeds and ah the practicalities of how elections work in Tucson is different than other places\nBut it's a something that that is important even though it's kind of hard to explain in a thirty second behind it and it's something that that voters may not really give them much thought to\nAnd Jim you say in your uh ... you're saying vote no on this and your recommendation ah you concluded by saying fair warning if this doesn't pass it sets up a court battle with the state\nRight because of the state has a you know as you mentioned been trying to push the cities across the state\nReally into doing these I even elections at the same time it's all the other elections are held and uh and that's been successful in most cases and their their latest effort a basically would cut to the chase would would take state shared revenues away from the city unless they moved the election even years which is a big financial hit\nA our charter which is approved by the voters a says that the election shall be held and the odd numbered years and and you can't just change that without a voted to people\nSo that's why they're putting it up a this year I think that the argument against it is that basically you know we have a lot to look at in a midterm election presidential election you know the the uh\nThe legislative races you have the congressional races you have the U.S Senate races sometimes a gubernatorial presidential elections propositions\nAnd all the rest a county elections hum so by ... by having the ... elections and the other years you sort of a allow the media to focus solely on on those city issues and\nAnd bring some white to specifically rather than getting lost in the shuffle of everything else that said obviously turn out\nIn the city elections is far lower than it is in a general election so there's certainly an argument in terms of butter participation in the rain gauge meant\nOn on that side of things so uh you know I I just don't like getting pushed around by those guys at the state so we're we're saying vote no uh and that we'll see what happens after that\nThe third a local proposition ah that folks will be considering a has to do with the Pima County road ... this is proper for sixty three Sarah\nAnd uh we had Ramon valid as on the program yesterday and the supervisors admitted this thing goes down there is NO PLAN B.\nRight yeah it's a one of those things that that needs to be done the roads we all know need to be fixed and that has to be paid for somehow\nNo need to be fixed and that has to be paid for somehow\nAnd Jim you at a very enthusiastic yes on this one on your recommendation\n[noise] yeah you know everyone complains all the time about the condition of our roads and I and I think many of them have gotten better in recent years at least within the city of Tucson because ah voters have approved a I'm a first of a a a\nBond package and then a sales tax temporary sales tax in order to get to fixing the roads and a lot of the roads I drive our on our end in much better shape these days as a result of that and I I think we should move forward and start fixing these roads the rest of the ones that are out there\nBecause uh you know the longer you wait the more expensive it is to actually get around to fixing them and they've tried any number of options until they've come to these bombs or the deal is pretty good it's a short term bond it's about three and a half years to pay them off which means there's not a lot of an interest hit 'em that\nUh you get the money you get the rich fixed again the\nThe uh because FEMA counties retiring bombs they don't have to increase the tax rate in order to pass these\nAnd I just I I find it fascinating that the people who are most against this are the same ones who complain relentlessly about the condition of the road it's almost as if they don't want to give up having something to come\nAnd and I I just you know we've we've for I think the caller to your show complains that there wasn't enough money for district one in there so he wasn't going to vote for it and and I find that just strange because roads are uh you know I I don't I don't only drive the roads in my neighborhood if I drive a part of town\nI'm using the ... it's not a very provincial thing for me and other people may not drive that much outside of their own neighborhood I don't know but\nI I think there's also an economic development argument to be made in terms of of ah\nBeing a a more attractive place for people set up a business and and I honestly think it's just a quality of life issue and it should be resolved as it seems like the last best chance to get it done\nSarah this is the time of year that editors like yourself story page editors really do hear from the readers and of course\nUh the Arizona Daily Star has been making a endorsements uh can you kind of give us just who makes those endorsements can you give us a brief overall picture\nI Would be happy to um\nSo I'm the editorial page editor and in the newsroom and newspapers generally speaking um the news side of the news room the reporters for news uh sports features a metro\nThey are separate from the editorial page we're editorial journalists we're opinion journalists um and so we are it's Luis Cosco myself or the editorial a department\nAnd um we and our part of what's called the editorial board which also includes our president and publisher John ... do in our newsroom top editor Jill Jordan spent so what we do is\nFirst fits is not some people think fits is part of the board yeah fits as David said tendons used to be\nPart of the board um there were a lot more people in the editorial department as well but um he is not a a on the editorial board is not weigh in on our endorsement\nSo we invite all the candidates and the races that we've decided we're going to use our resources to a way in on\nAnd ah sometimes usually they accept sometimes they don't like to have them in um all the candidates running in the same race at the same time 'cause it's kind of I mean you want to compare and contrast ah we do a lot of research on on the different candidates ah\nAnd then when it comes time to decide who to endorse we have lengthy conversation\nUm and that that's a John nearly into our president and publisher Joe ... is our top editor movies ... got to the editorial writer and myself um we have we talked about things we\nGo through you know what do we think about their position on education or the environment or economic development things like that and we go back and forth and I know a lot of people think that we\nOnly endorsed Democrats that's totally not true and some people think that we endorse Republicans only to throw a bone to conservative readers and that's not
