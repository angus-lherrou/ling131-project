Dana Milbank he's just a plain hater\nThe amount of heat from the left dwarfs the amount of heat from the right ... there's no comparison the problem is that no sound appear recalled data exist that shows an increase in anti Semitism during the Trump Administration\nHave you like that\nWould justify such claims while the data that does exist like a much cited a study proves no such thing\nUndoubtedly many readers are silently protesting what about the ACL statistics showing the fifty seven percent increase it anti Semitic incidents and twenty seven team a finger reported by NPR the New York times the Washington Post and many other media outlets in fact that's not what this study shows\nWait a minute you meet NPR the New York times Washington Post a line no professor

even purports to show any such thing\nMost important to study there's not actually cling to count anti Semitic incidences such but rather the reporting of these events\nFirst it purports to count those incidents that have been reported to the ... by the media law enforcement and the public\nThe ACL acknowledges that some of the increasing documented incidence is not an actual increase but results from Cold War people reporting incidents to a deal than ever before second the report does not count only actual anti Semitic incidents but any incident that results quote\nIn Jews perceiving

community center ... students early twenties Seventeen even the two perpetrators will not motivated by anti Semitism\nRelated Lee twenty Seventeen sold on usually high level of concern in the Jewish community over perceived threats a result of both Trump's victory and the Jaycee she called Jewish community center\nThis likely lead to an increase in ambiguous incidence being reported to the ab yells anti Semitic we know for example that one purported example of anti Semitic cemetery vandalism turned out to be just old stones toppling over from poor upkeep that a deal deleted that one from its tally and another turn out\nAlright\nJackie in LA gotta solicitation for me a deal no more money from her I agree with you I agree with you unfortunately\nThat's the only the only way they'll stop

story and that's what I Know and\nIn nearly fifty years in the business that's what kept me in the business because I like to hear people start any too yeah\nAnd that's that's the essence of of the book I mean I and the essence of the column I I I'm naturally attracted people who have done a fair amount of suffering in their lives for whatever reason whether it's a war or drug tests\nAnd the suffering in their lives for whatever reason whether it's a war or drug addiction or were overcoming incredibly ugly circa ... family circumstances or whatever but those people fascinate me the most once you sort of\nManaged to show up and the other side a little bit smarter a little bit more wise and and she's on all of that in in in in that the Tucson has its place between this fine line between despair and hope right I mean it's like\nAnd occupies this place between despair and hoping in\nThat to me more than any other city I've ever lived in um Tucson represents that what\nAre some
