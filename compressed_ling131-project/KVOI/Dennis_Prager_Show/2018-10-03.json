...\nThe a former Benedictine monastery once home to the Tucson order a Benedictine sister is a perpetual admiration admiration\nOur admiration had Horatio adoration thank you Steve was sold in October of twenty Seventeen to a local developer who Steve ... knows very well and a consummate ... working with a developer the plans now are to build the multi story\nHousing and business honor around the property and I just received this news released this morning that they're going I had a group or putting together a concert at the monastery\nYeah uh they'll be October Eighteenth and nineteenth and I believe the twentieth a it's a something that Ross erroneous the property owner and for Russia's are committed to keeping the keeping the venue as a public facility or we what what that is ultimately has yet to be determined\nUh people can get tickets for the for the series of concerts that are coming up a two weekends from now a cigar tickets available\nBut that's one of the things that Ross is committed to do uh I was on the phones were on the phone regularly or on the phone with him his latest nine thirty last night talking about different deal points on this\nWe continue to meet a we have we had a meeting and access or two hours or middle middle last week with\nSome of the residents and Ross and his architectural team a talking again about\nAh what is going to Montessori going to look like how how large of the buildings going to be a rounded what are the kind of the the the buffers ah the the question as to\nA mass thing and scale a historic preservation so what we're doing is we're trying to carve out as many deal points as we can so that in October tenth when the planning commission\nOr we read the zoom ditch consideration of this item um we will be able to stand in front of them now I won't be but the the architects and the uh um residents from around the area will be able to stand in front of the planning commission and say look we've been hammering out deal points and this is\nA these are the some of the kinds of things that were you know we're in agreement on\nWe're getting very close I Will say that both parties are at the table and both parties are are are committed to making sure that this doesn't turn into a student dorm or that is the fallback position that are Ross continues to having his back pocket he has been approached\nBy out of state student housing development companies and um\nWhile I have not been a party to the direct party to the conversations a I\nBelieve him when he says if they're throwing they're prepared to throw a ton of cash Adam show to turn this this thing and the property around it into a dorm so I think he's operating in good faith uh we started out he started out at seven stories in eighty six feet in height on the on the market rate housing we're now down to\nA thirty five feet on the country club sigh of about fifty five feet on the north from the south and about forty feet on the east side that faces the neighborhood\nOr the number of units has dropped in half we're still committed to preserving the monastery or in perpetuity\nAnd him working with a group Spike Lee took Tucson botanical gardens and a mission gardens to our preserving transplants landscaping heritage landscaping around is so there are a lot of moving pieces to this thing I Do believe that everybody at the table is operating in good faith and I think it's going to end well\nAnd the concert I we had some uh callers wondering about the details it's friday Saturday Sunday October Nineteen through the twenty first seven o'clock at the monastery it's going to be interesting\nUh the acoustic should be really good everybody's pretty excited about it these coral groups and the ticket price point Steve ... check is reasonable it's Fifteen dollars per concert or you can go to all three for twenty five\nYeah I I I got a couple of them are typically tickets for my wife and her mom or I Would prefer Jimi Hendrix but\nThe and I told the guy that\nBut she will be there or if I'm she spent the last two full days babysitting for one and a two year old much grand sons and a validating the fact that we raise kids when we were very young because I got home both nights and she was face\nDown fast out in bed but if she recovered from that she and her mom will be at the concerts on the nineteenth and up people yeah people can still get tickets you're right though the the acoustics of that place are just amazing uh you go in there and and it was it was built as a as a\nAs a um monastic facility or that they did a lot of contemplative stuff in better part of that were chance and things and so you go in there and you could play an acoustic guitar one end of it and and you wouldn't need any kind of amplification at all\nOkay in all fairness to color shock about the parks are my fine producer ray Allen quickly went back and we listen to that bite a from shocks call to the mayor and the mayor did say that you know her funds could\nBe used the word could be good though so here's here's the ... to ...\nThat is that her funds can only be used for road related projects and so the argument that I made with the city manager and the mayor was that if if we are going to do kind of activity\nPieces than some of those herb dollars can be used for things like sidewalks or ADA things they're not going to be used for building a for building playground equipment they can't be\nAll right not to conduct pivot he which includes I guess by pass to some of those\nAnd the other thing that that we that I laid on their desk is that a great now Chuck Huckleberry in the county uses a county flood control district monies to maintain the loop\nEverybody loves the loop well we're saying what I said to them was if it is true and it is that they use flood control money to maintain the loop than we ought to be able to use flood control dollars for maintenance on our kind of activity the says the the green ways that are connecting are most how you've passed through the loop\nSo another funding source a that is not her scholars a button that are that are dollars that are legitimately use for those kinds of functions but we're not using a gas tax money to build to buy a playground equipment if ... if Jonathan's I don't think Jonathan said that\nIf he if he was talking about her scholars in relation to prop for seven it was only in relation to the road to the streets related pieces like this like sidewalks and an eighty eight\nYes he was only talking about conductivity now what about this team or the indoor team the sugars calls are you on board\nHave you ever gone to an arena football game\nNo I haven't have you\nThe I went to one a day are high octane sensory overload a events or that you probably will want to take 'em some\nHearing protection when you're going to run it they're they're fun\nThey're like the WWE of football and so there you know the the final score will be Seventy five to Seventy and and it's kinda nonstop action uh we are going to host him for seven home dates and it should be should be fun it's nice to have\nAnother tenant another committed tenet T. C. C. uh athletic tenant uh we are actually kicking off the road runners a season this weekend\nAnd on the actually the fourteenth I Believe\nYes the fourteenth and I'm so we'll have you know there then the hockey teams the anchor tenant and I will have the uh the arena football team as the as the second of secondary anchor tenant it's fun uh they're they're committed to keeping the price points down a so that the general public gets in and you're not going to have to buy corporate box seats or anything like that\nUh but I suspect that their demographic is gonna be a twenty five to thirty five fish uh people\nUm who who want to go in and you have a few beers and have a real high octane sort of a athletic experience\nI've only got about a minute any complaints from neighbors about drinking at the stadium and connection to you a football\nNow I think that you know the the the way it was putting on my athletics department had you know we we went and checked out what happened to other athletic Venus who do sell beer and what we what we found was\nYeah we're seeing and we almost doubled our sponsorship dollars so thing\nAnd we almost doubled our sponsorship dollars so being a real interest in investing in Tucson and really helping and support the conference and its growth that one of the things I think that's really interesting about the ... model is that it's really based on a collective impact and so um the goal is that\nUnless the bathroom organization kind of helps pull all this together but we really rely a lot on our partners um to support in programming different pieces content so we've got the College of objects that doing a whole day around\nThe northern cloud and I'm In the data Mercedes we've got a working with um discover or discover local day working with local first\nUm Arizona and all of the partners are kind of support it under that larger umbrella and the sponsors really see that the benefit and that sort of kind of shared collective impact\nIs to downtown Tucson of course everybody knows it's it's really been booming how ... how is that impact how does that impact start up to sun and like this recent article in the New York times about Tucson I mean that was big time\nYeah I think um we're seeing a big push 'em and it started environment we're seeing it becoming a lot more robust than I think a lot of that has to do with the recent activity of your ... and also downtowns emergence and we're seeing more eventual ... venture capital now in this area more younger people wanting to live here\nAnd as we add um you know new\nGreat big companies um with our economic from downtown with companies like caterpillar and hexagon and Samsung and Cynthia all kind of moving into that area I think we're seeing a lot of a lot of kind of push forward in that space I'm not really in\nA it's kind of how the festival was built so all of the venue for the full ten days occur in the downtown area or a long history car\nAnd says it's really accessible we're excited this year I'm to be working with living streets alliance and to go bike to really make it so that it's really part of your whole experience you can come to the downtown area you can get around between the different things\nI'm very easy and that downtown economy um whom is really an important piece of that we also have as part of your ticket um there's different deals in ... with local um with small\nWith small businesses and restaurants I'm downtown thing that you can really take advantage of that that kind of blew me um business scene while you're down in during the festival\nYou had mentioned at the beginning of the interview Liz about uh Austin, Texas and their south by southwest of that was that kind of the first of these these innovation and cultural celebrations\nYeah I think one of the things that's interesting to note about that I thought that does it kind of grew from a model of music into education I think one of the unique pieces that um ten west springs today that we really are thinking about this from education and then we\nKnow that the art um our biggest a big piece of that but\nMusic is is just stay component of the overall conference not the main driver and so we're kind of building this um this in an opposite way of south by and so we really think at the festival continues to grow it continuing to highlight um the amazing innovation that's happening here\nIn Tucson and continue to shine a national an even international spotlight on us as a hub of innovation and creativity especially in these places these areas like just the inability um stem objects some of these some of these things we think of as our regional assets is really kind of a goal I'm as we envision the future of of ten must\n... how did you get involved in all of this SARS though so I um I came to you of a about ... law school\nThat ten years ago um and kind of thought I Would be one of those people that kind of came to Tucson for
