that I just assumed were given like love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage\nThat assumes that love and marriage\nOr some somewhat or automatic you ... you were you horse carriage are pretty much on America's a horse without the carriage and nobody goes in the cards and the character up the horse it doesn't move so they go together and so do love and marriage but it's not true\nMarriages choice marriages valley even value\nAnd we have not taught these values and the and liberty is a value this is the one that shocked me this I I I figured out the one on marriage but this one really surprised me\nLiberty is not a year earning\nLiberty is a value that's correct\nIs correct some of you may know the greatest a project of my life I'm In a gauge then now it's thirty year project and first of all you will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible the first one I'm coming out with this book of exodus\nAnd it's fascinating how the Israel lights or\nLiberated from Egypt and then constantly complain\nOh bring us back to Egypt at least we ate better there or imagined that the better there what is the ...\nOr imagined that the better there\nWhat is the slave mentality the slave mentality is hey\nI got taken care of I got three square meals they they took care of me medically I had no liberty but I was taken care of that is what the sleep mentality is that not all slaves were treated decently to save at least so he is but if you were decently treated\n\nYou weren't murdered you weren't weren't whipped if you did you work\nYou got fed\nLifers route no she didn't have to worry about anything no one to shoot it from your part was necessary\nThat's that's not all that bad the human the human human nature is not\nGeared toward yearning for freedom believe it or not it's not\nYou may think of this but it isn't that is why that book is so powerful\nMaybe it's not such a great idea to leave slavery and it's you know they're all forms of slavery addiction as a form of slavery and we've there I'm not being poetic justice you're you're a slave to\nWhatever it is you're addicted to\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans and before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of the answer is almost always yes and the more that you aren't given those

certified financial planner Shelley how are you and we'll today bill how're you doing doing very well uh we've been getting\nSome real positive news I guess when it comes to a jobs in this country in fact the number is the best since uh I graduated from my undergraduate days in college well sixty right\nSo the numbers that were released on friday uh-huh showed less than anticipated numbers of new jobs down it around and I'm going around the numbers here a hundred and thirty thousand where they were expecting about a hundred and eighty thousand but the prior two moms were were\nRevised upward what was interesting was the unemployment number that clicked down to clicks from three point eight to three point six percent\nAnd we have not had a formalized unemployment number of three point six percent since the days of the deep days of the Vietnam War I'm back in Nineteen sixty nine so that's the good news\nAnd then my clients ask well I don't understand\nHow come the\nNumber of jobs that are being filled every month has been essentially lower in the past two years than it has been in the run up\nThe past six or seven years but the unemployment number keeps on going down mhm so how can those two facts rather than the same universe how can they will you have to think about what's happening to the population of the United states\nSo it takes with with our current population it takes about a hundred and eighty thousand to two hundred thousand new jobs a month\nTo to meet our growth needs in the economy where that growth is approximately two percent to do and a half percent a year now what's the turn what's going on in that in that number\nRight now uh since two thousand and ten\nWe've had the baby boomers retiring and so the number of people leaving the job market\nHas been increasing from its steady state value that we saw for decades and the number of new people coming into the job market because our population has not been increasing as\nBecause our population has not been increasing as a by by the same amounts that we've seen in the past so new people entering the job market has been lower\nOr as a result what we see is that the number of people who are looking for new jobs\nHas come down as a percentage of because there are so many more jobs to fill\nIn so that helps the unemployment number because we see of the available numbers those people who are looking for jobs or the unemployment numbers about three points there's only three point six percent of those people for whatever reason can seem to find a job that they're willing to take\nBut we have like full on them full import what would be considered for unemployment\nWe have full employment down that that this number or it's just differently made up from the way it's been in the past\nThe number is a survey first of all you have to realize that this was a number of that's a survey it has an exact number but it means if you're holding two part time jobs and you're no longer looking for work because you've got two part time jobs you're not unemployed mhm or the other the other\nThing to consider is the people\nWho are leaving the job market right now or theoretically people who are at their highest level of earnings potential earnings and there there was you know essentially a leaving the marketing to retiring but people coming in or people who are out\nThere their lowest ... so what happens is the the average wage is is hill down by by the fact that the people coming into the market are coming in at lower wages than the people who are leaving\nNow what does that mean for corporations\nSo so at three point six percent bill if you if you are a corporation looking to fill a job um you've got to compete to find somebody to fill their job\nThat should be making the wages at the lowest levels of of wage earners a go up higher than say people in the middle and indeed that's what we're seeing what we're seeing is people that entry level positions are in fact\nA moving up word or in their wages faster than\nThan a we've seen in the past it's still not a very good number it's still just above the rate of inflation that's somewhere below three percent with inflation running around two two and a quarter percent um but\nThe the perceptions in the marketplace or that\nThe middle class is is just not surviving this because what we're seeing is is the the jobs in the middle\nUm companies are still getting more productivity out of their their workers they're not reinvest thing the capital that came in with the tax cuts and also the capital that they should simply of sitting on the sidelines for a decade they're not reinvest thing that\nI'm In new new a plant in the new capital investments\nAre in the wages are paying their wages webs are not going to those wages are not going up\nWell they're not going up because there's not a lot of churn in that middle part of the wage earning marketplace the trends at the bottom and at the time\nSo what you're seeing is stability that's a good thing but not a perception that people are getting ahead and those who are entering the middle class or having an easy time of getting there\nAre the good news from investors perspective is that corporate profits are high because the the amount of money churning in in the in the economy is still pretty good enough to support\nHigh levels of consumption and again this is a consumption consuming economy so consumption is stayed pretty high a with inflation going up or if wages don't keep pace with inflation and and with the artificial bumps we're seeing in prices for\nThings that princes are now are going to have tariffs assigned to them what we might see is a hit\nOn consumption and if if that happens\nThen you'll see a hit on corporate profits but for right now the outlook on a quarter by quarter basis continues to be good with with nobody forecasting anything dire or negative happening in the economy at least not till the end of two thousand Nineteen\nOr we facing a labor shortage that in this country\nWe will be we're not right now we're not we're not facing a labor shortage but what what I expect to see is will begin to seek concentrated in certain industries labor shortages or as as those industries where\nThey are the kinds of skills that had been required or leaving because the baby boomers are are retiring\nAnd there are not the millennials trained sufficiently to move into those jobs so unless we see some real concentrated labor a training efforts and we were by the way we are beginning to see that in the largest corporations\nAre we're seeing wage increases I mean we've we've seen in a very large companies now a Amazon\nFor instance going with a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage but it's not just the minimum wage along with that\nThey're training\nHundreds of thousands of people a year\nOr two to ... in in order to meet the needs that you articulated which is to have a certain set of skills that are required\nThey're also concerned as again as baby boomers move out of your upper middle level management positions middle managers move into those positions\nThey need the skill levels from what war entry level and and just above entry level positions to be able and skill to move into those\nAnd here he started out\nAnd then he has also been\nWorking to expand tried to the charter school industry and talk to themselves as one of the fathers of charter schools where as I've been working my entire professional career and our Arizona's public schools I've been an educator and in the classroom I think that's\nThe most important type of experience that made it for this position and that's what's missing we've had\nA career politician after politician leading our public schools and look where we're at we're absolutely\nAn or we've hit rock bottom and I think we\nDesperately need a teachers' voice to to elevate the voices of our public schools and public education\nWhere did you think of the red for ed movement coffee\nHas been a strong supporter I'm In my view of red fat and in the coming straight from I was in the classroom when ... happened this past school year and\nWas ... it ... red for add rose that because of the frustration of our teachers and our parents after years and years of inaction by our legislature to fully fund\nPublic education and after hearing two years in a row that the only proposal for for teacher pay increase was one percent two years in a row\nWas insulting to teachers who I mean that's below the rate of inflation um as you know our teachers can move to any neighboring state and make easily over ten thousand dollars more and\nSo we're losing a lot of our high quality teachers to other states and also to the private sector um I Know one thing I just heard you talking about what is that how Amazon as increasing their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and so this is also an issue that's affecting our schools\nBecause we also need to be hiring bus driver and tear professional of an office staff who right now are making the minimum wage ten dollars and fifty cents and our schools and so now I'm now we're also at risk to lose even more of our school staff to the private sector\nAs superintendent of public instruction you would oversee also our charter schools how do you feel generally about the charter schools\nGenerally I feel I think that charter schools are also doing a great job as meaning that needs a many of our students do have unique needs\nAnd I think that the charter schools do meet the demand of many of our families and Arizona bought the issue than I Do see that there are reforms needed we have seen especially in in recent news that there have been on several issues\nAre playing says of corruption of on legislators passing policies that benefit charter schools and that we have certain like a couple of legislators have been able to profit and millions of dollars at the same time that there are teachers are making below average wages and so that's where I see you\nThat teachers are making below average wages and so that's why the need for reform I strongly support having more transparency and accountability\nOf charter schools because all of our tax taxpayer dollars and the other funds needed aimed at the end of the day I'm all about supporting our public schools and and that doesn't include charter schools\nAnything you want to say about school vouchers and that will be on the ballot\nYes I have I'm always consistently opposed that extension of voucher crops real
