I mean yeah absolutely and so you know and and I remember we ... we we actually lived in Chicago with it at the beginning of my life\nAnd Chicago had television in Nineteen forty eight through Nineteen fifty\nAnd we could see those shows and it was really amazing but I remember a time before we had television when I was just a kid you know seven eight nine years old where we would watch we would watch the radio and listen to those things and it was a real theater of the mind where you think about\nYou know they they they would portray dramas and things like that and and you know it was your imagination that took over exactly well we came first a two sided Nineteen fifty and a\n... one thing was a real shock is the fact that when we came here we came from Chicago where they had TV but Tucson didn't have television yet wow vision didn't get here until Nineteen fifty three\nAnd so um you know there there was no television but of course radio was was a thriving industry but you know I talked about my friend burden I we went to high school together and all we wanted to do is be disc jockeys and in Nineteen\n... I was saying there were two things that affected radio in those days number one was the fact that television was around but the second thing was Elvis Presley and rock and roll yeah town and that those two things just changed radio dramatically\nBut he and I really wanted to be a radio and we finally got her first chance in Nineteen fifty eight there was one FM stations in town and in those days nobody listened to him nobody had an FM\nRadio but there was one FM stations and it was Katie Katie FM\nAnd he and I got a chance to be disc jockeys I'm Katie Katie FM\nYou know nobody had radios

record southern Arizona first record company that's your that's your introduction to entrepreneurship as a Fifteen year old right\nYeah as or Seventeen jobs to live in the Enron yeah okay we we were as old as the uh [laughter]\nSo you know we we made a these records and uh\nAnd Bert and I uh we decided we wanted to go on the record business and of course the record business was fairly simple thing you know you got you made a record\nYou got the record played on the radio people went into the record stores and bought it and the record stores or by the record from you and then when they sold it they would pay for it and that was a very simple thing the only thing that was difficult about it was\nHow do you make a record we didn't know how to do that yeah\nYou know selfishly is a Seventeen year old so we had to fight out so if I I went home for lunch one day in high school and I called up to Sydney Jay Wakefield custom record pressing in Phoenix\nAnd I and I told a Mr Wakefield I said Hi I'm the Seventeen year old kid in high school and and I'm In Tucson and I want to make a record could you tell me how I can do it\nAnd he told me it took about two minutes on the phone and he said here's what you do you come up you get a recording studio and finished there were none in Tucson in those days if you could imagine file recording studios there has to come to Phoenix ... get it\nGoing to go into the recording studio and he said then I Will I Will take the tape that you make\nAnd I will press it and make a record out of it tell us what you want to put on the labels are and that's it tell me how many copies that what you what it will make it for you and we'll send it back to ... it was that simple so that was the first really entrepreneur ship that I was involved in and believe me over the over the last\nForty or fifty or sixty years I've had over a hundred businesses that I've started because that's that's what an entrepreneur is I'd never let her to run the business I ... I was an entrepreneur I Love to start\nStart things in their hand them off and allow other people's\nMoney ... and you know the funny thing was when that guy told me I wasn't management material that I wasn't I wasn't he wasn't right\nI was not a guy that wanted to run the business I uh I wasn't qualified and I didn't like to do it but if I had a good idea I could always get somebody else to do it and you can sell that idea so now you have a book so I've written a book and it's called\nFearless confessions of a serial entrepreneur by ... wild rides with the man who created the infomercial industry the world's most important website and over one hundred different businesses and it's a it's a three hundred and twenty page hard bound book and I'm introducing it this coming\nTuesday over twenty third at the Arizona history museum and all of your listeners are invited to come I'd love to have him come and I will give him a free copy of this book was twenty eight dollars and Ninety five cents I'm going to introduce it I'm going to talk about what's in the book\nAnd it's absolutely free of charge so it's this coming Tuesday October twenty thirty four thirty in the afternoon you'll have plenty of time to go out to suffer that night we're just going to have a lot of fun it's not a book about\nBig business or you know a Mitt Romney takeovers or or accounting or anything like that it's just a fun book with my experiences but included in there are twenty two ... laws valuable tips from start for starting from scratch because I learned the hard way so you don't have to end the first\nThe first Lindstrom law in here tell me that it is number one if you don't know how to do something you ask just exactly at every just about every business I was ever in I didn't know anything about it but I went to find out about well and that's when I asked and that's how zoom records gets done what you\nDid when you were a when you were a kid and you called up that record pressing company ... be amazed at how how um much just one little phone call or one nowadays email or message to someone how far can get you\nExactly and in those days it was really difficult because people don't understand how difficult it was without the Internet biggest today it's so easy to find out things today is got to be really easy to find out just about anything\nBut if you want to do something called you can call people talk to people are always happy to help you out and so that's the number one thing in the book is if you don't know anything about it which I I was in all kinds of different businesses you know I started a newspaper one time what do I know about starting a newspaper I asked somebody how do you start a newspaper and they said here's what you do and I did it\nSo you know like all the businesses that you started what is the one of your most proud of well\nI I think it's probably the infomercial business was the thing yeah that I was most proud of\nUh we also started a thing that you may have heard of\nAnd that was the traveling starving artist art sale which which appeared in hotel ballroom is all over the country all over the world we started that in Nineteen Seventy four and and probably did a billion dollars worth of business during that fire are still people who do that from time to surf but we started that business\nOr we started the infomercial business we started we we were very big players in the nine hundred number business not porn didn't have any of those but we had a lot of really entertaining lines and it was a fabulous business lasted for three years and then it was over with\nAnd then and then in the early Nineteen nineties I got into retail and I had the world's largest watch store in Laughlin, Nevada believe it or not wow we had over twenty thousand watches and we sold more watches now one store than anybody anywhere in the world and that\nAnd and that's got that got me featured on the NBC today show was hard was other things so they do those things were really big but ah you know and and then and then I talk about my foray into the Internet\nWhere I should move over Mark Zuckerberg I'm building the ... the world's greatest\nWere were evaluating you know sort of like what are some additional things we can do to be a better than hand said whether we were able to get some celebrities and or you know things of that nature\nAnd that'll be in twenty\nTwenty one Twenty one and for that one we've already put out a basically a request for proposal\nOr we want a it to be a meaningful a kind of a a thing that will contribute that has has legs and we'll stay and whatnot\nAnd were made a minimum of commitment of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the beneficiary of that so I think we've already had forty
