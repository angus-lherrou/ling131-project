reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next to impossible sex\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and that trial he has to reach out to expand the base not just do the base and try and become the leader of all the people that is a huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes people are feeling better about their job they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the economy they feel better as citizens right now\nThey feel that the country is in a more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way

Pima County ... the chairman is with me I I Want to outlive start on the statewide a chef for\nA and the the first one is prop one twenty five and this proposition is to fix\n'em some problems within the retirement system and to make sure\nThat we're not on some some of the more antiquated a pension plans like we've been passed it'll actually save\nTwo hundred and Seventy five million dollars as well as a a correct some problems in a in a in a prior a in a ration of for this so odd David worry Adam well\nFrom what I the information I have this returns a proposed pension reform back to the legislature ride or for a needed a amendment a\nAnd a lot of people are talking about this should be a yes I'm a the Pima County GOP committee\nA mat on all the propositions and this'll be the first one to talk about our recommendation and there was a there was a what a kind of a split decision on this one\nUh and and some discomfort over the fact that the legislature has inserted themselves are into this one in originally started out being just for the corrections officers I Believe\nUh and so um we took a no position on this not not not no a and that as the tension of a position to make that clear and enter a stain on the sidelines on this ... what do you think\nWell I'm actually for it I I think that we do need this reform to take place and ... according to to the state to the secretary of state's office or they say yes phone will allow the state to adjust certain benefits for correction officer retirees and elected official retirees in order to provide\nFreighter financial stability in the pension system that is that I I think that as a compelling reason to vote yes on this I understand that fair that there is a you know some talk uh in the other direction a but myself personally I encourage people\nDirection a but myself personally uh I encourage people to vote yes on prop one twenty five and this would be a reform and the savings I think overall to the to the pension or a sister we haven't and if you know in other states\nThe biggest problems they have are with other than Russia engine planes that are just ballooning and and they don't have the funds that\nThey don't have the funds to support them and their bankrupting some stare at ...\nAll right let's move to prop one twenty six this is a proposition that would prohibit the taxation of any service that was not taxed as of December thirty first twenty Seventeen\nSo there is a group or who is in favor of taxing they're called Democrats they're called left us\nAnd they decided that they wanted to put a tax for example on things like if you sell your home ... okay uh the real estate commission would be subject to taxation\nThere's all kinds of things that are ... services mainly that are not currently tax or that they want to tax this is a direct cost the taxpayers are aggressive tax uh and and really it is one that should be a no brainer\nA about about voting um uh yes to prohibit any new taxes are on on the citizens\nOf Arizona David where do you come into well here's where we come in on that one um there's a there's an opposite of argument to be made on this one verse that about a\nTax policy at the ballot box or as opposed to in the legislature\nUh and and uh some of the lead legislate tours in particular are are recommending a no vote on this because they they feel very strongly that tax policy should be\nA uh in the area or in the arena of the legislature and not not a direct voted visitors' centers and the ...\nUh so so that that\nYes yang and yang on yes no on this thing also caused the Pima County executive committee to abstain on this one\nHigh so the top one twenty six would amend the constitution to prohibit\nAh this state in any city town countered other political subdivision of the state from opposing new\nOr increasing existing transaction base fees assessments her tax\nIncluding a transaction privileged tax on any service service or right and and that's where I come in on the effect of a decision maker for you\nYou know that to me that was the no brainer I felt that that so so I'm baton to for to yeah and it just shows the people who who have like minded opinions on a whole bunch of different things\nYou do have different opinions on ... and I and I get that part because of pop\nOne twenty seven which we can talk about now is something that are in just a second is something that absolutely uh you know we should not be a imposing constitutional requirements to to use certain energy a you know a sources in the future and kind of locked us than\nWhat what one twenty six I I feel does\nIs it it is that keeps us from from\nThis kind of a huge tax that could be imposed upon service people around the state even in my own industry or this will be a huge impact because I'd have to charge or a ... a you know attacks on property management services all of our customers would be impacted by all of our winters as well and I guess at\nFirst to get that are quite well but there is no movement to do this right now and I think that's another argument that has been made a to vote no on this says it's if it's if preemptive is to make sure that ... something like that doesn't happen\nAnd if you fall and we certainly have seen city of Tucson was some of their tactics trying to increase taxes in trying to\nI think the role on on the state of Arizona and and again my feeling is\nA this is this is a tax that is something that we should not do here in the state of Arizona friends if you have a your opinions on it let us know Raul ears okay we're going to go on to prop one twenty seven were probably you know we're going to go to the break you're in a in a in about three minutes or so so we'll we'll discuss on both sides of the break\nUh where do you ... where do you stand on this personally David I Am down to where we go into the\nBreak on this one on the ... this one is absolutely a no brainer\nThat this is a no uh and I haven't ...\nHell no I don't know why the hell no this is a hell no\nUh you know this is a the toms dire a initiative to mandate in the constitution\nOr that we go to a uh what what he calls clean energy but that doesn't include the cleanest energy which is which is Atomic Energy which has nuclear\nUh and it's going to it's going to shut down or yeah or the you know our our verdict ... shut it down or you know this this is a hell no this is ... out of our state uh and get this crazy California idea out of our state\nOr in his imposition of of what California did they want to impose that upon us for that yeah I I suddenly it's not they is Tom style right you know he's up with the state of California centrally they passes I mean they did a concert and and that but all of them and their energy prices have risen three times so\nAnd I want to talk about that for for just half a second uh we have a house or over in California uh our bill a for electricity\nOur home there which is a fraction of the size of our home here in Tucson was Eighteen hundred dollars each month in July and August of this year\nAnd this is this is all baked into this problem that that comes as a result of prop one twenty seven Eighteen hundred dollars a month Eighteen hundred dollars and because what they do is they've also they've ratcheted around demand\nA and and you know what they charge when they charge at so you know they force people for example you know to prepare meals earlier in the day okay they don't want you know all of these all of us demand all the demand coming up one time but if you kept pal averting in fact I I Would say\nThat a candidate should uh goes through the process of qualifying for clean election funds\nAre then gets their money uh depending upon the race you know it's twenty five thousand forty five thousand what whatever it is depending upon the race and then when the races over\nIf if they've lost say they have to do something with their unused funds and instead of requiring the candidate to return the unused funds to the state there was a provision that they could give it to their their favorite political party\nSo there are political parties out there we wonder who they might have been that ah that would run a a whole slew of candidates\nQualify them for clean election funds those candidates within losing the primary uh and then they'd give their money to the Democratic party\nAnd this is happening right here in twenty Eighteen in this election and in in the prior campaigns as well and twenty sixteen and twenty fourteen right exactly so this was stopped at ... ... and it's an abusive and of course you know frankly clean elections was one of the stupid things\nThat Republicans a fought for along with you know McCain fined gold and some of the other unconstitutional things have limit\nA free speech clean elections a as a commission\nIs almost on accountable to anybody with respect to how they run it and and this is something that I think needs to be a yes vote and would you know we're an absolutely and and the ... years yes on this was All right\nSo let's let's go I Want to talk about um [noise]\nWe're talking about the city propositions first\nAh and then we'll go to county and we'll be quick about this city propositions one is to correct term it shouldn't be the election cycles so that um [noise] our city elections will be income four minutes with the with the state elections on an even years\nRight and that's for a weight that that ... and it it like you said a lines are city elections with state elections\nOr in a push them on the even year cycle and so the odd yes that's a yes right and and it also extends a they exist in terms of of current or how it was a practical matter what you have if you have to do it to get on this cycle\nAnd of course for some people say don't extend those gas terms for any reason but you got to do it but you have to do that you're going to have to do it to get it on the cycle and and that's a yes like I lost one that I write\nFor oh seven it's also a city or a proposition with respect to parks and recreation improvements\nYeah and ah parks and green ways and connections are and in our our our group the payment GOP\nUh and and our our our group the Pima GOP executive committee looked at this one pretty carefully there were some people on the committee that were quite familiar with it and we're uncomfortable uh with uh the way the city or\nCould handle money and do maybe what they wanted to do versus what people were expecting this to do so we came out with the no on this one right I think\nWell well founded to know on on a top a four oh sell seven um we got about two minutes for sixty three this is the county um bonds I'm\nI'm a now on four sixty three I'm my feeling is uh they just respect us ah and and this is not something that we want to ah to to uh give the county more power to to to do these roads and and to do all the things is that they want to do your your opinion\nWell the ... the county or took on a no position on this so and ...\nUh and this one is is one that has caused a quite a bit of a reaction from some quarters or two are taking a an uh an abstention on this one and and basically what we had done in our committee meeting was we went into the whole process\nWe went into the whole process with an agreement that if we if we couldn't agree a hundred percent on any of these propositions we would take no position\nBecause in the county committee to go out and say this is the committee's\nA position we wanted it to be unanimous or and on for sixty three uh we were not unanimous and uh I felt quite strongly and I've I'm In in the record book on this uh we've been in the ... ah I've written a position paper on it is out there in the public\nI felt very strongly that are two top\nCounty officials who deal with this who will deal with this issue\nA alley Miller and Steve crusty are on opposite ends on this for on this proposition\nA one of the yes and one reason though and this is a proposition involving the board of supervisors and the county and there are top elected officials in this county we have no higher officials in the Republican Party then are to be o s a super are two supervisors\nAnd so uh I feel very strongly that the county could not take a position\nThat would be in opposition\nTo one of our
