run against him\nYou're running against somebody even goofy here and crazier and left than than than him and that's a Victoria Steele [noise]\nThat's just credible that has grown more All right so real quick I I Want to get to the economy just a moment I Want to continue just real quickly uh from our last track and that was\nTalking about the uh other state employees who in the rush to to get a response to this whole red red thing\nThey got left behind and that is president workers and and state troopers and and all kinds of different people that work within the state and deal tea and and in various uh divisions all through the state they got nothing\nAnd and and the legislature needs to probably be looking at that as well\nWell I think employment needs to be equitable if you're a state employee we have to take a look at it read for ed did something very good maybe parochial for the teachers but we need to look at all the state employees that's important\nYeah and I I Know are we talked in in the break a teacher violence is is it pretty critical thing here in Arizona and elsewhere a teacher's not having control of the classrooms anymore a as a member of the state legislature this is something I guess you would support is bringing classroom control back to teachers\nDisciplined and and making sure that children are getting a chance to be educated yeah specifically\nWith us today I think things got out of control at the past uh administration in terms of discipline um I have relatives that are teachers I have in laws that are teachers want which is the principal got run over twice by angry parents about\nVarious things out of control parents my sister was beat up by a student\nUm she's been in physical therapy since last year or the school district where she teaches us is not in southern Arizona was more concerned about any sort of legal repercussions that I worry about my sister's house\nBut at the end of the day she told me you know I I could with her because she could have gone the coalmining had had better health than going into teaching but she loves to teach kids how to read that she loves to do that turns her on it's a very noble thing\nSo I mean I I I we need to protect our teachers they need to have some support to us is actually done some good things in terms of security measures one door entry locked and guarded that sort of thing but that's a very important thing you can't teach kids at there's no control in the classroom\nSo education maybe the you know the number one priority over the past a session a the economy is a huge thing we need to continue growing the economy here in Arizona Pima County doesn't get much from the state legislature from from the state government because we had no representation they're\nElecting you in on a Henderson that gives us a place at the table and and what would you do when you're elected your first Ninety Days on the job you're going to be faced immediately with with a new budget and all the things that come along with it what are your priorities on the economy to help build our economy\nWell in terms of background um I I've worked for a large corporations I\nUnderstand what that's environments like I understand what it's like to try to attract new people into a company that they come to Tucson they look around they read the newspaper and pick up information on the school district on the local economy and a lot of talented people have decided you know thanks but no thanks I'll go back to Minnesota and shovel my driveway because they see dysfunction\nSo we we desperately need to address the economy Tucson has the fifth poorest economy in the United states of America there's no reason for it since the great recession\nPhoenix is\nDouble our economic growth there is no reason for that either so we can attract businesses and we can do things to restore\nThe capability for small businesses because small businesses the engine that really drives the economy uh that's really what's going to make a difference in the local economy there's things that we can do to drive that instead of what Tucson typically is known for which is being a small business prohibit her\nSo your ... in addition to working IBM you also owned a small business and insurance agency here in such an armed with your wife um\nUh the economy needed role I mean that's a big thing to your family as well as your friends um what what can the state legislature do what can your participation do to change and an\nInfluence our economy here in Tucson ... let me pick up first and what you said about you know according to your family my kids are in New York\nBecause they didn't want to live in my basement and worked for minimum wage for that to get out of Tucson I get out of southern Arizona to get a legitimate job with let them at the gym at paying job which is sad things in my community that's my family I'd rather have them here in Tucson not necessarily my basement [laughter]\nBut here in Tucson so I can see 'em a little bit more often not have to get on a plane look there's a lot that the state can do to attract large businesses for example and I think if we had better packaging of capability the we're we're competing against forty nine other states to attract businesses to come here are some good things have happened without Amazon coming here we got\nUh some momentum with caterpillar but we need to provide incentives for these companies that come just like in the mid west or as a feeding frenzy among the Japanese automobile companies to come here\nThey're making it a an investment in us to come here we need to invest in them to come here and that can draw business to Arizona and if you take a look at the congestion the traffic all that is involved road and infrastructure\nIs a big deal and we literally haven't had anybody who actually is on the right side of the budget that gets passed in Arizona in several years in in ...\nA not for twelve years and and the state Senate and are all day right so it's a ... and there are a lot of orange comes up right now but I'm sure that will disappear certainly after November sex [noise] but yeah there's there's a lot of issues with infrastructure I\nMentioned that you take people you're driving down speedway they see more boarded up buildings and you see in downtown Baghdad rent and all the same way again it's like what's going\nOn that's all your district I mean that area long you know in in that kind of the north central and kind of the the near northwest neighborhoods ... I I'm I'm I'm a constituent myself living at Fort loan swan yes you are so it's\nEast to west hugs the mountains and goes all the way the foothills and goes all the way down the speed way and it's a good cross section of Tucson\nYeah you're different sounding candidate than a lot of Republicans and I think you bring that business background but in a different way uh I I think kind of your maybe your engineering brain or helps you kind of\nWhat did you do kind of give us a thumbnail sketch of what you did when you would work for the federal government\nUh I spent eight and a half years with the department of defense working in supplying logistics counter narcotics funding a working for the joint chiefs of staff are supporting airlifted see left thinking extra funding that sort of thing\nI actually uh my last assignment when I left the D O D I was working as the director financial management for\nA missile defense agency so Raytheon plays a big part in that\nOut from there and went over to ... ran their budget it was a worldwide budget and had all the staffing a that supported our worldwide operation\nConsidering I I don't wanna stop your your whole but considering your background and your professional back right I'm thinking you did for thirty one years\nThe number one job of a member of the years in the legislature is what to pass a budget to pass a budget um I was you been doing\nThat is what I've been doing I've worked budget that well maybe not every program is different they're all kinds of things I worked on Capitol Hill for the architect of the capital and then I went over my last budget that I managed was just a department of state budget\nUnder constantly surprised it was a give or take twelve plus billion dollars and it was a worldwide operation and two hundred and fifty locations my last job or Iran and immigration application processing center of about twelve hundred people in Lincoln, Nebraska but the point of it is is passing the budget is is key\nUm I have here in front of me and you can see a dog eared the pages and everything I've taken our twenty Nineteen budget and really taking a hard look at where our money's\nA or where they're scheduled to go this is the way the state legislature is talking about but do they actually get where they're going do they meet the purpose for which they are appropriated and the intent\nBut the key thing is what are we getting as results if we put X number of dollars towards a particular thing does the money actually go there and if it does what are we getting if it's good let's continue to fund it if it's bad\nMaybe we need to really look at it and put those scarce resources against some other program that is performing well\nAnd looking at our education system everybody says we got to fund Education Fund education and I agree with that\nBut let's take a hard look at where our resources are now and where they're going and eliminate waste and let it go through um I was reading the Goldwater Institute report on or if you've had a chance to see it and talks about education and it's like maybe we have money for the teachers' salaries if we can eliminate the waste\nAnd waste isn't administrative transportation some of our foods\nAnd the waste isn't it ministry of transportation center of our foods the service and and in the school\nAnd and that and that's a huge issue here the mechanic particularly with ... which is part of your legislative district correct correct so um\nYou actually have skills that allow you day one\nTo hit the ground running I mean this is not an on the job learning process um you actually have skills that allow you to be a participant\nAnd and mainly as a voice for Pima County 'cause we don't have much of a voice when it comes to the budget\nRight and we once did when when there was different a legislative proportionate but since you know since twenty eleven uh those those positions have now fallen out into coaches county and in other places we don't have nearly the representation in our leaders were there are leading for us\nCorrect and you know just and just because I had the budget experience that's all well and good I'm assistance thinker or you were talking about at just a moment ago Randy's engineering right I'm I'm a ... inch natural quality what exam and so I I I think\nFrom a systems viewpoint if any if you have a change in one thing it may have a corresponding change in another and you need to look at it holistically\nUm I've done a lot of work with strategic planning and the key thing is I've looked at our strategic plans for the state and I'm going I there's\n... it's pretty so what are we getting for that are we do we have performance metrics to say\nFor you know we're going to fund public safety or education or whatever um a goal that we have do we have a plan complete with action items and performance metrics to say and I hate to use the word I get the better bang for buck but it as we got to get a better bang for buck\nSo I'm going to make some assumptions sure you're strong woman\nYes you must drive the Democrats crazy because you stand for women's rights but you're pro life amendment I'm pro abortion forty a pro border security supporting\nA conservative Republican agenda and you're a female that must just drives me nuts\n[noise] maybe so but the thing of is like the one I did it's what I Do it's what I've been doing in public service for the last thirty one actually thirty eight years because I continue to do those things I'm a small business owner and I continue to work with our federal agencies in that regard\nIt's supposed to talk of will do that right after the break we'll come back here to second for talk of Maryland while she was a candidate she's the nominee of the Republican nominee for state Senate\nLD tent we'll be right back\nAs you don't advertise restaurants where I eat recommend services my family and I use ourselves our money your shoes are handled by
