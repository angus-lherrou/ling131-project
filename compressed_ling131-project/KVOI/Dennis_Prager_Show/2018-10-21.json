voiced announcer says is dedicated the notion that government forever remains servant master\nTo that and I had been requested on several occasions to go through the ballot propositions and I know this may not be sent to leading radio\nBut it is necessary radio\nBecause I don't think there are any other in depth long or any other I'm a long format radio programs that are actually going through all the ballots de Simone did a fairly decent job in the morning running through them quickly\nAnd a couple of days ago but at the same by the same token I Want to go into some depth and explain it I'm going to read\nSame token I Want to go into some depth and explain it I'm going to read not the entire proposition because I don't think I could get to them in an hour with the brakes number one and number two it's really boring to read proposition language I'm gonna try and give you the synopsis in some cases in most cases will be the legislative synopsis of at\nFirst I Want to explain the numbering system on ballots and I'm currently looking at the Arizona secretary of state's pamphlet a guide to Arizona proposition this explains the numbering pretty concisely of how ballot measures are numbered if it's a one hundred series proposition on the ballot\nThat is reserved him one hundred series is for constitutional amendments whether they're initiated by the people are referred by the legislature we have three two forms we have initiative in referendum\nInitiative is the method by which voters can propose new laws were amend existing laws by gathering signatures from registered voters to to place an issue on the ballot and there's rules about that\nA referendum is where the legislature well that's what a one hundred series\nWith one hundred series is a two hundred series proposition is a citizen initiative to create a new law or amend current laws either by initiative or referendum referendum in contrast\nIs the method by which the voters can veto a law or part of a law or or even um enact a law where the legislatures says you know\nWe don't want to act on this we feel this is important enough to refer to the people\nSo we're going to write proposed legislation and then ran for that to the electorate that's called the referendum that's the difference between initiative and referendum and the initiative is where the people themselves foreman organization and go out and gather in ... and gather signatures they have to do it right there is a lot of very specific rules\nBut they can get something on the ballot\nReferendum is where the legislature believes that something is so important that the people should vote on it not them so that's the difference between initiative in referendum back to ... the explanation of the numbers a three hundred series\nProposition on a ballot is the legislative referrals to create new laws were men current laws statutes and are numbered in the three hundred and four hundred series is a local ballot measure and those are numbered in the for hundreds\nSo that explains the if it's a one hundred it's a constitutional amendment ... two hundred it's a citizen initiative if it's a three hundred it's a legislative referral and if it's a four hundred series of proposition it's a local issue so that should give you a little bit of clarity in framing\nWe're going to look at a prop one twenty five and let me see if we find the explanation unplug a prop one twenty five prop one twenty five is a requesting proposing an amendment to the constitution of the\n... the state of Arizona article twenty four section one constitution relating to public retirement systems prop one twenty five is allows the state to adjust\nFor a cost was cost of living increases for retirement pensions were legislators and people in the corrections system\nCurrently they have what's called fixed benefits and what's happening is right now and you're seeing this not just in Arizona but all over the country where the fixed benefit packages are are agreed to in boom times for the state\nAnd then when a state has less collections or falls upon hard times the the compensation for the people who are retired are fixed\nEnded obligates the state it basically bankruptcy state and what this allows the state to do is provide cost of living called Cola's cost of living adjustments to retirement pensions and make them equal what's going on in the economy so that it doesn't bankrupt the state\nYou never want to give government funding source for anything because it it will expand and it will run away that it it's\n... it's like taking the governor office rod all the engine will run away if there's a reason there's a governor on a throttle there's a reason there's a governor on the speed of of certain vehicles and you need to have a break\nOn government so that it can't just start subsumed in everything in its path economically speaking that's why I'm In favor of one twenty six okay let me think it's a reasonable position for a person to have\nTo be in favor of one twenty six [noise]\nAll right let's continue on one twenty seven is also a constitutional amendment amending article Fifteen of the constitution of Arizona to require electricity providers to generate at least fifty percent of their annual sales of electricity from renewable energy sources\nDo I have to read all the all all the all the reasons for and against is no no no\nDon't restrict any energy source don't restrict anything as soon as you begin restricting things if you know anything about supply and demand which is the basic rules of which is the the basic rule of economics supply and demand\nWhen you have supply and demand if ... if the demand exceeds the supply and the price is going to go up and what's gonna happen is Arizona's a growing state our needs for energy are growing if you restrict the supply you're going to drive the price through the roof\nCalifornia's prices are rising at three times the rates that Arizona that the rest of the nation is the because California is done exactly this if you want a laboratory of liberty California is your negative example Donald California Kate Arizona\nNo no no on one twenty seven if you don't vote for anything else\nAnything else on your ballot if you don't even vote for a candidate which I Hope you will\nBut if you if you don't vote for anything else vote against vote no on one twenty seven it's eight terrible idea it and you know it's going to affect it's really going to affect people on a fixed income because if you read one twenty seven I don't have time to read the whole thing it's very long and it it it's rather a long and in involved it's\nIt runs the actual ballot proposition itself runs\nFor five for five and a half pages long and I couldn't possibly read it\nBut what it says is is that the supply of all of a vote of power will be this'll be applied regardless of the effect on the rate or the consumer\nWell you can't leave the consumer out of the picture of the whole idea\nAnd got the the purpose of government is to protect the rights the individual citizen what this actually does is it violates protection aid violates article to section to the constitution not that I suspect a whole bunch of judges or a whole bunch of legislators even know what the state of purpose of government is\nOr or will be or we'll have feel to it but the point of the matter is one twenty seven is a poisonous amendment vote no make it go down in flames\nRight one twenty seven or you look at who's a a for it and who's against it we don't have time let's go onto the next one one twenty seven has a solid no\nScroll through an scrolling through the ballot prop I downloaded it into my thumb drive\nAnd so I'm reading it off of there I've got the entire secretary of state's pamphlet here and I'm only picking out the things that are that are relevant or timely for an hour on the radio when you take out the ... the twelve minutes or so for the brakes\nLet's see in the open and the closer the show oh let's see scrolling through still on one twenty seven there's a whole bunch of storm on drying up people who are for it and people who are against it and it's just that\nIt's just a hit parade of of the usual suspects for and against one twenty seven but I'm going to let a scroll through that if you go to ... a question you can call in and asking at five to zero seven nine zero two zero four zero off the air somebody asked about the idea\nIdea of conflicting the pensions of legislators retired legislators with the pensions of people in law enforcement and fire fighting\nIt needs to cover all those people because the entire pension system needs to be from the state needs to be looked at in terms of uh of funding that's why it's done that way\nIf anyone else had a question on and on one twenty six if I wasn't clear on one twenty six let's go back up to one twenty six\nI went too far\nOne twenty six was uh that uh I I was for protecting I was for protecting the or the taxpayers against new taxes on one twenty six one twenty seven is a definite definite no and let me scroll through here there's no faster way to\nDo this yes there is there is a fast way to do this\nOn twenty seven twenty seven sorry for the deterring on the radio but this has to be done accurately in order\nFor the didn't ring on the radio but this has to be done accurately in order to cover all the important ones and let's see one twenty seven\nStandby on AM ten thirty ... view I live in local and we will be I'll tell you what we're going to be right with you [noise]\nOr later on mine and I tend to lower that's it that's the right one okay\nAnd the next one is propositions Rio five proposition thrill five\nPreserves what's called empowerment scholarships and it what it does is it preserves the ability of people who are uh to to send their school or their children in school they wish rather than forcing them\nForcing the money to only go to the schools this would force the money to follow the children and it's a really good idea arguments for proposition three o five this is from um\nThe bishops of the Arizona Catholic conference in Phoenix\nArizona children or perhaps the most important natural resource we have it is therefore appropriate to families and communities make a tremendous sacrifice so that our children are able to achieve their maximum potential\nWe all want our children to succeed and agreed that providing quality educations are absolute are absolutely essential toward this and that is important to recognize that kids are different are different and what works for one child may not\nWork for another and liberty watch your first name please Marty Marty around here\n[noise] hey ah I don't know if you uh that that one about uh uh the energy ... they got the word mandate in there and I don't we don't want mandated a\nYou know I I'm not opposed to other forms of energy but when they say mandate man your time is right down to a you know\n... and if some other excellent source like for instance let me give me an example if someone were to come up with a story um reactor\nOr something like that where story of might not be considered a renewable resource or if someone could master cold fusion and produce electricity from it\nAnd it's not considered a natural resource even if it's a great idea you couldn't do it because the mandate would prohibited it would have to be either it it would have to be basically solar or wind\nWhat what you you don't want to tell people to vote for that thing because of course you know you're you're ... oh okay I thought I I miss I miss read\nYou know one twenty seven is poison one seven is would mandate that we only use a ... or that fifty percent of the energy come from a new ... maybe I'm going to ...\nBecause I I understood you to say uh you know to vote for it I saw the man's crazy\nOne twenty six one twenty six is I think the one I was talking about not one twenty seven one day one twenty seven is is is poison\nI'm not opposed to renewable energy tell people you have to have it that's crazy that's nonsense\nRight exactly yeah and I'm not opposed to it either frankly\nThat you know if I had a spare thirty grand I Would I Would solar power my house and just tell you Peter go pound sand I Would just put my cell phone battery and disconnect from the grid and go you know you you all go have a nice day and and don't ever bother me again\nBut you know Charles all this energy stuff is really getting crazy we got to start balancing this out you can't go one way or the other way and and we're going to release gr ourselves up\nWhat do you mean balance well I don't understand we all like\nFor example electric cars and gasoline powered cars it's going to like drink\nA eventually but you know we rely on gas taxes and what not to provide other uh needs for automobiles and so forth right textiles and everything else and they go too far one way we're going to get ourselves all out of whack here\nPresident elect Arizona PTA Phoenix\nArizona PTA has spoken for every child with one voice for a hundred and twelve

are meant for public schools not fund that not funneled to schools that are not transparent or held accountable to anyone to allow people who can well afford private education\nFrom paying their fair share most of these schools don't have to accept students with special needs and discriminate against ... students based on race creed or sexual orientation and more\nFinally there is no proof that a private education is better than a public school because there is no accountability or ... and no transparency to prove that statement one way or the other to the phones and liberty watched you're on

what they did is they use one of the ... continue rails\nTo mount a rack that had a a spin on it and then on the role of toilet paper on it I don't I'm sure it wasn't originally engineered that way but they were trying to either they were making fun of themselves and all of us\nWhich is okay with me I I don't mind if people joke about stuff like that number one and number two is is that they

I'm not criticizing you I Know you build guns and you have a division that works for law enforcement and you make guns that aren't available to the ... unfortunately to the civilian market\nI get that but what we're dealing with people in this audience who mostly aren't on an NPR team\nYou know sure it was getting that though is that if you if you've noticed that they choose shorter guns for certain levels rise didn't make more sense so for civilian use it\nIf you're looking for a home defense type of rifle or a home defense type weapon um those for her air fifteens make a lot of sense for a for home defense to make a lot of sense for a place like you know a to point out of a vehicle\nUm there's all there's a reason why those guns are using in fact they're such more easily accessible to civilians now has is what has caused that popularity to explode\nSet up by a relative or a a good\nFriend of mine has a Lamborghini on I was I was not familiar with the a trunk space civil Lamborghini until he showed me which is about big enough to fit a twelve pack you know if there's not a lot of room there but he wanted a gun that would fit in that compartment\nUm and he won in ...\nWe were working with extremely limited space but because of the walls with the schools and in that we were able to achieve that we've built much three hundred blackout suppressed Pistole the folding stock or if I should say a folding buffer tube that fit in that compartment\nAnd a ... who are projects\nDid you take pictures of it oh man there's a video on Facebook a Scott like a million and a half years or something it was yeah we took a ton of pitchers\nMhm you call that won the Feinstein [laughter]\nJust for two weeks value alright stand by and we have colors Sean that wants to ask you a question Sean go ahead\nI got to ask I got to know a couple of ... why did you have your company started delivery\nYes that is a great question Mike\n[noise] well I wanted the company to represent a I I wanted I wanted to get our our our mission statement out front and if he was historically look at the sons of liberty\nOr they're obviously the founders of the country right and it's been Franklin and Thomas Paine Sam adams in\n... the values of our founders be\nThe constitution B B the freedoms that this idea that they created that called America I thought was so important the profound especially if you look at the time in which we started our company\nSo we started our company we were in probably one of the worst of battles over the to wait in recent history I mean this was after um\nThe Sandy Hook situation [noise] um and you know that that that attitude I think we wanted to draw a hard line\nIn let people be meeting we know where we still have that um and I've never been in the business of appeasement I Know that the other side is never going to like me so I spend exactly zero effort trying to appease them I was all in for our side my sons of liberty was the was the appropriate name\nAmen Sean do you have a\nFollow up on yeah Kenneth Lay down can I get ...\n... I'm like well in answer to your question Sean [noise] [laughter]\nThey have to you out there Mike I've got one more it's an easy I think on this program go ahead go for John you got\nOne more thing is uh where are you located at a were based in San Antonio\nTexas but you know we have ... and we should all as a country but San Antonio Texas was all\n... San Antonio that's kind of not real friendly to that area is not necessarily very friendly to your to your topic is it\nYou know oddly enough a San Antonio has ... is becoming less friendly there's actually yeah ... ... a ordinances on the\nOn the agenda backs it directly affect our business to talking about changing the zoning laws uh for where guns can be sold was talking about adding a different city and county taxes to people that sell the gun\nAnd this is in Texas and people cannot take for granted oh hey\nIt's Texas or oh hey it's Arizona we're safe that doesn't necessarily mean right ... is almost as competitive here if that tells you anything\nThey can I can I ask you might have have they heard of this thing called the Alamo\n[laughter] you know there's a ... I I notice a little bit\nBut there's actually a motion right now for the Texas board of education where they want to remove the ...\nFrom the description of the defenders of the Alamo as they say that that implies works you know this isn't Texas and we're talking about the Alamo so that gives you any indication of how wacky things are getting you know that that's a wake up call I Hope everybody every person that poll it might remember\nI I understand there are also working on a a proposition to a ... to redefine ocean is not having anything to do with water All right Sean ... one last follow up\nLast night and tell the audience I'll take it on the air if you were building a small I called the asphalt or car being based a are would you rather do like a pistol caliber car being or you like\nA big book outliers all white on the air Mike and and God Bless you Matt Weiner much you got blessed by state might rise\nWhy does the steel my questions [laughter] it's okay All right Charles no hey accidently he actually\nHas very very good ideas he has the show following this one and you should listen to it it's excellent um brush fires of freedom so All right appreciate it Shawn andme and let you go and Mike go ahead and take on Charles question if you had before the break\nUp there is a rising popularity ... caliber carbons right now and I think a perhaps in in certain applications they might have a good role I personally\nPrefer the five five six caliber I prefer a rifle cartridge or in a rifle than you and you we actually see that um we actually seen a lot of the traits we do for different agencies and stuff were swapping them a rifles and they're giving us back in return him in the fives are kind of phasing out some of those ...\nIf I made the the MP five is a heckler and coke machine gun and it is in night mostly it's in nine millimeter go ahead\n... white and so we're seeing a lot of those being phased out of ... for a more effective rifle a rifle caliber weapons so that is still a still miss the size and Lincoln requirements about a rifle cartridges generally when to over perform official cartridge every time I mean that is just the fact of it\nExcept if it's maybe a five hundred Smith Wesson or a four or five fifty or for fifty Bush master or what's the one they have in California this California legal I'm trying to think of the the Caribbean or using in California that so\nBut well time being the amount of time the bullet holes in the barrel right\nThe amount of time the borders and the barrel beyond the gas port oh so the distance from the gal sports or the muzzle that is ...\n... ... how far down the muzzle is the gas pork but his audience the gas part is the place where the gas comes out of the rifle and a comes out of the barrel and goes backwards towards the boat to make the gun function go ahead go ahead my ...\n[noise] so I mean that's going to be taught me it's going to start getting closer to the muzzle closer to the point is to the muzzle the less dwell time you have this you'll ... borders sealing the barrel\nForcing that gas up the two\nIn back down to the carrier key which is kind of like your power that is the that is the ... that's driving up ... rear end so the longer that you have this you'll more well time you have typically more forgiving\nThe gun is going to be another thing that's really overlooked in this industry is the relationship\nBetween a gasp port in the buffalo we so often that government you're talking about that you had I Would imagine that some of your problems could have been remedied\nHad ... years a heavier buffer 'cause I felt like I said sure guns are less forgiving you need to make sure that\nThe scale of late on a buffer to the to the audience if you would\nThe buffer weight is the part in the is overweight and and the offer to\nOld Kerry basically pushes against and that is kind of the engine was tribes have gotten us was controlling the motion of ... those are the care of your body and it's also the mass that Cindy ... back in the battery\nAnd if you start having really violent carriers each if you have no bashed a kind of slow it down moving forward\nA you start experiencing some real problems were that that\nThat will just traveling so fast that it's actually eating the magazine follower into position and not loading the round correctly from like the back of the rod is actually catching it kind of halfway up so you see a lot of ah you see a lot of weird bell functions like that um\nWhere is it malfunctions where the cartridge gets malformed going back into battery\nExactly if you start seeing your car if you start seeing the key things really deformed yep you have a massively overcast gun\nAnd that was the problem too bad I didn't know anybody that was sharp enough with the A R pattern at the time to figure out my problem I probably could have made that gun work but the seats they took it solve the problem for me in a way that guns miss just wouldn't\nKnow hopefully uh hopefully he you know hopefully a failed on about the worst possible how high hopes\nI Hope it failed on I'm always threatening to law enforcement officer with it and they and they feel them falls that'd be good that'd be a good result\nYou oddly enough when we see weapons malfunction it's usually at the worst opportune time I
