amazing every college there was an office of diversity it's the the the left wing takeover of the universities total office of diversity on campus and gauge with\nSarah Lawrence college right teach the email was soliciting ideas from Sarah Lawrence community or look even he's bought into this community for a conference open\nEven he's pulled into this community for a conference open to all of us

columnist or and an editor a contributing editor to the Tucson sentinels\nThat is correct and before that I was a um political writer for the Tucson Citizen rest in peace\nAddressed in Tucson Citizen I miss an afternoon news paper really do I uh it's a shame I Wish our market could have supported a two newspapers but to me too [laughter]\nI'm Blake ... is a ... we have are in an incredible time for politics um I think that in the age of Trump there are no there's nothing that should be surprising\nUm did you see the debate between Christ in cinema and a curse and send them excuse me and uh uh uh Martha McSally\nA couple of times yeah I had to watch it once and then had to go back and get quotes for a column that I wrote about it so yeah I I watched it and it was funny because the first time I watch it I thought wow I'm Sally looked really strong a cinema looked kind of robotic\nBut the second time I watched it I kind of sauce cinema really being controlled discipline smoothly and taking the fight to mix Sally who was um a really you\nDescribed ... gun in the end when she went in with she went in with all\nGuns blazing and she was clearly um uh and then she was clearly frustrated with ... or um or or the ... kind of ... cinemas demeanor seemed to mug a bug mix Sally [noise] so what we ... we were just saying Jim was that\nIf you listen to it on the radio I can see people thinking you know what I think cinema one that she can kind of control the flow of the debate she was really disciplined\nBut if you saw it on television um I think ... humanity kinda came across that exasperation that just ... ... she was more ... in in some ways I think that but\nI've noted for a while and and I got to tell you I think she's ... she's very authentic that had her communication that was absolutely a whole lot back no and and I think what what you hear from her is what you get I've never seen her flip flop never seen her deviate\nFrom what she has said previously\nAnd she will explain above she will look even if it's even if it's if it's an explanation that then maybe the base doesn't like or or somebody on the other side doesn't like she will at least explained her vote\nFor instance what was the big the big issue was about health care right about Martha so called flip flop on healthcare reality two different bills one that was going to go nowhere in the Senate yeah goes back to caucus tries to recruit another bill\nAt the second time that they went back to caucus the Democrats don't even want to show up caucus so\nAnd this will be ... libre doubt let's let's be clear about what happened Republicans decided to do that in the back room without inviting Democrats in and then they were and then they said this is your built take it or leave it they did\nBill but mass to show my name is Jim Kelly filling in for Bill while he is vacation enough in the northwest of of the United states um\nTo my right is my guest Blake\nMore lock and we've been talking politics I'm Blake was my opposite number I in this political a Cold War that we've been having for a for quite a few years\nIf you want to get on the conversation phone number is five to zero seven nine zero two zero four zero five to zero seven nine zero two zero four zero\nBlake I'm we talked about the cinema a mix Sally a debate let's talk about live Marquez Peterson an anchor Patrick what did you think of that debate\n[noise] um I I had to wake up a couple of times during a it was um I don't think it was that informative um but you know I that was sort of the\nI Would have liked to it I I I thought the format we can see where you can do you think you've got a a a a good field and just for who we are as and do you have a good deal adjusts for who an is based on that debate we we did with the cinema ... yeah I didn't I not not really I mean I kind of get we're\nUm ...\nYou know ... where are they both are is I Can't think were a lot of um a lot of candidates are now especially on the Republican side or the question is\nWhat is Trump is with the Republicans wondering what Trump means to me and the question is is this is Trump helping me is the hurting me for it and I don't know the Republicans are always able to answer that question based on frankly\nIt's especially long term you on TALK about certainly just uh\nWhat's the latest tweet what's the latest outrage\nPulled out of it a second Chuck Chuck is on the line Chuck how can we help you today\n[noise] Hi this is Kelly yeah I've got a question that local politics okay I heard that the borders supervisors last night passed a resolution in support of the\nParis climate whatever they call it a word yeah every three to to vote yes okay and they made arrangements\nTo set aside some money to support this and remodeling some buildings and to get some more open space and who knows what else I think it's nuts\n[laughter] well I'll tell you\nThat that's just crazy this is crazy\nI'm going to give you I'm going to give you my thoughts on this and then place going to give you his uh from the other side my thoughts on this are are are twofold one ... Pima County really doesn't have any business you know sitting down and say no we're going to go with the Paris climate accord that the United states has already pulled out\nBut on the other side of the coin is at Pima County wants to save money use renewable energies a redesign or re develop some ah some old old buildings that uh\nSome uh some old old buildings or that a deck and use solar or wind or or whatever it renewable way I have no problem with that\nUm but like I said when it comes down to is the foundation of the vote was about the Paris climate accord that the United states government isn't even a part of Pima County government does not negotiate a treaties with other\nCountries that's my thing and so it's none of their darned business but by this but the other side of the coin is\nIf they do something good for a for a our buildings and they do something good for upgrading our our abilities to renewable energy I've got no problem with that like what do you say are you sure\nChuck Huckleberry doesn't negotiate treaties and to have\nThese [laughter] I'm not I'm not sure he's\nNot part of the ... and uh yeah I look this is nothing new they basically it sounds like they would they basically did was slap Paris climate accord and stuff that they do anyway which is a judge to shout out to the ... yeah yeah which is yeah and and the Paris climate accord\nWere were largely voluntary anyway they were just you know this is what we agree to do um to to fight climate change so it wasn't anything and reserve the right to not do it um it was\nJust kind of a ... yeah so uh they ... they've done LEED green lead silver buildings which are very environmentally um or lead gr lead gold I think it was legal lead silver um they've been doing with Jim said designing\nEnvironmentally friendly buildings had been buying open space for\nGod to ... yeah I mean and I think\nThey just rebranded as as um as Paris climate accord but people can call and tell me I'm wrong\nSo does that answer your question Chuck\n... okay I live it's a let's get back to again\nFirst off ... obviously you're on the other side so you you think that you know the values of Arizona are uh are are being reflected in a cinematic Sally a campaign and you think cinema reflects but let's get back down to CD too which is a\nPurple as you're getting yeah OK Democrats have about two thousand voter registration to our excuse me and he's like three thousand voter registration advantage and CD to the Democrats are plus why cook right ... the really definitely hearty not designated to Pima County\nCan kind of sway that so basically what we're looking for is every Democrat would have to get out and vote for hacker Patrick Bracken back to the way if every Democrat voted never Republican voted and would win but because of the party not designated\nThose are the swing vote so what we're looking at is between four and five thousand votes that ad needs from the from the independence and the forty five thousand votes the Lee is going to need from the independents\nWho do you think is again taking a look at least a debate performance an anchor patches debate performance who do you think the independents are most likely to swing\nI think this is what exactly what our president wants to be it's gonna be a referendum on Donald Trump and I don't think I think it could be you and me we could substitute our names in there tomorrow at the same result um and so it was a fair answer as well I expect um\nI expect since the cinema I expect that actually makes Sally should have the advantage in you know statewide um I think at the ... I Would be ... I\nI Would add to the bride wrote that some mackerel I went yeah but but but I I well you can ride on in Congress and the two are to be surprised that I had to do with a lot to be very very different I I wouldn't be surprised if Kirkpatrick last just because\nBut do you think the people if you have a cat and and coaches county are sitting there saying what's Trump done for me do you think that was your question right know what's Trump done for me no well\nI think I I think it's all you do I feel about ... how do you feel how do I feel\nAbout Trump and I think it's debatable about whether or not um this economic up turn his is helping a broad swath\nOf ... uh you know mark hasn't Peterson was actually here in Tucson building businesses blog before Trump ever got here or ... or drop was prejudice is not a commentary\nOn an anchor Patrick's long term viability in that seat this is this year right now um I think people are going to vote to give to just put a check on Donald Trump um would\nVirtually no assist from the Democrats saying you need to put it to check on Donald Trump they had to wonder messaging has uh\nThey they know they don't get their message hasn't been an anti Trump message it hasn't been\nYou know Trump is trucks backed us bad they're messaging has been or just wanted to check out but wait a minute whether issues a bit like health care health care which is a Medicaid for all basically what the Democrats the progressive side as I Try to know Medicaid\nMedicare and Medicaid Medicare would become then in not just senior program but it's not the Medicaid\nIs access which is paid for a property taxes which is a completely different system um administered state wide than Medicare so let's be you know I can use the you can use the quotes around Medicaid but go ahead go ahead oh All right so I'll stand corrected on this at the moment um so Medicare\nFor all I that's number one okay Planned Parenthood roe be way that's number two yeah what's number three guns right yeah ... well I've got a I've got a few things I could give to the Democratic party all of a couple of secrets I could do\nIf the Democratic party for the next four years never said a word about guns it would break the in Iraq\nBecause nobody would donate to get out right\nEvery job that never lowered about guns for his heirs and their membership to the Democrat opens their mouth about guns Republicans go buy more animal [laughter] okay I could I I have a great record for that but you gotta I gotta agree things I as a a great a little\nI'm voting you anyways yeah first time at first ... first election I have that I have any say in the city council of Tucson or anything the city of Tucson for a long long time 'cause I've always lived outside of the county\nAnd you get to say and you're saying yeah and I and I got in ... and I'm saying yes to the city on this one I let me tell you I bet if you don't if Jim is in favor of it\nThan I'm all for the last one is the city charter change we're talking about changing the charter of the city of Tucson\nTo extend our city council and mare one year and so that they're all gonna run together now instead of separately is this my understanding of it yeah um and uh\nUh you know and and um and I've got no problem with this I think it's a step forward because eventually I I Want to get rid get down to ward only elections but well let me go to jail for\nFor a bunch of people who are scared of\nThe mob I'm having everybody exposed to single passions single election I have I have some problems with but on the other hand if you want to throw the bums out at once you can throw the bums out at once said it probably be of a flip a coin to me but um but I I\nI Will say that the chances of charter change are very very limited they every time a charter change proposition comes up almost always gets voted down doesn't a note in get some of the kids what was the last charter change to city it was if you remember\nAbout I'm a long time wasn't there was the one for a yeah I guess\nI didn't really close I Can't remember but you know what I think when they've always always get voted down there is a really good voter\nInstinct which is when you don't understand something they know say no right that is a great instinct because he was the very least you're doing no harm\nUm also I'd like to see if we can do charter changes let's do some real charging yeah actions yeah let's let's let's feeble balls here than where they are now so he's been a language\n[laughter] can say that on the radio is that All right okay ... ... and ... get away with a high\nA high so let's uh let's take a look at or some other local stuff um we've got some legislative district races going on we got Chris ... running down in a in a um a legislative district to literally rush for twenty second street in Tucson all the way to know gas\nAnd it's two to one he he actually made it one time he saw his way back what do you think uh Chris soccer league take you use it was a good legislator for the for the district when he was and he was a Republican but you know do you think he was you know got got some stuff
