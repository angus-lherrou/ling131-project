Institute is free speech litigation efforts\nBoy talk talk about a holy cause and [laughter] All right\nAnd before joining Goldwater he served nine years as the managing attorney of the Institute for justice is Texas office which he opened in two thousand eight\nThere you one important victories for free speech and economic liberty fire that he worked as a land use attorney and a large Dallas law firm is a joy in a pleasure to welcome to the microphones and telephones of liberty Watchmen Miller welcome sir\nI'm Sorry start over go ahead well thank you Charles for having me on I appreciate it's my pleasure I as I Love to tell\nThank you Charles for having me on I appreciate it's\nMy pleasure I'm I as I Love to tell them I guess I'm Glad you could be ad [laughter] this is you wrote a phenomenal article is it a law review article or it's a it's about what a ten ten page you know it's less than it is about four page article on the history of this where was that a law review article you wrote or where to disappear\nI Know that that was a paper that we put together for the Goldwater Institute oh celebrating the ... anniversary of N. double ACP the Alabama\nAnd that's a great place to start because I Want you to give people a background about this is about donor privacy about why it's important not to force\nOrganizations like the N. double ACP or the easy CDL or organization I started the activist Organisation I didn't start if I were three others I'm One of the four co founders of it\nStarted to uh for a self defense civil rights why is it important not to force those organizations to publish their donor lists\nWell it's important because um people whose names are disclosed to the government and get put on a list can be subjected to ideological harassment intimidation um we saw this back in the Nineteen fifties with the N. double ACP which was what eventually led to that landmark piece of litigation in double A. C. P. V. Alabama\nI'm In we didn't see it today where you have people encouraging ideologues to get in the face of their opponents you know to go to their homes to scream at them in restaurants um and so you know many donors who support organizations would rather remain private and donor privacy has been a cardinal virtue in this country for decades\nUm it is something that Supreme Court has recognized but it's under assault today\nYou might give us a little bit more background on me and double ACP versus Alabama case just sort of give us the maybe the meats and bounds of it so that people have or a context for them for the next half hour radio\nSure yeah so back in the Nineteen fifties um you know the N. double ACP was integral enforcing desegregation in southern states that didn't want to desegregate\nAnd so the attorneys general of the states and the governments of those states or tried to force those groups out using any means they could and and one thing they tried to do was forced the N. double ACP to disclose its member list to the government\nAnd of course that's incredibly dangerous because once the government knows who's supporting these groups and once they're ideological opponents know supporting these groups\nThey can target those people for harassment and for intimidation and that's exactly what they did the N. double ACP resisted these efforts they claim to First Amendment right to free speech free association and privacy and they eventually one before the Supreme Court which said that the state of Alabama could not force them\nTo disclose their member list to the government lists were provided were protected by the first amendment\nSometimes cases are pretty controversial what was the what was the the the the justice count on the N. double ACP N. double ACP case where\nIt was unanimous really the unanimous verdict was I mean the court recognize what was going on you know what what what the government said was well we need we need to know belongs to these groups 'cause we have to figure out whether or not they're subject to our corporation laws in our state\nWhich which was clearly protection and it will end up ... ... feet said look we will stipulate that were subject to your incorporation laws that will do whatever you need to do as far as registry in our group like you know we're here we're replace of businesses\nBut you don't need to remember lists and the government continued to go after them continue to threaten them with sanctions and they had to go all the way up to the U.S Supreme Court to protect that that right to association under the first amendment\nEnded Alabama eventually uh obey the Supreme Court stick to them or did they ... tried to pull a Carl Colorado and ignore it\n[laughter] well they did eventually of it um it actually took one more trip to the court that was not as much of a landmark case um but it did take one more trip to the court to finally forced to stay to a bad um and they weren't able to get those member list and that has stood a landmark decision for sixty years um this year [laughter]\nUm Citizens United a game and it's just desserts\nSure um well Citizens United on had to do with whether or not people could come together and pull their money um and and engaging speech about politicians\nSo so McCain Feingold had tried to prevent that they tried to prevent you and me and and Joe down the street from coming together forming a group and then putting out political ads about politician supporting them or or you know obviously encouraging people to oppose them um Citizens United had made a video about Hillary Clinton\nAnd that that essentially encourage people not to vote for Clinton and it was about history or past time it was a fairly long movie um and that ran afoul of McCain Feingold\nAnd so they went to the court and they said look if you have the right\nTo come together form these groups and speak about politicians and give you know you know and pull our money and talk to people about political issues and what the court said was yes when people come together in an association that can be a corporation that can be some other kind of group you have the right to form action committee and now they're called political action committees\nAnd talk to people about politicians and about politics\nAnd and the government can't come and prevent you from doing that\nEven if a person in this is a little off the topic but it's a long it's done the same road and it's something that that that you'll be able to answer man and that is even if a person is not an attorney doesn't have a law degree or never taken a class in well\nHow is it possible that they could read the first amendment let alone be sworn to uphold it as we're Russ Feingold in the late in the late John McCain how could people who are sworn to uphold that have read the first amendment and then written that legislation\nYou know I don't know um you know you know whenever people talked about this issue there was talk about money in politics but this is it a speech in politics and and people always have the right to come together and speak\nUm but by the government you know where he rejected that and the Citizens United case in fact you know it at oral argument um that the court asked the attorney for the government so does this give you the right to censor a book that somebody wrote about Hillary Clinton and they said under this law we would have the right to censor that book\nWhich is just remarkable you know the government and claim a right\nTo censor a book that's fundamental first minute speech under a campaign finance law\nI Love your restraint I I respect your restraint but I don't love it\n[laughter] when you say it's remarkable I think it's appalling it's ... it's it's it's it's it's denigrate the entire not just the words the language of the first amendment but the whole idea behind it\nW T F what's the fun I mean how could how in the world could any right thinking person ever writes such a ... asking I'm really hating the issue with don't speak how do they do that\n[noise] it it because they become obsessed with this idea that that people are spending money talking about politics and you know [noise] that that that happens every year I mean Americans still spend less money if you're talking about politics than I Do buy an Halloween candy I mean it's not actually that much money they get spending a year\nYou know politicians politicians will not do\nThat especially elected politicians they see these laws that as an incumbent protection laws and once they're there they don't like people come in and say mean things about them and so they use campaign finance as a way to reduce the number of mean things people can say about politicians\nWell I just got to tell you that if Goldwater ever doesn't work out you got a guaranteed spot in the Halloween Halloween candy lobby\n[laughter] it's a fun to just take I thought it was topical\nUm and I think it really puts it in perspective you know yes there is you get people spend money on on campaign ads and yes we all get tired of seeing them around this time of year but but it's fundamental speech this is how we communicate with each other on how we talk about politics and the first minute gives you an absolute right to do it\nI respectfully and lovingly disagree with you I don't think the first ... gives you are right I think that guarantees the right you already have that's fair\nYeah All right to the phones and Greg Greg wants to ask you a question Greg Iran with Matt Miller of the Goldwater Institute your comment or question for him\nYou bet chosen matinee a good to meet you this way you know Charles was mentioning practicing law without a license\nAnd was\nPart of the new rich that a little earlier about somebody with speech freedom of speech\nNo I said when you have a law degree or you don't how can anybody who sworn to ... to ... to uphold a uh uh the constitution ... look at the first amendment and read such a law\nOkay well I misspoke Charles but the point that I'm making is is that the state of Arizona in conjunction with the Supreme Court they have rules and one of the rules is that I because I'm not an attorney\nAnd not allowed to advise others of their constitutional rights and as you know Charles I've been doing that for Twenty years so that it's not the only state the union where would I Do is not a crime it's just a violation of a rule but God Bless her\n... a superior court judge here met in the ... county\nWhen the state board sued me in those seven and brought up all the people I've helped the three things I filed\nOr what's your question for him actually this is the common face\nOh you what's your question for him\nActually this is the common fish do you have another caller old and I was just going to ask him if he agreed with me\nThat when judge Bernie ruled in those seven that I was not in violation of any rule and she dismissed their case wouldn't future judges be collateral you stopped from them to stay pursuing me again\nOkay Matt that's a great question I think I Know the answer but Matt you're the attorney you guide\nSure um well I have to say I'm going to be looked at the lawyer Li preference which is that I'm not familiar with that particular taste but\nUm you know if a state bar chose to see you again it would have to be on a new set of facts they couldn't just see you under the old set of facts\nUm and and yes you know as to that court they I think they would have needed to appeal that decision and therefore try to win on appeal or respect to the district judges decision I'm not come in and go after you again and again trying to use the same set of facts to bring the same set of claims that was stopped in most cases\nOkay and that's it exactly chose a the the critical feels that decision\nRight and I didn't they didn't want to thank you\nFor your welcome and appreciate it nothing like free legal advice on Sunday after what neighboring All right in the as we bring this to a close 'cause we're coming to the bottom of the hour here\n... I Want to ask you is this question because there's there's a central issue ... the people who are not in favor of donor privacy\nWill say that money is not speech money is money and speech speech which is which or are they both\nWell um we have to spend money in order to talk um you know whether it's find a political ad whether it is you know having having an Internet connection allows me to communicate over the Internet whether it's having a phone that allows me to to call in to your show a money isn't necessary component of speech unless I just want to go and stand on the street corner\nSo so that the first amendment protects our right to spend money in order to speak\nAnd so you know what the court said is is that money is the equivalent of speech when you're using money to speak and therefore that's protected on the first amendment\nWell it's like the second amendment doesn't say the right to keep and bear ammunition shall not be infringed\nRight but it isn't what it says it's what do you call an adjunct auxiliary right or whatever it is it the right to keep and bear arms would be would be feckless without the right to keep them very munitions\nIt's exactly right and and the right to speak of effect was without the right to spend money on that speech\nHuh I'll be darned so once again if you would kind of give out the information for the Goldwater Institute of people want to contribute\nI Will and if you don't mind I've got a quick plug for an event we're having them\nAlso loosely please do I'm I'm going to you\nI'm so tomorrow I'm at a University of Arizona College of law or I Will actually be talking with National Review is David French about this for two hours starting at five thirty\nI'm that event is open to the public it's totally free we encourage people to come and you can find more information on our website but David French has long been an an intellectual hero of mine and it'll be really fun to have him at you or they talked about donor privacy um tomorrow starting at five thirty or the College of law\nAnd I'll be they're recording it and asking you pointed questions wonderful I look forward to this has been a great taught type ... Ingrid has he pointed question in the last couple of seconds hearing or go\nOkay what about jobs corporations that had people investing and publicly traded corporations that come out with him a political view they can you can hear my money for you that we may not agree with you that that I hang up thank you\nUh-huh man great challenge\nI can well and and what the Supreme Court said was the corporations have free speech rights to\n'em and and and what they talk about is between them and their investors and if their investors want them to not talk about a certain topic of their board once I'm not talking about a certain topic\nThat's something they can discuss internally\nAnd make that decision that we can't be in the business is saying the corporations don't at First Amendment right I mean that would shut down this RINO that which I almost radio shows up in New York Times I mean the fact is that most speech is put out by corporations even if their media corporations and because corporations are just some individuals they enjoy rights under the first amendment\n... I Know that the McCain Feingold I I had planned to challenge it myself because I'm buying my radio time and because I wasn't an employee of the radio station McCain Feingold would have been enforceable against me if I ordered a political opinion or an endorsement\nAmazing yeah and I I actually don't want us our guide on to talk to people right and yeah\nYeah or or any other is not just as a Charles ... you know many other companies get this is special treatment or for electric vehicles right who else and who else this show show a\nBMW have electric vehicles Mnuchin has electric vehicles Chevy has to like the last show any company that manufactures elected equals its edge of all a to receive or consumers that buy electric vehicles for those companies are eligible to to um to get the money to get the tax credits\nMartin your area code starts with two oh too so I don't know how familiar you are with Arizona but about ten or no maybe longer about Fifteen Years ago or a little longer we had the or what we call we all fuels crisis here in Arizona are you familiar with it\nNot not not much\nElse have to say well the speaker of the house got involved in a big kind of dust up\nI wouldn't call it a scandal maybe it was a scandal but anyway\nThey promoted the use of all fields where there was a tremendous rebate if you brought bought an alternative fuel car and they thought it would be some small program and it turned out to\nBe a real bite out of the state budget where if people bought an alternative fuel car it didn't you have to run on it and had fed a\nA a propane tank that it couldn't run on and was converted to run on it even if it didn't you basically got back almost fifty percent of the purchase price of the car I'm approximate and I may not have it exactly right anyway backfired and it it costs the speaker his job\nAnd it just I mean it was a real um ... it was a real plus or something or other and it it it actually you know it it royal the states the whole economy for a couple of years\nAnd I don't understand why people don't take a lesson from history and see what happens when you support some industries and not others or you you you know the government gets to choose the winners and losers how do we prevent government\nFrom doing stuff like this\nWell that's a great question and that is at the core of our mission or and what we do at Americans for prosperity a we have a team of amazing actress and grassroots activists across the country where in over thirty six states\nUh we have over a hundred and ten view office just show and their mission is to educate a Americans on on the dangers of of the government having having to go and if the winners and losers and having\nThese programs that do not benefit ... at the end of the day so you know you could claim all the ... as you want but at the end of the day they do not benefit because they did not benefit consumers in in actually frankly\nIt might actually hurt them though I'm a you know the ... energy information administration just recently came out with their um\nAh with her on the survey the rest of the national energy consumption survey and in when you look at the ... you know nearly one third of us ...\nRecorded a facing challenges paying your energy bill or sustaining adequate heating and cooling their homes during twenty fifty and and you know and you see the numbers there and part of that problem in part of the ... the rising energy costs has to do with policies implemented a bygone governments you know\nThey may have well intentioned but they actually end up hurting the people a day they came to to to be protecting or the helped him do so\nThat's why we you know believe in in throughout history as you were saying before Charles' it's been demonstrated that free people free markets are able to achieve a much more than what the government gets in the way\nWell part of the problem is emerging as the government is not address when it comes to responding to a market government is designed\nTo not be changed for what the declaration of independence cause light and transient causes\nAnd I would consider lobbying to promote a company to be a light and transient causes\nAnd so government as good a fairly good at doing fairly large things like the military like ... some ... ... you know some argue against the Federal Reserve\nBut generally speaking the Federal Reserve sort of\n... limits the sways the market sway to some extent makes it harder for us to have happen to another crash that have happened although I Know there's some people have to say that the Federal Reserve causes crashes but anyway I I didn't see we're not on for that discussion what I'm saying is government does large things\nAnd it doesn't respond quickly to small changes in the market and small changes things like the iPhone\nSome changes in the market and small changes things like the iPhone in of itself is a change in the market and government is terrible responding to those things by design is there anybody out there who actually preaches this since Milton Friedman has gone\nWell um I\nI've been to that point I think uh you know how bad government is predicting a shift in the market and I think at\nTextbooks accent that is or what happened in here in America with the stockings evolution so you see you have an interest in it that's recent it's two thousand and five the energy information agency and all this uh\nYou know very smart people that look at a a decision is predicting a rise in consumption on a on coal\nAh for energy plants you know you have a U.S was building a natural gas facilities to see a natural gas imports from abroad\nIn what'd you had there is in into designated sorry two thousand and they you know\nA a individual companies uh individual businesses you know\nA Saudi defective revolution and now you know you have very low natural gas prices and missions in America are going down because of it and this was a market share that no one in government uh was able to predict which is for sea so\nTo your point do I think it it is true and and the second revolution in the scale of the of the transformation that happened in this country or it's just a proof of of how bad government can be in predicting things and you know such a such a major in\nIn ... as the one we saw it in your luggage with defect revolution so\nYeah I totally agree though in in that you know going it's [noise]\nBetter than I Am a production my prediction is going to be some great sponsors coming on and just a

R. S. K. Mart one um [noise]\nWe're we're we're getting very very fancy and calling it to cheat you for generations to [noise] and uh this is a this incorporates all the\nUh is that\nThe secret is getting the hardness and getting the edge holding the resistance to to where which\nWe get for him three Ninety in a play that doesn't become brittle or or lose a toughness and that's that's what Mt Ninety excels at and that's the reason we're using it\nBecause we want a knife that will do all the things you expected to do an everyday use and if you know God Forbid you find yourself in a survival situation where you need to abuse the night it will still stand up to that views\nYou know I've got a bench made in my right pocket it's uh it's my rescue bleed\nAnd that one is the one that's the that's not I think it's maybe the Hindu are designed it may not I don't think it's not I think ... another ... it was designed for another company but the uh the front of the blade is flat so you can use it as a ... pointed\nAnd the edges have bleed has to read but the reason I have the knife is on the other side it has a a fold out seatbelt cutter and this thing will go through several strands of steel both radio without realizing it's there\nAnd that's kinda why I like it is because of the cutter on it\nAnd I know that some nice have got a I've got maybe on the reverse on the back side or on the tip of the blade and got like a duck on it and to make the knife a little bit more universal you're just kind of pure the way it is it it's a knife and it's designed to be a knife and nothing else do you is there a demand in the marketplace for having the blade that will do other things\nWell certainly or the companies that make those lives um wouldn't make them or at least wouldn't make them very long you know they're\nWell cameras camel if they'd go out of business what sorry\nNice and all kinds of uses some are more specialized than others some offer different options you know I my knives have always been a cutting tools uh-huh that's what that's what I design a that's what I carry I'm\nSort of the the universal cutting to ... yeah I mean early I'm and\nI'm ... oldest tools Iraq but I admit a sharp and rock is of knife\nThere you go um this this um you know the other the other side of it is that the sales of these knives and and the reason it was so important for us to get this line launched again with the new manufacture was that uh the money I make selling these\nKnives is what allows me to do knife rights 'cause a knife writes takes up the vast majority of my time so if we have a knife design a bit selling well\nUm that's what allows me the time to to do knife writes without without that income uh I'd have to actually get money from knife rights and that would um certainly impede the our ability to get things to\nTell us about knife rights as long as we're on the topic\nSure I'm\nFor those those if your listeners who aren't familiar with a knife rights organization that I started in two thousand six we really got rolling in two thousand ten um it's you might think of it as the n._r._a. for knife owners\nUm we go round the tiny country getting rid of night fans and legislatively and uh through litigation work were necessary\nTo date in the last eight years we've passed clean I bills and twenty\nEight years we've passed clean nine bills and Twenty one states repealing Knight fans um which I think is a a a pretty good record a nominal\nFor for a small organization um we've had a number of court victories we've been in court in the last ... federal civil rights lawsuit against New York city now for um almost eight years ah that\nThat case a may well be headed to the Supreme Court raising raising the money to to accomplish that\nUm unfortunately uh a litigation in New York even when it's well founded um becomes difficult with a court that isn't a that doesn't look kindly on things like knives and guns and [noise]\nUm ... what is the the progress of the of the lawsuit you might tell people about it 'cause I Know some people who are really in a nice will know about this but I suspect that much of the audience will probably not know about it you might sort of frame it about the the gravity knife crap and then explain your lawsuit and what's going on with it\nSo so New York city uniquely has a developed a test that was a gravity knife or not that I'm\nAs you described earlier as a sort of a risk flick\nThat that test actually has nothing to do with gravity knives but a state courts have agreed that it does [noise]\nUh and that's why we're in federal court a\nBalance somewhere in the order of Seventy dollars and people have been prosecuted in New York City for carrying a common pocket knives that won't get arrested for African thriving live anywhere else in the country [noise] um [noise] uh\nAnd and because the test is so vague\nAnd ridiculous there's no way for anybody in New York City or traveling through New York city to know whether they're knife is legal because it doesn't matter if you can't slip tonight's opening it doesn't matter if you're friends can't risk with eyes open\nAnd as one of our planes has discovered it doesn't matter if a couple of New York city cops can't wrist flip the knife open if you run into a cop with Ken\nI'm you're going to get arrested and and these are these are not\nUm\nParking tickets this is a potential year in jail um if you have a prior it it's going to get bumped up to a felony and unfortunately a number of people carrying pocket knives for work or have ended up with felony convictions um\nFor doing nothing and and you know having no intent to do anything wrong with the knife other than you know use it like we use knives every day [noise]\nUm it's a terrible miscarriage of justice 'em over eighty percent of the person's arrested for carrying a pocket knife common folding knife are persons of color or even in areas that are majority white neighborhood\nUm [noise] and uh\nYou know there there's no more telling example of how this works um the the uh assistant district attorney who's been in charge of this issue for New York city is a Dan Rather junior and yes indeed [noise] he is Dan Rather newsman sun\nAnd the guy in charge of Cyrus Vance junior there you go it's the attack of the juniors yup I'm\nSo it on the witness stand in federal court a under under examining cross examination\nHe admitted that you could go into a a a a sporting goods store in New York or any other store you can test knife twice and it wouldn't risk flick open for you and it would be perfectly legal to buy because that was on the gravity knife\nAnd you could step out the door run into New York city police officer the police officer could risk flick it open and it was now an illegal gravity knife apparently by magic and you would go to jail\nOr something like that like void for vagueness written all over it\nIt it is for vagueness that that is our civil rights claim I'm unfortunately vagueness is a a an an interesting issue from a constitutional standpoint um the Supreme Court has been less than clear as to how it is applied\nA certain circuits like the second circuit have ah let's take a look let's say have\nTheir own interpretation of what it is versus what some other circuits have 'em because the Supreme Court hasn't been so clear 'em and we'll see you know we still have a bunch of money to raise a and not a lot of time to do it so we're working on that um but\nUh and and as you may know I'm getting a a a a ... a accepted granted by the\nBritish or reduce or she already to accept the cage\nIs is is the the odds are long um but you know we don't we don't want to give a\nGovernor Cuomo who twice vetoed a bill that would have solved this problem a mayor de Blasio and da Vinci um eight when that is utterly ridiculous and unjust so\nOh here's a way to fight back how do people contribute to this stuff\nAre they ... they can go to a knife writes dot org ah we have a\nDonation page um donate to the foundation it's tax deductible and uh we could certainly use use all the help we can get this is this is just this is exactly\nThe sort of injustice that all Americans ought to find offensive because there's absolutely no way other than not carrying a knife\nSince shortly after the civil war wow they the the you know there are if if you look at when bad night flaws showed up in a at the state level at least ...\nYou see two waves you see a wave after the civil war particularly in the southern states when a when states decided that they didn't want I'm a recently freed slaves carrying a large knives\nSo you often or saw laws against ... and and like limits and Dirksen daggers in so fast and then in the Nineteen fifties we saw the wave of\nRestrictions on switch laid knives or as you noted we call them automatic night right I'm path and we have been slowly working at getting those\nRepeal their only while there are a number of states with some odd restrictions on the length of a switch late night for where they can carry concealed or not um there were only six states left\nThat absolutely outlaw 'em the possession even possession of a switch late night and and and we're working on that Fifteen states as I say\nLet me let me guess New York Illinois California and no no actually I'm In California has a blade links on automatic nice prescription California\nHas played lake in New York if you have a hunting and fishing licence and you're you can you can see that the automatic nice Illinois restriction uh Illinois total ban on automatic knives was repealed last year really um you do have to have a\nFirearms owners identification card but that's you know\nFor for anyone without a
