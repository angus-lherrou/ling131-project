broadcast week each week and we have anything that you'd like to raise an issue about\nSo handy in Portland asked a very legitimate question background background with un be why don't the folks who\nAre all\nRiled up about politically correct talk to you know you can't say you can't wear some bread roll your anti Hispanic if you wear a some ... to a Halloween party up but then they're totally three to invoke God and Jesus Christ in their language that a fair summation of your comment\nAnd then the question is more on everyone\nElse right correct they're not offended by African okra to\nThat person that they're they're not they're they're not so there there are so many issues that you raised here was so we'll take that one first they're not only not offended on Christians behalf it is not possible in there\nNot only not offended on Christians by half it is not possible in their view to offend Christians there is as you probably know a famous or infamous art work quote unquote with a crucifix in the jar of the urine of the so called artist\nNow uh as I tweeted out last week if you put a uh if if you put a ... Iran in urine or you would be an Islamic fold if you put a tour in urine you would be an anti Semite if you put a crucifixion you're and you're an artist\nAnd and I tweeted that very exact that word for word what I just said for that crowd ... is not only not possible to offend Christians to the best of your ability you showed\nSo uh is that that this is ultimately a war against the Judeo Christian civilization that the west has built I Am convinced that that is the ultimate ... of the left\nThey hate the idea of a Bible based value society they're frightened by it and they hate it now the second issue is the use of the terms God and Jesus Christ it depends on the context so I Would say for example\nIf somebody says God did you see that home run I Do not believe they're violating the commandment against using God's name and paying\nA lot of people do and I don't and I explained what I think\nThe commandment really means because I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew that commandment these do not carry God's name in vain not to do not take God's name and fame and the people but I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil\nBecause that is the only one of the ten commandments that God says he will not forgive\nIt so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive murder but he won't forgive that\nSo it has to be really bad since that's what set it said God will not forgive those who violate that amendment and it is doing evil in God's name\nThat is that's the worst evil atheist evil is evil religious evil is the most evil the Islamic to or doing evil in in their God's name are doing more harm to God and religion\nThan any atheist group that has ever existed okay it was a very important thing and you should all watch my my uh eleven videos at ... university on the ten commandments and read my

organization tell us a little bit about it\n[noise] yeah so it is um you know our goal is really to cover politics and and and public policy or in Arizona but try to do it in a little bit of a different way I you know I've my background is in politics and public policy was\nWithout the air is on the Capitol times for a last Thirteen Years something like that\nAnd you know and you know I working there you know we we did a lot of really great in depth coverage of what was happening at the state capital a and and\nI I I left there and I took over there isn't a Center for investigative reporting and was there for almost two years and you know really when I wanted to to find an opportunity to find a way to to take some of the\nSome of the the storytelling and and some of the the the journalism techniques that I'd I'd learned over daisy CIA are and and really apply it directly to politics and public policy and and and be able to to cover those important issues that are there issues that are important but they're really I think fundamentally not interesting to a lot of people\n[laughter] you know as important as they are as\nMuch direct effect as they have people's lives it's tough to get people engaged in them and and so what we really I I think our goal is to try to do is to to to cover\nPublic policy at the state level in in something of a new way and and and really try to to put a human face on it and try to to tell to tell stories that actually resonate with\nWith people who are otherwise consumed with their jobs and they're in their daily lives they don't have a lot of a lot of room to follow politics the way you know a nerd like me might uh and and and and try to get people\nTo understand the importance of of white matter what happens is the state capital why it matters who your governor is or who your state legislator is uh or or even you know\nWho your who who your city councilor who your school board representative this those things you know really do matter and they they really those are the people who create policies that are going to affect your life in day in day out a but but unfortunately it's you know it is very tough to get people interested in and I think\nA lot of that has to do with the way that the way the media covers those issues and and\n... and and in particular the way that that reporters tend to talk to other people who are already paying attention\nWell that's the sort of as as opposed to people who you know might check in on a political story or a week or once a month\nAnd you bring up a good point about and we've all been trying to figure this out how to you cover the boring but important in ways that matter to people but\nUh we're going to get into some of the stories that you guys have already covered in the first month but there's another hurdle newspapers are\nIn this fight for relevancy and frankly ad dollars and you have this bright idea to launch basically a new one I notice that a newspaper it's an online operation but what were you thinking why would you think that this would work\nWell you know I I think the difference between a before what we're doing and and and

Jeremy due to them what my my associate editor you know dug into what exactly what's going on here and do a lot of the court records\nYou know in terms of turned up the fact that this was at a company to basically trying to\nTake it back on the election to to get some free free advertising but to get some some exposure or with some signs that that are illegal but blend into a lot of other campaign signs and so I'll probably not going to be taken down by city told officials are and and\nEven though they are they're definitely I mean there's there's no legal like for these things to stand on I mean\nBut the transportation worker driving around is not going to like take the initiative to start pulling these things up right\nProbably not I mean they might now they've got some media attention\nI'm not sure which is what they were looking for in the first place well which it would work\nOh sure who which is what they were looking for in the ... what would you do the work that was started right you know so I'm\nCertainly our story was you know and and the blog posts we wrote on it was was effectively you know with these things are these things are scams you do get into this don't don't don't give these people any any attention and just know that these things are illegal and and my my hope is certainly the city code enforcement is going to go out there and start pull\nThese things it's like click bait on the on the roadside there so\nI Do and and but it's it's a weird strategy right because I don't know how many have you guys have run into people who say God I really love campaign season 'cause I Love\nSeeing all everywhere they white enough the intersection has their own I'm an actor and so after I wrote yeah\nYeah and and so it's it's kind of a weird you know I I get to the science get to stay up because they blend in with the other things that are out there but there are things are blending in with the things that people generally I think\nDislike and complain about so it's kind of an odd I'm an odd way to promote your business is to say hey look we're doing that thing that you hate everyone else for doing\nAnd your your site or you've got a lot of topics education immigration politics long government investigations things like that but you're also doing some commentary and you just wrote a piece and the headline is due Latinos make Arizona worse conservatives and Republicans\nThink so and so now you are walking this fine line between your the news guy\nAnd you were the opinions guy and I do that by the way I'm Still uncomfortable with it\nBut it's but it has to be done because you need both you know what you're wearing when you're doing now I Do but it is a you and I were talking earlier about how trust is everything with a ... if you don't have their trust and it took me awhile to build the trust to do that but\nYou guys are Jim right out of the gate you're you're writing commentary and uh how how are you deciding what you're covering and\nHow strong it's dance or you're going to take in the future will you guys do you ever see your cells endorsing propositions or candidates anything like that\nUm you know we're certainly not this time I mean I I don't know we we don't have an editorial boards or say to you know it's really kind of weigh in on those things\nUm it's something we might evaluated the future I you know for writing for right now I mean the the opinion pieces are um primarily in the coming from me and and I think we'll have some some other guests columnist on and gifts in writers who are who are going to come in either on a regular\nSemi regular basis to to provide some opinions um you know is it in terms of\nUm you know deciding what to cover I mean one of the great things about doing something like this you know we've got we've\nGot full editorial in it and you know our job as professionals of the things that that that we see that are important and the stories you know especially the the stories that are important that just aren't getting told elsewhere on that that no one else is is seeing recovery\nUm you know in in in terms of the the thing is that you're right I mean that trust is is important um you know and and and how far you go with that I I think it's a challenge um for for me I mean my Ninety percent of I think the writing that I'll do will probably end up being opinion pieces as opposed to to a new space is just because of my role as\nAn editor and I'll be the primary columnist for lack of her work\nUh for for our operation um you know and um and then my job be up beyond that is going to be directing the news coverage and working with reporters and editing their stories and getting stuff like that up a a you know um but the you know I I think opinions are they're they're important I think to\nUm you know both at the health to ... help inform people I mean I think that if you do opinion writing right I mean I think it's not just ... I think it's it's it's you know being able to tell us or into English courting you know within ... within your opinion writing\nDoing some real analysis and showing your work rather than oh here's what I Believe because ...\nYes and that's so important and you have to help the community set the agenda and understand what's important to them and everything but Jim because your expertise I Want to throw one last question that you signed up for us the mix Sally cinema Senate race\nBoy I it's going to be I think this was going to be one um you know a cinema has had the early advantage I think in this race um and I think for the most part most polling we've seen recently showed that she still has an advantage but it definitely tightening you know I think she's had a last couple of weeks a particular\nIf you're saying you don't know you're probably not going to take the time to deal with it\nAnd there's a bigger question getting people out to the polls which a gym was saying and you were to uh that uh it's all about turnout this time and so\nUh getting the people who have decided to actually go to the polls so lots of things to look for in a in this mid term election that's one of them are you a blank more like who who who writes for you was not impressed with Nick Pearson and he is a Republican candidate\nIn CD three going up against rolled ... and he had an interesting column where it's basically a good luck\nBecause role is almost unbeatable I have not figured out why but\nOther Republicans have never really been able to put up somebody I'm against him or the last time was two thousand ten Ruth ... came pretty close to knocking them off and that was the year of the Tea Party yeah and then pretty close means ah\nTen points yeah ... ... which\nIn you know ah other races would be a landslide\nYeah he was nervous that you can say that you had a truly did she have a chance as well Jesse Kelly almost beat Gabby Giffords then that would uh would have been a surprise and that one came right down to the wire but what is what's the what's Blake's message and all this\nI'm Blake more or less are what the devil will tell you tone is a points out is to take that a ... is just you know firmly entrenched into the college ... Blake wrote and eh\nOn feeding him is pretty much a suicide mission or you you you know and it's probably not going to happen and it certainly won't happen if Republicans continue to run a\nI Can't say ... and is terrible he's no Joe Sweeney or anything like that you're out of the perennial candidate to ah just made a a complete a foolish shambles out of a series of elections\nBut he's not a good solid candidate much less a great candidate and it would take a great candidate somebody who really knows the details in demonstrates that they are ready to step in and do the job and in that debate here in\nA\nReally showed that he doesn't get the details he couldn't say any of the committees he might want to serve on he pretty much going against the message of the Republican Party he said that there should be a universal standard for drinking water at the federal level and we've kind of their\nHead that Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd you know as a good point in his column too but you know I call him in my own mind I've never said it publicly but the ... of of this race and she is a Democrat who is in the city to primary who on paper looked absolutely\nAwesome but was not a I felt like she was somewhat of a weak campaign or and I think it would\nBe almost a mirror image actually yeah I could learn about the ... has a link the resume extensive experience terrific knows are incredible details about how the federal government works\nBecause she helped run large chunks of it right but yet she was not a you know the most dynamic of campaigners certainly and didn't get jobs because of that\nAnd that was an unfortunate because I really kind of thought that she was going to catch fire and uh and really challenging for Patrick can agree\nAgree with her policy statements or not you couldn't deny that she knows all heck of a lot of\nHeat is absolutely that's what I'm saying on paper she was a pretty strong candidate so are you had a a interesting story by Betty beard who wrote about jobs growth and basically saying Arizona is flush with jobs more jobs than people who are moving into the state which we're getting an awful lot of them\nAnd this is good news for Arizona I guess\nWell I mean do do you need you need to have jobs whether those jobs are in the right places at the right wages is another story right but we are getting close to what economists\nCall a functional\nFull employment the unemployment rate\nAh did a a bump\nUp last month I think it was a tenth of a point\nBut uh the uh state economists are pointing out that\nMost people who are actively looking for a job or a only on the job market for a month or five weeks or so in a managed to ah find themselves that position\nSo were there were always be people who don't have jobs you wouldn't have a job market if there weren't people looking for work and employers looking to hire people so you you need to have a you know a little bit of a flux going on there so that the ... the system actually works but\nArizona is growing it's a number of open positions in a number of fill positions actually I should say faster than the number\nAnd a number of fill positions actually I should say faster than the number of people who are moving here which is a you know probably a good thing\nAnd it's definitely a good thing you just don't want the word to get out that you can feel that the job demands but as you were saying where are those jobs and uh\nI ... and do they pay in ... and one of the fact that employers are having to search a little bit harder does put some upward pressure on wages\nAnd the in the Phoenix area when and I grew up in that area is a lot more expensive than it used to be and it really surprises me every time I go back there have zero desire to to head back to\nYou know that pile of people but it is far inland yeah exactly but you know kind of where the where the action is but I Wonder if it's going to lose its a label as being very very affordable is Arizona has always been in retrospect it of course you compare yourself to California and the east coast pretty much anybody is going to look for\nTo dramatically affordable you're comparing herself to coastal California\nBut it's getting up there and ah so that's a little bit of a a little bit of a surprise I Want to take us down to a motto now about an hour ago I talked to a check Huckleberry the county administrator and they're still little befuddled and maybe a little surprised at the lack of response from a doctor\nWho has the responsibility of cleaning out under bridges and we're talking specifically about the so pre wash bridge\nAnd uh on September second those Labor Day weekend we had a huge amount of rain down in that area is comes roaring down the wash and it hits a ten foot wall under the ... bridge which was supposed to be cleared and as a doubts responsibility is all\nThe the debris the tree limbs and well stuff that's piled up there over the years\nRight and it is um it's really hard packed dirt and there's actually a tree growing out of it which tells me that uh and there's one person has been on a person Santa Cruz county said that he thinks it's been Nineteen years because that's a long it's been on the job he's ever seen it cleared out so we're going after eight out and saying what's going on here\nOr why wasn't this cleared up now I Want to be clear that number one this was an almost unprecedented\nRainfall down there in the short amount of time and so it was the rainfall that was the true culprit but the fact is the washes designed to do certain things and there was an awful lot of dirt built up there so eight out has\nTo this point not taking responsibility we've been hammering their communications team we're done with that because they are [noise]\nUm it's very clear that this is going to the legal department and that it is above their pay grade and we'll see how a doubt response to this but we have a couple of business owners down there who are\nReally suffering as a result the cow palace which is a Ninety eight year old historic restaurant in that area\nOr may not reopen no decision yet it has not been condemned them saying that I'm just saying that it is it really hard hit hard and they still haven't worked out the insurance and who knows whether\nAnything from the state might help out and I'm Talking in terms of some sort of deal with with eight out and I don't know how quickly it moves but being a the bureaucracy of a state agency probably not\nReal fast so if you if you look at the number of the people whose job it is to inspect bridges and keep track of these things there are a precious few running around this very large state and even though we don't have a lot of flowing rivers here we do have a whole lot of bridges\nYou and you would hope that at least once every Nineteen years someone could get over there and said hey\nMaybe we could clean this out so we'll see actually this is what happened so we're still asking questions and looking for a requesting records and\nNot being a public agency they have to give them up but a lot of times they'll they'll drag their feet so we'll see actually what what happens and I want to contrast this with Freeport Mac Moran which is to the mine down on the edge of green valley there were a couple of deft events a couple of weeks ago\nAnd they are sending the cause of death over the community and into homes\nAnd uh this they\nAre immediately acknowledge that it was their responsibility and their failure to do what they were supposed to do
