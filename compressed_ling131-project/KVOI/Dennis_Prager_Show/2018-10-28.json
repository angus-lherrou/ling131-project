a an enemy and went down a little downhill from there but I'm Glad to have you back on the air you were on with your a book about energy with ms white\nAnd we did two hours on that book if you'll recall so first hour with the second person our with her and the second hour with you and I wanted to get your uh your bio right with the uh for the audience\nAnd introduce you properly but I'm Mr Moore is an advisor to President Trump is an economic advisor he's been he's involved with Arthur Laffer of the last of the Laffer curve fame and a Nobel Prize for that\nAnd he's here to talk today about prop one twenty seven which is the energy requirement to get fifty percent or more of energy from a renewable energy sources\nAnd you're a you're not very in favor of that are you\n[laughter] I I think it would be a monumental a stupid thing for Arizona to do I think it would be really bad for the economy of Arizona and I think it would not even help the environment one\nIota will not reduce global warming it will not help clean up the air or it is a very bad idea and I'm I'm really thankful that you're letting me explain to people why this is another way we're all for clean air were out for you know uh you know making sure that um\nArizona has the has the most the cleanest environment and safest for our health but this will do nothing about that it will simply enrich the green energy lobby and the green energy industry at a very high cost of the poorest Arizonans\nI Want to do more proper introduction for the audience and you know you're listening to Mr more as an American writer and economic policy and us analysts he founded and served as president of the club for growth from Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand for\nI mean he's a former member of the wall Street Journal editorial board in two thousand fourteen the Heritage Foundation announced that Mr Moore would become ... chief economist which is quite a thing in two thousand Fifteen or ... or ... ... um title at the Heritage Foundation change from chief economist\nTo his current title distinguished visiting fellow\nAnd uh he Mr Moore is known for advocating free market policies and supply side economics in two thousand Seventeen he left Fox News to joined CNN\n[laughter] this is an economics analyst and he is a has been quietly nominated for the Nobel Prize people don't know this\nFor successfully discovering the formula to Dr Paul Krugman insane based on his short drive economic theory consisting of the three words he already is so now welcome to to live [laughter]\nThank you for it by the way you would have one of the most important things which was I was a senior economic advisor with Rick I vote for the rights campaigner thousands sixteen which there's a lot of fun and and I know that this is not the topic of his conversation but sometime in the next month or so we should a new book is al ...\nAre hitting the newsstand this I'm In a couple of weeks and\nUh you know it's a it's about that kind of a A R a\nHow we how we you know trying to turn Donald Trump on the pro free market economic policies but the last few weeks I've been really spending a lot of time on this Arizona no shift 'cause there are a number of states like Arizona\nA New Mexico is another one about a a New York um Colorado are are are thinking about\nAn acting out through the ballot measures that would require massive amounts of green energy which is\nMuch much much much more expensive to buy them or you know natural gas or nuclear or whatever and it will it will impose you know we estimate I did a study for the Goldwater as to which you know that's right\nThat's how I got to you today\nPlay to die that gold plated Institute there and that Arizona and um we town we all we did we did was just said okay let's just look at the states that have these\n\nOh\nWith them back to liberty watch where we have the joy of pleasure of having this Stephen Moore he's an advisor to President Trump and alone with Larry Kudlow and he's also written a number of books and\nThe last book was his new book coming up is trumping comics inside the America First plan to revive our economy which will be coming out and about six weeks\nAnd plan to have Mr Moore back on this is a pub if he'll have his publicist get in touch with me and get me the copy of the book you know electronic leader physically I'd be happy to have it either way is probably one of the few upkeep\nBut we're talking about prop one twenty seven\nAnd the which would require would mandate Arizona energy companies to get at least fifty percent of their energy from so called renewable sources without including all renewable sources the question is and Mr Steiner who's massively supporting this economically uh California billionaire\nHe says that it'll it'll help with jobs how would it affect jobs if this were to pass\n[noise] well that's a good question I mean first of all they're saying that would call it ... that they would\nCause a lot more jobs to build the solar and wind farms and so on um which you know you might get more jobs but that would be you know you have to pay for those jobs through higher rates right now what about your power in other words you want to get the most electric power the least cost not the highest cost and sometimes environmentalist\nI kept at a mixed up but that where you would see a loss of jobs would be if your energy prices go up by fifty to a hundred percent which is what we're estimate it will happen that Arizona relatively becomes a less I'm\nCompetitive place to do business in right I mean energy as a major class are producing everything from you know two faced a computer computers and uh you know food and everything and so you would get\nJobs that would leave Arizona and they would go to other states that have lower energy costs at the march on and so you would probably see I think on balance a loss of jobs shift Arizona passed this initiative\nOf the states that have this type of initiative in California has no one does happen to energy prices in California\nWell first of all I can I just say why would you ever want to do anything uh California does right ... yeah I mean I I think we get we could just close the argument they say California is doing this already and you know what's happening in California that's why every time I go to the great state of Arizona all all I see is people moved out of California\nThere are there and show how crazy there in Chicago except the novel is except the problem is we get this elite is from neutral here\n[laughter] it's an inside job yes that's my high school like I mean I think that um you know the California has\nVery very high energy costs it's something that's hurting the middle class there that's why what's happening in a in ... California is it is a great state deliberate if you're really really really rich like you made millions and billions of dollars and you know I saw valley\nOr ... or ... or if you work for government\nYeah or if you've worked for government or for middle classes leaving 'cause they can't afford the high class and energy costs are one of them ... yeah no you don't want to be like California you don't want to be like New York you don't want to be like a New Jersey those are the states that have very high energy costs and they have these green energy policies and you know it's it's it's called that chasing the losers you don't want to chase the losers you want to chase the winner of\nFlorida by the way which is a state very comparable to Arizona\nIn terms of climate in terms of sunshine and all these things Florida does not have a renewable energy standard and they have among about the cheapest energy costs of any state in the country\nYou know is California where a dog it would be one that chased parked cars\n[laughter] well that's why you don't want to chase you don't want to chase California pretty soon you're going to have the access to California has any\nAll of these other things by the way I was involved and\nOpening up that you know ridiculous you know\nMassive tax increase at the uh the uh Arizona Education Association wanted to to uh to massively increased I think they wanted to double the income tax for you know so thank God you dodged that bullet now you've got a dad this bullet a on a on a week from Tuesday\nMhm I'm of the states that have this that have this already but I'm a I'm from renewable energy mandate of the states that have this how many have done it by legislative acts and how many have done it by ballot\nQuestion I Believe I don't know the answer my hunch is that most of them have passed it legislatively\nAh because like you know half the states don't even have the the initiative a referendum process that you out there on our right so I I Would say that most of them have have passed it through the legislature right because it does that late this one of the things about your process there in Arizona I'm not an expert on how your\nI Would say that most of them have have passed it through the legislature right because it does that late this why are things about your process there in Arizona I'm not an expert on how you're in a ballot initiatives work but I'm the old\nThat watch something like that the staff has got forbidding people vote for this massive increase in cost if it happens then it sort of enshrined in your constitution well even\nEven if it's this is a constitutional amendment it's in the one hundred the constitutional amendments are one hundreds the uh initiatives or to hundreds a referendum three hundred rich and so and the local the local issues are for hundreds in Arizona but um this one\nIs a constitutional amendment and it would take a constitutional amendment to fix it\nIf if anything needs to be changed the legislature we also have something called and there was another one I think it was ironically also called one on one twenty seven I Can't remember which ... number but it's it it put it in the constitution that the legislature can't change it\nBut if it's put in by ballot it has to be altered by ballot unless it further is the idea behind why the ballot measure was was originally installed but even if it's not a constitutional change\nIt has the effect of being a constitutional change even if it's not because once it's enshrined in law by ballot the legislature can't do anything to it\nYeah and that they don't show that that gets to the point I was making which is why just a sure thing to do that kind of wise thing to do is not pass fish because you're if you do you're locking yourself into something over the next Twenty years you know that you know but like all the time I say oh well we know that these sort of all the while maybe they will maybe they won't that\nYou're going to get a better future of the state on that\nYou know I really I mean it's a big gamble you're taking whereas like let's say they they've turned out to be right and that solar costs fall and when ... all over time that's what it's going to happen under the market people use more\nYeah they'll go to our local to its don't you don't need to force people to do something that's in their own interest in royal enlightened lightened self interest is the best driver a mini market but here you got it why do\nThese are required on energy a renewable energy renewable energy mandates why do these ... what are they due to the prices why are they drive 'em up\nBecause there's more sponsors you know now that we have massive federal subsidies that the federal level ... basically for wind and solar they get thirty percent tax credit which means thirty percent off of every time a you know a dollar of a energy is produced from window and or a\nSolar thirty cents of that is paid by the taxpayer does you know that\n... I I read it in your study rather drive article but I didn't know before they could\nThink of can you think of any other industry and all of America got thirty seconds chef every dollar they produce subsidized by the federal government\nYes I mean the Amtrak shade really if I can so yes Amtrak if it weren't\nIf it were not for about thirty percent tax credit there would be no wind and solar they keep saying how cost effective it is no I mean actually even when we when we tried to get rid of the\n... uh you know that that corporate welfare\nOr you know the industry said gee if you get rid of this we're going to be run out of business well that that's an indication that too\nIt's not too efficient so you get big big um even with those big federal subsidies wind and solar still pretty expensive 'cause let the big story of energy lately since the last decade is the cost of natural gas has fallen by two thirds used to be ten dollars per\nMillion cubic feet now it's three dollars so you know it's hard for everybody to compete with cheap\nNatural gas and that gets crowded out because they don't as you just said at the outset of the show they don't count natural gas or nuclear power as renewable energy\nAnd what could be more renewable I Know that makes\nThe anti new people just insane but\nSomeday maybe I'll get a ... a Nobel nomination for driving them no no no shit [laughter] you know you know when I actually like to see is I'd actually like to see a dual\nWith a with air soft guns between you and ... you know wearing a appropriate the protective gear of course maybe paintball might be you know you take him but\nDo you have a couple of years ago and I ain't never agreed to debate in the sense became an sliced and bump into ... or you know like I think everybody\nWould agree that um the best thing for Arizona do is to vote no on the ... should have you know we'll see we'll continue to seize technology progressed and when this all but we're also going to continue to see the technology you know you know it might be these small nuclear now they're talking about small nuclear reactors that would be you know one tempt as large\nOr expand empowerment scholarship accounts for it basically what it does is allows more people to for the money to follow the children in education vote yes it's a good idea empowerment scholarships or a great idea\nIt's not perfect but the bill strengthens Arizona's role leading the nation and school choice\nAnd if we somehow hit the target of thirty thousand enrollment positive or the positive effects of this of cascade from increased interest and the success this will start\nAn education revolution throughout I wouldn't say revolution they'll start an education reverberations throughout the country if Arizona where to pass this other states will follow our lead and it is a way of breaking the stranglehold ... in in part it's it makes education better but it also makes\nIt helps to break the stranglehold that government has an education it'll make your choices much more free\nUm it said you know ... it's a it's a better idea it's a better way to do things installed competing more competition into the education system and no it won't be fund public education at all what it'll do is cause the funding to follow the kid rather than to follow the district\nAnd that's a better thing because whether we'll do is in power the choice of parents so it's a yes on three o five three oh six is also a yes\nStopped the candidates for giving taxpayer clean funds to their parties also clean the ... elections commission over say there's a problem with the cleanup elections committee and let's see I think we have a guest calling in and liberty watch as this Mr Holden\nIt is high Mr do you're right I hear it's okay to worry about it you're on the air right now so let's just talk about your you have a concert coming up tell us about\n... thank you um so I lead in Concord voices and orchestra it's two sons only Grammy nominated professional choir and orchestra we are doing a concert that is a tribute to veterans and to our hero active us service personnel\nOn this program ah is all American composers we start with Daniel barbers during\nFanfare for the common man which was originally a tribute to World War two\nThem then we\nGo on and we foreign Samuel barbers poignant I dodged you'll for strange made famous in that movie platoon ...

I I Am bore intoxication I Am no problem with people using alcohol recreational drugs are just stupid because they they come to own you\nBut you know then again I Know people who are recreational marijuana users who haven't let it get a hold of them it's kind of hard not to you know because the highest so the ... that they get the most people can and so\nI ... addictive which is more emotionally addictive necessarily sometimes and physically\nBy the same token I'm more concerned about the government's reaction the way the government treats it than I Am about whether or not somebody abuses abuses some substance or even really the bottom line it's your body you own it the government doesn't even if it includes your your demise\nIt's your body you wound you I'm more worried about the government's overreaction to your use of it than I Am about your use of it I'd love to hear your comment and feel free to criticize both me and my opinion\n[laughter] that's what I said to um no I agree with you needed states want to make it as a marijuana or something that's fine with the state's right ... the preeminent at the original intent of the founders\nAre on as far as to talk about whether it's why why now or Coco tea when I was in the end with the uh I'm not a a people\nOr in the embassy there they would use that for a altitudes that there's a original that there's a ... any kind of real drug\nWas two fold it was spiritual use in a ceremony I just kind of like you see why in a lot of churches um more Senegal or or\nOr synagogue or for or medicinal and so it was a sacrament tobacco for example\nThe uh first export of America was originally originally a Akron that's all a product of the latest people that's going to a time with your algae decoder I'm In I'm even though I've told her that that the original tobacco\nAnd to give a cancer it's a misuse\nUnless you've talked about because I've gone pop culture is just designed to separate your friend of mine ... family got your freedom that recently so that's when you get into 'em using the Miss USA a an overview so\nYeah ... it's not a sacrament\n[laughter] again after all no because I think that's a process that's a process they complain\nI use it when I was a especially with snow capped would hit a plus a cocaine addict and ... or cherry coke of a huge has been done from time immemorial but it's when you start adding ask leach and that's when you get ... you can see that the\nPeasants in then I get people to do with the that there would just be destroyed\nI have a question for you and you would know this is a former drug enforcement agency agent uh agent is possession of the coca leaf itself illegal\nAh I don't\nI think it is I'm not sure um\nBecause I was thinking if a person just handed cocoa leaf plant normally wanted to do is to on the leaves and you know and not sell it to anybody and not promoted to anybody I Wonder if it's even illegal\nI don't think it is I think that's a tough call chain or I mean they used to have cocoa can't when I was in the embassy or in various uh South American countries Olivia a chilling for going in the ... um and I'm not sure he is I mean that's free yeah\nQuinine or barking aspirin all this comes from you know ... and stuff like that but I'm not sure you know you're asking me to\n... well I mean I didn't plan it but it's what comes up that would be an interesting thing to know because if somebody really I mean I really we really wonder I Wonder if somebody had cocaine addiction if chewing on a cocoa leaf wouldn't be healthier way than you know or someone who to heroin addiction if chewing coca leaves\nWouldn't be a way to assuage the the withdrawal symptoms of it I don't know I'm not I'm not an expert in any way shape or form and I remember study did but I just wonder if that wouldn't be a more natural way to bring somebody away from an addiction\nBeen involved a lot of stuff and broke and some are important stories so it would be covering\nThe whistle blowing the government corruption intelligence on force meant a military uh for example um with the tragic\nSynagogue shooting mhm I yesterday\nI was on the range or doing any warrior school training\nCourse for an arm a church one of the largest churches in Tucson their armed security team and we heard about that while we were training and uh you know that's very relevant because these guys were preparing for\nA while the other a synagogue was getting hit\n... you know\nSometimes you see these things and sometimes they they look like a set up or things aren't aren't as they appear to be like for instance this ah the fellow that they arrested for sending the bombs out at least if you follow the news and mailing them to people who are opponents of the current president\nIf you ... at least according to the news it sounds fairly solid than it was him but based on your experience an investigation and some of your contacts\nYou don't always think that what's in the news is the true story to explain how that works and then tell us specifically about this one was ... and please don't use the perpetrators name we don't like to give them\nAlong with the D. I. initiative don't inspired evil initiative we like to not say the name of the perpetrator to do the one thing they would like to have happened witches have their name mentioned but please go ahead\nNo certainly I have spoken with a half a dozen a federal\nAnd local fellow\nPolice officers or investigators or federal agents\nAnd you know my my uh government a\nCode was Eighteen of Evan was criminal investigator or for almost two decades and everyone I spoke to we all said the same thing is\nWe've never seen a case a this clean this cut and dry and if you are and and also with the explosive devices mhm yeah they were the explosive devices but so is a firecracker\nOr and your and I'm Talking about I've handled and I've done a lot of explosives a worker explosive breaching a handle on how to see for the the mail um devices were they had every indication that they were\nA letter bombs first thing that didn't look right now that you get ... DNA every day and it but if you know investigation that that clean not easy and the the the pictures of the van\nA ... you know I have a hard time seeing that there would not be any uh I'm a tag in a van like that uh-huh with all the plug Trump stuff out there and if you go back on his to associate you'd go backwards and what\nWas left keeps uh get in trouble with whether it's or or or Medicaid or a\n... page Rosenthal of those guys ...\nLee ... Rosenstein of those guys strollers\nDay is their social media apps them and if you go backwards with this guy social media or he was until twenty stitched e a a rabid left wing or\nReally avid Democrat really really his van his his van did not have anything on it or back in twenty six key how do we know that\nThere's there was if you go to his social media you can see the van had no photos on that no stickers\nStickers at that at that time and that he does this about face and he doesn't get any of it as a left wing French criticizing huh so it looks a lot like\nA a set up and what we're looking for as investigators as we're looking for patterns right patterns of behavior especially their intelligence officer a and there's a big difference between a criminal investigation where are you looking for evidence ... intelligence where you're looking for a indicators dashed to guess\nBut the patterns or with this guy\nLook like a that for most of his adult life and by the way he is not Native American you know I I have native heritage and I'm a very proud of that and uh he has not made his his heritage is Filipino\n... that's another miss characterization there's a native peoples are are very patriotic he joined the military\nYou look at the code talkers code talkers there's and there's lots of besides Navajo there's branch of the many uh even though they've been the most mistreated or people of all in America there are still extremely\nYou know when we weren't so hot we weren't so hard on the blacks before the Eighteen sixties either\nYou know that's very true very true but my point is we fixed it but you know go ahead you're on your point is that the point is\nThat if we look at uh the pattern of behavior with the left and I talking about going back to the socialist communist I'm ... and how it started with he was fast and furious and with Clinton and Obama\nReally how it started with you ... how what story would you please ...\n... covert operations uh-huh so they made the statement that\nThe Mexican gun violence was due to American a gun store stores in Arizona and Texas selling guns to the drug cartels right\nAnd you know I was the liaison with the ATF I I had a desk ATF office I Know all the ATF whistle blowers in fast and furious personally ... speech engine everything whether I mean simply not true every every dime store owner\nHas an ATF card right behind it and if there's anything fishing there the first\nTo call that in that was not the reality at all the reality was that the United states government our main export is arms and the United states government so lots of arms to the government of Mexico and show\nWhich might which then migrated to the cartels\nThe government of Mexico has been bought off by the fed nearly a cocktail and the United states government has been a had a deal with the sitting alone cocktail because these cartels are so massive but the point is that\nObama what Obama and Clinton tried to say wasn't true so if when socialist scripts don't follow reality you have to they have to try and make reality hit their script\nAnd that is what it looks like is what's happening uh uh with this shooter\nHuh okay we've got a caller who wants to talk to you and it's a Philip Philip you're alive on America armed and free with just pray there go right ahead and asking me questions\n\nI can barely hear you get closer to your phone no you're you're like out in the west but try now go ahead\nYou hear me now yeah go ahead\nYeah I'm about to mail a bomber or nail non ... ... the set up and down the evidence that I'd like to see is the weather in aging other eke out the window who I guarantee you that they're not ... age and whether that will never see that that again\nHave thank you that's a really good point by the way have you seen that video that's going around with the speed it up FBI trying to put a tarp over the top of the over the top and sides of the van or to the theme of the Benny Hill of the Benny Hill show\nNo but that fits in with another state and I was going to make and your caller is right on\nYeah he is with the with the ah Waco back on yeah no\nI was actually going through you know we're both fires instructors I became a federal firearms instructor in Nineteen Ninety three at the FBI Academy\nIs the d._a. used to go we still use that ranges mhm and um I remember ah the women and children the and burned up in Waco right and ... and and from my native heritage day I Know that's not right but after Waco you know what the FBI did with the crime scene\nOh yeah they they bulldozed at ... and they hit the evidence\nRight and and putting a tarp over the van ... this is not a new pattern\nAnd and plus when we look at me and McKay and Brennan deejay in the in the intelligence community or just a terrible terribly corrupt\nYou know it's interesting to hear somebody formally formally involved in it and make that statement\nAnd it's also interesting we're at the bottom of the hour and we I don't want to talk more about the synagogue shooting them a little bit and things people can do and also the possibility of having a radio program right here on this very station\nAnd will do that after the bottom of the hour break on Jim ten thirty TV oh I live in local and we were in the perfection auto works studios at five to zero\nSeven nine zero two zero four zero we'll be back right after the [noise]\nKnow we have a yeah we have an EMT gummy and a ... ... trains on each other a quite a bit if it's a military course I mean we even I've been stuck many times and gun used to do a lot of heat is not in the military procedure any more about a combination of dominance and are on like tissue\nAnd ... and the lowest ranked students in\nThe class [laughter]\nI mean for what ... what were your school was doing a lot of a five day period of very courses we actually bring in a helicopter to evacuate ah when I was working with the PGA is quite a bit I've done a lot of work\nThat produces the air force special forces offense like don't worry Jeff [noise] [laughter]\nYeah we love abbreviations in the get go that yeah we\nDo it do it ... to [laughter] not a problem not a problem I'm just giving you a hard time for Jurgen but so you can you teach people it's it's not just shooting skills it's it's observational skills how do you teach people to be more observant\n\nSo ... one of the first things is to get off your device the other thing is to be looking around you or the next thing is to be looking in Des ... you know anybody who's been through any training you know it was the um the juggler with the guerilla die in a gorilla suit\nGetting off the elevator and no one she's got the first time I don't know if you've ever seen that video and training\nWell I didn't notice [laughter] uh I uh you you have to be you have\nTo learn how to she better and uh I says she hears to here and it's and it's interesting because\nA first world people specialize in seeing close books a screens where\nI'm third world people\nSee far they're looking for game they're looking for enemies they're looking at a distance and there's been many times you know like in Lawrence of Arabia ... uh where the first world person can't she would be a third world person can see without any binoculars\nOr anything but it's a matter of training as a matter of
