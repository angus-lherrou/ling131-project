I got to do anything so why did your jaw drop\nOff because I think that if you like he doesn't you know when I called before me was saying that if the if you look at the the history of how you know genesis you argue that\nThere are no no it's not me they issue on the age of the earth is not based on genesis genealogy it's based on believing that the six days of creation were six twenty four hour days Adam is and create it till the end of the six day\nThat's ... so you can only believe that the earth is a few thousand years old if you take literally\nThat each of the creation days is twenty four hours but the sun has not created for days how can you have a day without the sun also the word Yom in Hebrew\nWhich is the word for today is used in so many context for example genesis to five and says this is the creation of the world in the day that God created the heavens in the year\nSo clearly day doesn't mean one day also got calls light day and dark night\nSo God himself uses the term Yom in in a different way than the twenty four hour a day so there's there's just no listen I don't have an argument I said that to the earlier caller I Believe it's billions of years old\nBut if somebody says it's a few thousand years old they they don't bother me\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shots and measles shots theyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's I I don't it's not an argument is that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or in deep divide and that God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a a battle worth fighting over the literal midst of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd a A R title my work on the Bible the rational Bible and I try to be true to the title reason tells me that it's billions of years old\nIt is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years ... what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible itself says in ... a day in God's a ... a day in God's eyes just like three thousand is just like a thousand years\nOkay thank you my friend I really appreciate it means when semi Valley California you're the first man go I have ever spoken to\nWhat the pressure than\nMe I always ask people with unique means how did you get the main main do\nWell they actually Spanish for Domingo but you know\nA Sunday I'm speaking about incorrect Sunday either Sunday okay go ahead bingo\nI I was curious I have ... um I've known as the workers' comp and grab a manager and of course I grew up with catastrophic injury having trouble with people that I you know pick them\nUp for what am I but I never was nowadays everybody ... with them for everything\nThat was just wondering when that whole\nChange in the sixties and seventies when when\nA rejection of traditional American middle class ... wa Judeo Christian colon what you want values took place everything was up and the good stead of dividing the world between good and bad\nAmong all the animals and especially other primates those that produced memory glands ha a breast only humans only the female human\nHas breast all the time\nIncluding when they can't even get pregnant including when they're not nursing in in other animals the women get breast if they're if they're only\nBaby feeding machine says that tweet suggested then why why do women have press all the time\nOne of the reasons is they are sexually alluring and in the human species the female is the visual allure and peacocks it's the mail that's the way it works OK their argument is with nature not with men\nThere'll be a very sad day if the female press is not a sexual or very sad day the people who read psychiatrists of the people who send those tweets\nOkay it's not clear [noise]\nAh ah these people are bored ultimately for back in the moment the Dennis Springer show from the relief factor pain free\n\nRelief factor is made from a high quality fish oil and essential nutrients gives your body to help it needs to a fighting recurring aches and pains when life aches and pains get you down you need relief\nPhysicians made relief factor is an essential way to support the bodies fight against aches and pains it's so remarkable product is worked I only endorse it because it helped my wife with her knee pain I didn't even know she was taking\nThan when it was mentioned she said oh yeah the stuff is is like magic but there are people told me they postponed or delayed or simply ma gated surgery because of relief factor that's how powerful it does\nGo to W.

Ninety two\nYes that is true that I thought that was so we're coming up are pushing toward almost Thirty years\nOr in this job or tell me about the uh early balloting and you had said there were did I hear you say there were a twenty five thousand new folks are registering is that what I heard you say\nYes but I said there was twenty five thousand new citizens register between the the voter registration cut off the primary election 'til last week when we upload every Monday\nI'm so all keep keen and we keep change you know updating information going through our process as we normally do um what I said\nYou shouldn't going through our process we normally do\nUm what I said is a currently we have about five hundred and forty five thousand register voters in Pima County and growing\nAnd our first flowed out of balance that will be dropped in the mail on Wednesday the tent at the first day we can legally mail ballots\nIs about three hundred and Ninety thousand ballots we mail that the voters they'll they should be looking for a green envelope um make sure you read the directions follow 'em don't use felt pens because they bleep through on the ballot\nOr one of the other two questions and when they get the ballot is they say do I have to vote for every single race and the answer is no you don't you just vote for the races are the issues that you feel comfortable and knowledge on\nDoing um [noise] I I Know that\nAnd we're trying to do that the certainly in news stories you to push the voter registration deadline who's who's the that's not necessarily the deadline to ask for an early ballot the road\nOh no the deadline to request an early ballot is on the go get my election calendar you a death\nOr something like the Nineteen or something like that or even later\nI'm In is hold on one second\nIt's October twenty six moon even look at\nIt is the last day and you can go online and on my officer recorder dot humid dot Gov in do request on line or they can simply color office I'm at seven to for for three three zero\nA lot of times people will call us because they'll be temporarily way either I'm visiting their parents or a relative or travelling or whatever and they'll tell us where they want us to mail the ballot two of them will gladly mail the ballot\nThe other misconception is that people will have a their mail forwarded and think that their male will be forward in an election materials non for all it'll be kickback to us I'm and I'm so we kinda have to start begin chasing of these voters\nAre in and telling them to the ballot was returned to us and where did they want us to send their ballot test to them wherever they're temporary yeah\nSo one thing that a couple of friends move ... of course didn't kind of it the the you know to help them out and whoever else is in this situation if you're registered to vote to those who was Pima County would you move\nAfter the voter registration deadline before the election do what we should do go boat house goes through both should you do a cast it in the presumed you were registered in you know you can't change it can you\nYes we can keep doing them and that's what creates the provisional ballots on election day if people didn't update their address and they don't know where to go to we keep telling them yes they can keep updating their addresses or um or go to one of our early voting site we have eleven early voting sites um opened up\nOur three main recorders offices will open up on the tenth and then we've expanded that to um locations throughout the valley\nUm they just have to go again to my um website and look under early voting locations and it'll give you the names and uh the the addresses and the times that we're open\nWe have a location green valley Saturday the area we have north side the last week a before election where we we stop 'em\nMailing out ballots we've opened up for additional ...\nMost of them have been cooperation with the public libraries are so that people we can deviate them one is that the mission library\nMission and I hope the Miller golf links library the current mayor library and Pima County natural resources or so and we're also um I was the first quarter in this state that actually opened up early voting side of the university University of Arizona campus\nSo that some hubbub for it's like a mini city\nUm and so we have several locations out there and people can just look and we try to take care of those type of situations so they don't create a provisional ballot on election day we we divert those people to one of our early voting sites prior to election\nDay has long somebody's on the list by midnight on to do so if you're living in Tucson\nYou moved to Miranda at the end of the month you can still end up costing about and the boys but you end up living it correct because we just have to tell\nYou it but we like to divvy deviate those people to an early voting sites that they don't get stuck in a line of your location and that type of\nSituation right I Want a little bit of perspective here uh how has early voting really changed everything and by election day what percentage of registered voters probably already cast their ballot fan Rodriguez\nWell it depends on the election but overall in in the actual the amount of people that actually cast a ballot whether it's at an early voting side or by mail versus a polling location\n... it's about Seventy to Seventy five percent of the people who are actually voting are voting by either mail at our early voting site they're not even going to pull them location anymore\nSo that that's the wave and this is across the state of Arizona there are a few exceptions to a few counties\nWhich is probably Apache a Navajo county I'm there like a traditionalist they want to go to their polling location and and vote that way so um most people like I said are using their early voting process as to how to\nCast their ballot now\nAnd if someone was looking for a little extra money do do you still are you still hiring people to work at the polls\nWell that would be the department of elections I Can't answer that question because they're already going through some training to a\nTraining process like my office we finished hiring everyone because today we're training a well trained Monday different tasks like today\nToday where we are working with our early voting site people\nWe we had a tip this morning that Jeff Flake was seen flying um to Dallas and that from DC from DC so that seems to be in the wrong direction and yeah we have some questions it's still an unconfirmed report but we've reached out to the senators' offices both by email and phone to find\nOut if this is accurate because\nI did hear a little something that the Senate isn't taking the weekend of this where there were busy this weekend there's something going on and so this just doesn't seem like the the the right\nWe can to be how do I mean if I Would ... Senate votes and some are on Kavanaugh in DC is something you can phone in if Jeff Flake is flying in the wrong direction\nIt could be newsworthy and you can't vote or at the U.S Senate ... can you have to be there on the floor yeah wow in person\nNo proxies but he has said he's going to vote for Kavanaugh has any well he voted for ... ... so we don't know what happens next I mean you know today was about moving the vote for it and beginning debate\nI think there are some people that are holding their cards the vast and Jeff has really been great at keeping us all on this idea of our seats trying to figure out what is going to do next\nYou know hasn't really said one way or another this week whether he's a a thumbs up or thumbs down but even quotes that suggests both yeah at different times yeah well he did say\nI Believe the latest was that he would vote to confirm a judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court quote unless something big changes\nAlthough he said that before the report that not correct yeah so and there's a lot of what he makes of what's in that report and of course what he makes of the political pressures he's getting and what people are ah telling him but you know talking to him about\nAnd monitor the undecided was supposed to let us know I Believe uh the she was going to let everybody know this afternoon whether or not a shoe that with Susan Collins and re I don't see anything ... or the latest on that I don't think she has\nNo nothing nothing yet on that a lot of talk or some of this polling that's been coming out uh Joe Fergus and one of the polls showing in the governor's race\nThere are three vote there at three different polls out right now that puts David Garcia behind\nGovernor Doug do C and while what Paul can be bad or two polls can be bad we're getting into the numbers where you know you're seeing not just about Paul you're seeing some trends so I think given Garcia's got some numbers to make up it's a month away still but you know it doesn't look great right now\nIt's not outside the realm of possibility quite yet but the the the the trend has not been looking great for the Jones your and ready to leave that up on my screen there that the the polling\nShowing voice that spread is not real positive for for\nThe voice that spread is not real positive for for a for a\nDoctor Garcia some of those numbers look like one poll had it like I Do see out by Eighteen\nPercentage\nPoints but then again there's another one that is as close as four so I'm Still\nLeaning very much induces direction how about the U.S Senate race that's very ah certainly don't they say within the margin of error\nFor the most part all the polls I've seen him do please correct me if I'm wrong but I mean you get one politician cinemas ahead the next day good appalled if ... the head and it goes back and forth or just a number of polls out right now they're just essentially it bring it down to a flip a coin\nThan most of those goals are to be the point spread between a mix alliums intimate that's been within the margin of error of each one of those polls that basically they're saying ...\nWe had a Ann Kirkpatrick on the program yesterday and uh we do have Leah Marquez Peterson scheduled to be on the program next Thursday uh how is that race going right now a gentleman\nUgly when it's Joe says it's ugly ugly for um for Leah or what\nI think that there's back and forth going on there's now groups that have gotten into the race and put money out with the flyers attacking both sides on this I'm sure ads are just around the corner I'm I have heard whispers that the teacher will see us going to pull back on the amount of funding\nThey are going to put behind and Patrick and that could mean two things either they're very confident of their chances and see to or the money has to go somewhere else 'cause needed somewhere else\nAnd if it if you look over all the money picture you know I I hate to\nEvery time we look at a race just go straight to looking at the books and that way but uh\nIt it it it tells you something that this time around the amount of money that's been raised by the candidates in that race is nowhere near what we've seen in the past several election cycles where you know we've seen multi millions a pour it into the city too and we're just not seeing that this time around but did\nThe equation is is that Martha's missing from the component to she was up ... hundreds or for as long as she's been running in these races I noticed the Democrats poured in money on the other side right off the coast\nAnd so this time it's not a cheap election by any measure but it just doesn't have that component because she's\nApps and we're speaking of abs and your colleague our friend Tim stellar as an interesting column in today's Arizona Daily Star about Senator Jon Kyl who's kind of been I guess under the radar would be kind of a [noise]\nThere's a there's only said something there was a protest that Jay ... at ... office today the other is why there isn't one ... because they're really winded right [laughter] so uh\nSo he is or the caretaker he could take her the seat\nAnd many of the the seat warmer for ... some people are concerned because there's not a lot of confidence that he's going to be here in January\n... somebody else will be appointed that that seems to be what everybody's thinking whether that pans out that way will have to see that\nThat's where all all the signs point to him being a you know some somebody a temporarily put back into the Senate to pretty much specifically deal with the cabinet both agree that the Republicans worked a vote shy\nKen Bennett a has looking for his campaign his public campaign funds that's that's kind of um he says he's outta money you need the money badly\nDoes this isn't unusual we've always seen campaigns that have bills at the end of a cycle and even after they didn't win they'll reach out to supporters and ask for money\nTo help you know close accounts to help pay off consult and things of that nature of ... you know campaign running out of money is nothing new\nIf he's trying to get his clean elections funds which he\nThinks he qualified for and a lot of government officials say he did not qualify for so he's angling to get a more of the contributions that were made a added to the qualifying list\nAnd I think you he loaned him his campaign he himself wound is campaign pretty tidy a chunk of money and he's looking to get that paid back\nRay is she a re Allen's kind of monitoring senator Collins right now are on the floor and making a quite a long speech a and I guess she'll make her announcement at the conclusion of that speech that are so right now it's just\nBack and forth building this this building the suspense but as soon as we know here if it happens during ah during a the next couple of minutes we'll certainly uh let everybody know or you know this I I had no idea this is away from politics Dylan but it's kind of\nThe situation with all that the rain or I mean there were ... areas of the town of oil out of the nation that had seven inches of rain from the remnants of Rosa\n... western Arizona got hit a whole lot harder than we did hear the ...\nAnd I had no idea that that they had some of these um earthen dams on the nation that some of them are like over a hundred years old\nAnd you kind of think like uh maybe it's time or the bureau of Indian affairs or the government maybe takes a look at this situation and that\nKind of thing where you know sort of what he wants to spend any money on it because it's out of sight outta mind quite frequently and unfortunately and ah we did to have\nThe the risk of one of those names are being overtopped with so much rain and if that happens a basically it starts being washed away in the ... the entire damn can fail\nYeah I mean a thing as I say goes back a hundred years and um there's the people that were living downstream others that could have been a really horrible situation you can\nSee how dramatic it was I think it was my Christy from the star who took a really great aerial photo of really ...\nFor spending the time and the resources to really get that shot from above because just one shot from Mike Christie's photographs and you understand yeah how big and how men that problem really is\nNow but I just thought certainly worth bringing up and that was really a good good photograph of what's coming up in the paper on Saturday or Sunday anything you want to", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city":
