to talk to me but I Do appreciate your selling coming on today a film festival in full swing last night the the pitch events correct was it was happening in the desert pitch\nThe the pitch events correct was it was happening in the desert pitch how did that go\n... it went great we had a great uh we had a great time this is our second event that we've done the ... which basically in a nutshell is uh people uh submit ideas for a film or television shows and uh and then you we invites some some people that come in and do their pitches in person and then\nWe have a a panel of out of town kinda producers directors critics things like that and they narrow it down and then at the end of the night to somebody walks away with a thousand dollar check so it's kind of a fun thing to watch\nWho doesn't like that and and the experience and experiences obviously the main thing there of uh getting in that space and having the opportunity to pitch in and do all that stuff is a is definitely a learned skill or of overtime hitting\nIt is and I think that's one of the things I think is so great about it even if you don't have some pitch to watch how people hedge to listen to the judges and you know tell them feedback and then you realize oh\nYou know I mean this is not usually in a room pitching to professionals you know to get that far is pretty good so it's a great opportunity to come in and do that and so it was fun and we had a great winter and we were down at the AC Hotel in a nice to be there but yeah we're uh\nI'm calling you from the Scottish writes a cathedral right now and we're just finishing the set up of our of our for screening room here at the Scottish right 'cause we moved our outdoors screenings inside due to the weather and then we've got a things at the AC Hotel tonight also to their screening rooms\nAnd then Saturday we had the Fox theater for a special a couple of events on Saturday Night so we are going to be an seven screens this year which is about twice as much as last year so\nWell that's a that's more work and I appreciate you doing it so this is here three of the of a film festival by my understanding I mean by my recollection and and people can find all this just to make sure so they know film fest Tucson dot com full schedule there as they can get their tickets they can\nFind out what they're doing there is a helpful grid that lets you know what's happening everywhere all the time it's super well designed\nA but it feels like I mean you know ... this is a bigger\nCatherine Hardwick on on Saturday and\nThis is a a bigger it's an expansion of the of the vision of the festival at least to me\nIt is it is and I think um and you know ... we've known each other for a long time I've um you know I I restore the Fox theater so I'm kind of a film guy and for a while I was program in Napa Valley film festival which had about twelve different venues in four towns\nSo I'm I'm a I'm trying to be very conscientious about\nUh how uh how our team builds this festival and grows this festival and uh\nYou know certainly there's there's there are other festivals that happen here in town but what we're doing is just a little bit different and so we're ah we're excited about the way that the community has responded to this and and now we're going to continue to to expand in downtown and make this another fall classic much like a meat yourself for some of the things that have been around for a while this is that it's going to be\nThere's going to be kind of a thing that everybody looks forward to and hopefully is not only for for locals but leads to some some visits from out of town which is\nWhy you know for example like you mentioned the cancer and heart thing that we're doing she's doing a master class and of course she's a she was until recently the highest grossing female directors she directed Thirteen lords of dog pound the first twilight movies so she's an amazing action director\nUh but also were uh you know we're honoring her into actresses and then doing a screening of dark town but we\nWanted to ... if people have yeah I Know they need to go see dog town is so much fun\nAnd the director will be there this is the this is not a like a regular I Know too soon and I get it like you know sometimes it takes a little bit to get off the couch you know there's something on Netflix it's fine this is not a thing that happens all the time you can through hard work will be discussing her film at the Fox and it is how much her\nIt's free I mean there is literally no excuse not to be at the Fox on Saturday Night\nThere is you're right and and you know even if let's just say let's just say maybe you're not a skateboarding fan and I understand that um there's other great programming it all the other venues so for example I'm where I'm calling you from the Scottish right for the third year in a row we're doing a vintage a silent movie black and white silent movie\nA whiz live musical accompaniment and so a lot of folks know the great Jeff ... uh the piano player and a former you a teacher and jazz great\nHe is going to for the third year a company a film or this year it's hound mix is Nineteen twenty two films sky high which was filmed partially in the Grand Canyon so it's got a nice little Arizona connection and\nAnd Jeff is pounding away on a on a new score that he's written specifically for the film so he's going to be in her I worked in those down jacket three o'clock some super excited to see that but\nIf you've never seen a silent movie with live music I mean it's really transformative it's magical it's not that you know seven point one surrounded with speakers in the ceiling any of that stuff is is this is ... you know a live person playing along and responding to what's on the screen and it it's just it's magical it really is\nI one of my uh the highlights to me and this is the uniqueness is sort of thing right I mean they're obviously a lot of events and things to do I would say the a critic versus audience\nEvent with critical ... threat I if if you're a person who is passionate about film first of all Chris worries more passionate about it than you are and will be happy to tell you about it in the best possible way um you know with a topic including movie critics are idiots or it should be\nShould be exciting that said or one thirty tomorrow at these guys are a purple room or how how did this happen how did you get how does why is Chris ... coming\n[laughter] Chris is great so ... I had Chris up in Napa when I was when I was program in the Napa Valley folk festival so we met and we're also both members of the broadcast film critics which is kind of the big film critic association so I I always run into ... different things I think Chris I gotta get you to Tucson and he was like absolutely so we\nBack in back in January we lined up and and we uh it's funny we didn't actually settle on on the panel of that we're going to be discussing until probably about two months ago we got on the phone for a while and said\nWhat do we want to talk about what do we think is current and win what what's what's going to be fun and of course is one of our jurors last night for desert pitch and I think everybody that didn't know him fell in love with him right then because he is just such a great he's he's the he's just as great movie geek that is just witty and has such a grand he founded film threat which of course is just it's kind of great iconic\nA you know was was a magazine and it's all kinds of good stuff but it's just to have to have somebody like Chris in town and someone like Kathryn has just really kind of puts us on the map in terms of you know\n[noise] yes uh so the guardian had a piece or something on line today about a donation that somebody came into a ... office on friday to make a donation and there's a little bit of like it was from a ... organization you you have some any connections are even\nHigher ... I Am not familiar with the Arizona young communists um but I did spend seven years up in Flagstaff and if there was a communist group on the campus that wouldn't surprise me in the slightest bit sure it\nIt does happen and so they were I think as far as I could tell brought in a series of Nichols in a in a bag\nThere was a crumpled up five dollar bill I'm not entirely sure if it was a whole five dollar bill or just half of\nIt and then uh the oh Halloran you can watch this on YouTube on their YouTube page you'll Halloran campaign brought the money back\nTo the Republican offices in Flagstaff\nA ... it's all a mess but yeah apparently the the communist that organization is not seemingly not real you'll Halloran campaign is making the contention that it was actually people from the office for the Republican office in fact\n... ... ... always fine everything is always happening in politics the we don't have to actually talk about the issues as as they stand but he's insane or\nStay on donations stunned is happening uh speaking well on a wildly different now than he was looking at some of the uh the find work in the green valley news um how how was the breathing down there\nIn a well well we're not that there\nIs an issue so a free bad week for free ... background mining uh they put a solution on the mind tailings which which over\nA hover over a well today they do there hover over green valley and uh that's solutions supposed to keep the mine dust down and it apparently was diluted by rain and on Saturday there was a lot of wind and a lot of what looks like we're having a snow storm\nA and then it kicked up again yesterday with gusts of up to twenty five miles per hour this has gotten into lungs it's gotten into home so it's a free port is the ... the air or they're stepping up they are cleaning up there's a lot of cleaning up going on\nToday and uh it's one of those things that happens when you live close to a mind the last really bad one was four or five years ago and it was the circle mine which is just outside of a surreal\nAnd it uh it was a beautiful day people have their windows open and the ... came up and there was a big crack in the mind tailings and\nIt all ended up in in houses so are they at that time flew in an expert from Seattle who handle all the clean up they handled the um all the costs for it and paid a couple of hefty fine\nSo uh we're in that situation again it's a it's a tremendous mess the rain hopefully is is keeping things down today but\nThis mess the rain hopefully is is keeping things down today but uh yesterday was was quite the show in in the air in green valley\nAnd I mean you know it's it's there is an element of while they're going to you know tamper down to the dust and the feelings and things like that I mean this is getting\nI saw some of the quotes in the interviews are happening in the in the green valley you know the news is getting in people's houses I mean it is you know yeah you're ... you're having people with you know\nMaybe limited resources to clean these things or some\nYeah and that's why free ports going to step in there and we were taught to one person who are free ports got power wash outside of the house they are going to a professional clean the carpets all of the furniture and every everything inside the house\nThat's how bad it is but again this is such a small particles that if it gets into your lungs it's really really bad news so again they're stepping up\nAnd the the the mind doesn't actually say this but the truth is that the mine was here first than mine was here before green valley was and therefore you move in kind and knowing what the score is doesn't make it right doesn't really even making understandable because it's simply shouldn't be happening\nBut it does it does kind of give them one of these little advantages like eh you didn't have to live here so that\nThat feels like some ... no no no\nNo no not this week well I thought I mean\nYou know obviously the ... there's a million races going on from governor all the way down I thought this this was my possibly fun idea I wanted to say I have to ask her steam to guess what is that what's that under covered\nWell it's a little facetious the undercover people covering them but still what does that raise that you don't think people are necessarily paying enough attention to\nIt that's that's out there Joe Joe uh what what's something that people maybe should pay more attention to\nYou know I think that there's a a really big race coming up to now only ten down the house side I think that Democrats are putting all of their resources into getting um the Republican who's in office right now out\nAnd there's just a lot of back and forth on that and so this is probably one of the only districts that I can think of locally in southern Arizona that could flip where we're going to have a Republican or you know possibly voted out which we'll see what happens in the coming weeks but\nIt's just something that's kind of flown under the radar I Know that there's a lot of back and forth um there was a recent article that Hank\nStephenson and I wrote and so but you know generally speaking to some people talking about the race and\nTen is Todd ... yeah that is my district full disclosure I got a a a delightful moustache a flyer from Todd uh yesterday was promoting his moustache I think as as best I can understand it and and taught had what could be charitable you described as a\nControversial year I think I mean there are there was ... for most most state legislatures supplied largely under the radar taught had some not so much under the radar moments\nSo the assault weapon the Confederate flag or ... when we talk\nAbout I was going to leave the third off about that but yeah he there was an incident where he had what was the Confederate flag wanted was\nIt was on his computer as his background picture and that upset a lawmaker who complained about it and then we got all of us got to hear about it from there\nWell these these things do happen and who are the ones who and who's the Democratic opponent of the rings I should know because it's your race I Know I I used to I used to be involved in politics uh but I I I'm a political now so I I just I just pick things off the mail\nAnd and then by the way we can't leave that third one of the ticket [laughter] 'cause actually Madison thing speaks to integrity the man who was married who made a vow to a woman and is screwing around apparently on the side he says are allegedly actually tipping followed through but he is on a website and he says\nHis wife is a not a meeting his needs and a certain area this is um this is a huge integrity issue and it's up to the voters of course to decide whether it's enough to dump them uh but but he says you know it's my sex life as private no it isn't no it isn't when you have publicly made a vow to to a person\nAnd then you are doing this and what ... what are the barest meant for her and a shame\nTo him and then he comes out with that type of response and and I think I think twice before pulling the lever in his favor\nAnd and so this is the one thing I and you did some reporting on this as well like where did how did how did that news come out even\nWhile we have a you know tools that the Daily Star that help us keep a tab on\nThe seven hundred races that we cover and so um something went online they had all this information about Kleinfeld there it was anonymous they went to great lengths to hide who they were but you know he's been into a couple of high profile fight slavery with\nBoth Democrats and Republicans and so you know there are small group of a ... gallery of people who could have done it\nAnd we went from there to the dark nets assay Madison and ... you know spends a good couple of hours verifying the information before Todd you know came clean it emitted that the information was that was true\nYeah and and that we should also point out that this is the season where people are throwing information that the reporters all the time trying to get their opponents in trouble for and some some of it as a write on a lot of it's complete bologna and the started exactly the right thing by checking it out and then going or\nTo Todd and asking him about it and so there's a lot of things you'd love to run with but you get into a lot of trouble because it's it's not accurate but trust me\nOr the campaign is vicious I shifts\nThat run I mean I Will say as you know you you get into journalism at least you know because of a curiosity or you know and also the public service aspect of it maybe but uh\nThat time period of getting those emails like ... and I I even at the weekly we got stuff that we couldn't verify or we can run with\nIf you enjoy like the soap opera aspect of this stuff this is a really spectacular season the catch is is these people are making decisions affect all of our lives as well so it's it's such a weird balance of like\nA yes a lawmaker on actually Madison a and also lawmaker who decides our schools are run you\nKnow and you and you know people who claim that we have no standards in journalism should see the garbage that doesn't get an end to print it's far more interesting but it's probably a certainly not verifiable and it's probably not accurate but if we were lesser people it would be in there because it would certainly sell newspapers but we would never do it because we do have standard\nSee there you go that's good that's always a plus dandy you have a a favorite least favorite race or something", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "12"}
