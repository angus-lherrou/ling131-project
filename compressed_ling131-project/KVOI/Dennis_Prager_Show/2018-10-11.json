Tucson Hispanic Chamber of commerce\nAnd Republican candidate for Congress in the second congressional district is where the sun ally blindly or how are you\nGood bill how're you doing real well ah what is your reaction to this news today about the national Republican congressional committee deciding to cut back on their TV spending and your campaign\nYou know what it is disappointing but independent groups can make their own decisions ah the polling is still very close so what I'm doing is continue to focus on speaking the voters throughout the district um\nYou know like I've got a lot of momentum from the debate we had earlier this week a lot of positive notes and create messages from the community which I so appreciate it so I'm not really focused on what the outside groups are doing I'm just going to continue to focus on CD too in southern Arizona and take this race to the when\nWhat do you think the message was that came out as a televised debate you know I\nI Hope what people saw there was that I Am a local candidate I'm not\nLike and someone who's come from the outside move from five six hours north to try to represent us there's also been so much hypocrisy bill in this race\nI'm Crazy mailers and sent out I mentioned during the debate that uh she claimed and stated that I had taken let them fifty thousand dollars and special interest group money when she's taking more than three million during her political career if they're putting out a crazy male or on me about that\nUm I also said it in the debate that she told Jonathan pay when she ran against him in the Flagstaff area that\nPeople needed a lifetime of service to represent a district yet now she's doing the same down here moving into our community to try to represent when I had a lifetime of service working throughout southern Arizona\nSo I really hope that people in this debate realized I'm just that the stark contrast between our positions on issues and realize that I'm a local candidate so involved in the community really loving and caring for southern Arizona well she's just moving in here for another political feet to get herself back to D.C\nWhat about clarifying your position on Social Security\nAnd I'm Glad you brought that up because I think it's a very typical scare tactic\nAnd their mailers going out that I'm eliminating Social Security and Medicare which is ridiculous my own parents or on Social Security and Medicare it's a very typical democratic attack at what I said it in that debate was that I'm going to fight to keep the promises made and keep those programs in place\nUm so there's absolutely no truth to that\nOr would you also like to come to clarify your position you've taken some heat for not a answering the question do you believe in climate change I think people were looking for a yes or no answer from you on that\nYeah you know when that came up in the debate with\nWhat I said it I think we all we need to be good stewards of our environment and we need to strike a strong balance which is what I spoke about at the debate between protecting our environmental resources like our deserts our forests and so on\nBut not hinder our economy for working families and others um I support alternative energy solar wind and nuclear and I think we need to move away from fossil fuels and that's certainly a a good thing but it needs to me market driven and not from government mandates that race energy costs some people\nThat have fixed incomes are on the poor\nBut regardless of whether the reasons may not be exactly clear about the climate changing would you agree that there is\nThe climate or there is change happening with our climate\nOh certainly I think that's pretty common sense\nWhat about the an issue that came up during

actually one of four states I Know a nationally where we can clip the fate from Democrat to Republican there are a couple and Minnesota what in Nevada\nAnd then this one here in Arizona\nWhat is the issue the the separate you from congressman o'halleran\nWell there are a lot of issues that may from Congress mental Halloran uh the latest one is endorsements um I was endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio and as a a complete contract to that a congressman oh Halloran was endorsed by it out of state\nLiberal a socialist congressman or Justice Kennedy so that went out on my email today as kind of a stark contrast in uh the types of folks who are supporting us but really bill\nWas it a campaign that selection comes down to the fact that we do where do we not want it for lots of good news and prosperity started under the Trump Administration or a regret back to the way things were for example you know if I just read a couple of headlines\nGets from the past a lesser so\nSmall business optimism\nOr

economic potential\nI Am running to continue\nThe conservative pro American job policies of President Trump I Can't hear it that control the house of representatives said come down to one seat I mean we have the Supreme Court we had the Senate we have the president say if we lose control\nOf the house of representatives to invisible Tom O'Halleran and Nancy Pelosi all of the progress we've made will stop cold in its tracks I mean they had said that they will impeach the president\nTax cuts would be overturned and forget about a walk and border security funny even in our own state right there in uh southern Arizona liberal Democrats on the Pima County board of supervisors just\nRejected millions of dollars in a border security funding for Arizona border which was completely irresponsible uh there's liberal has\nTrump arrangement syndrome that play politics with the safety of our of our communities will families when we take the seat back so I Will go to Congress to fight that means supporting President Trump that means building the wall repealing Obamacare securing the border\nGetting more tax cuts protecting Social Security or protecting our guns\nVoting for term limits and making darn sure that my fellow veterans get the care that they deserve and they these aren't talking points these are my these comprise my checklist on a pilot I operate checklist and I keep a list\nWhat about is this are contending that just congressman Halloran is just too liberal for the CD CD one district\nThat is correct a\nAnd in this district such diversity or from the suburbs of the Tucson area all the way up to almost a Utah border or are you a better fit than than Tom O'Halleran ... what I'm hearing\nI Love that question absolutely I have conducted over fifty five rallies\nAll over the districts like light Cessna one eighty to\nA throughout the district we just got back uh two days ago from uh having been to Stafford rent see we started down in oral valley Illinois uh flew out to Springer bill that events there and then I ended up to ... and then flew back\nA that was just one example of all of the visit that I'd made an overwhelmingly\nA these are the the small towns and cities\nThat are normally a flyover areas that are never visited\nAnd they tell me time and time again no congressman a congresswoman a list of all congressional candidate has ever visited and I go and we talk and I listen and I take notes and I stay for a meal and the crowd that had been coming out has been\nDone it uh we get anywhere for thirty ... eighty\nPeople at every one of my head that\nAnd they talk while towns honor that fact that you show up especially up on the Navajo Nation\nWhere I had visited many many times and what resonates there are two of ... namely that I'm a veteran and that I'm a grandmother and that is a essential a part of their culture\nAs most of your listeners may know we're talking about the Navajo Nation which has a different time zone a different language and culture all onto its own however uh Seventy percent\nOf the Navajo Nation went to World War two\nNine of the code talkers are still alive and uh grandmothers essentially ruled the roost so and grandmothers they vote for Wendy they vote for Wendy and that's because I've been to so many chapter house meetings and that was so many folks up their way before I Won the primary\nI was up there a earlier this year and had been up there are many many times flying airplane there and to window Iraq into cancer and other areas so this is a district that is a great fit for someone like me to represent someone who has served her country\nOr for Twenty years as one of the very first women pilots in the air force has raised a family is still needs payroll as a small business owner I just came from a small business meeting here for my business ten minutes ago and uh uh the these these are the kinds of\nPersonality traits and characteristics that I had that are a great fit for this
