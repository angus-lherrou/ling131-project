argument for less of that that I Know that so shocked you cause you understand how this think\nYeah and I understand if it's not you know worth alienating family members so I I think you were right to

time feels a lot different in your long career you've seen some of these uh these divisions but uh well unfortunately I'd is the case isn't it\nYeah I Would like to say this is unique but it is it um if you really want to talk about division\nOr I'd go back to the year Nineteen sixty eight when we had the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther king and it's set our cities on fire snipers shooting randomly it passing cars at Washington machine gun ness guarding the Capitol building\nHad one moment in time when you had the convergence and simultaneous explosion of the civil rights movement in the anti war movement and here in Washington\nA weird curfews military law and tanks and the streets\nAnd you can imagine a if this had happened nowadays what social media\nAnd the twenty four hour news cycle would have done with this because he was really it was dangerous times I mean the the there was an element with the with the underground the in the ... the resistance and the Vietnam War where you had bombings going on across the country uh he was a it was a dangerous time\nAnd I'm sure it affected you personally\nOh yeah everyone was I mean I remember very well and it I just had our first child Michael and he was just a just out of the hospital almost in we lived in an apartment Georgetown above the liquor store\nThe police told us to get\nThe heck out of there and uh so\nLuckily I had a cousin who lived across town at our house so we abandoned ship and went over there only to find him sitting in his basement while all the lights off with a three fifty seven ...\n[laughter] I mean those that's working late late yeah terrible\nIt really is yeah and the thing I guess a and it wasn't unique to DC I ours in Chicago or at that time and and things were the cities were burning weren't they\nThere's been all sorts of ah opinions on this including a an op ed in the New York times today saying a revised North American trade agreements undermines investors certain\nWell you know the failing New York times um so so there are as many opinions about this a rewrite of NAFTA has there are people who may have them uh I think that Terry was correct in characterizing the\nEach of the huge pieces of this deal a little bit differently a with a different winners and losers for jogging about dairy yeah so the the the Canadians have\nHistorically taken steps to protect their dairy farmers are they they continue to have a higher percentage of their population in rural and inform areas than we do and it's it's a politically powerful lobby for them\nAnd they have produced some plans that protect\nThe dairy farmers in Canada from from ... river from him where it's from the United states and elsewhere uh\nIt it was time that in renegotiating NAFTA that we kind of broke into that a little bit and we've we've broken into it in the tiniest way we can import two percent\nOf cheese products out of the United states into into account the two percent of their production\nIs the limit the set by the new the new deal so the doors literally lightly crack open and and you don't you don't know of course you know wants to do that opens up whether they'll figure out other ways to accommodate a their surplus a production and ours is well\nThere's also this weird kind of thing that goes along with that we're in stores or where the Canadians we're only\nPut wind are produced in Canada on certain shows now has to be shared with him or did mine\nFrom from the United states so there's some things that you know quite frankly if challenged in court might not might not even hold up because it seems to me that they're interfering in some of the rights of a private business owners nevertheless ah this is\nOver\nOverdue rewriting of NAFTA most of the analysis that I've been reading about it a stage that there's nothing really radical in here are the biggest change that appears of\nCures and you know and it's it's not just like a thousand pages of of agreement but there's also the side letters that that define a trace the history of the negotiation undefined having to go she Asian on a particular issue came out\n[noise] but is the idea of how we're going to be treating a order manufacturers and imports of uh\nOf autos and at what point are the components of an automobile I have to have been made by a laborers who make at least Fifteen dollars an hour in order to be exempt from tariffs\nAid or by uh laborers who make at least Fifteen dollars an hour in order to be exempt from tariffs are so it it it gets to be you know fairly arcane but but the\nThing that I'm fairly certain of is that this is not a revolutionary deal it is more of the same which was good for the United states Mexico and Canada all along or this will probably continue to be pretty good\nUh one of the reasons the the Dow was up is because several large component of the doubt I have done well in this deal\nOh the drug companies big pharma has done well because quite frankly the intellectual rights and the patent rights of these uh drug companies are going to be a protected\nUh in in Canada as they are in the United states for a longer period of time so to the extent that people were going to Canada to get the same drugs that are prescribed in the U.S\nFor a lesser amount of money because they're out of patents or in a in Canada that will be somewhat reduced or as a result those people will be paying more for their drugs\nWill be paying more for cars or will be paying more for a ... if if the market expands would probably be paying more for cheese and in some other other products a as a result\nThe net net\nResult of this deal if\nThe pundits are to be taken seriously is that\nThe American public will be paying higher prices to this will be essentially attacks on the American public\nWhile the largest corporations manufacturers you are an auto manufacturers certain parts manufacturers and to a certain extent the agricultural community or will be doing better so uh you know so why does it I'm not saying this is a form of populism I just don't\nGet so why are some of these writers saying it's not good for investors\n[noise] well I Can't I Can't tell you that and I I think I think the problem read their siting\nIs that first of all there's a sixteen years son said on this deal and there are ways of modifying the deal that had been precluded under NAFTA\nSo that we're again and we've spoken about this so many times what investors are looking for is a degree of stability and certainty with this does is it throws a an institutionalized\nElement of uncertainty into the into the into the mix included in this by the way we are not included in this is a commitment on the part of the United states\nTo drop the tariffs that were imposed by the Trump Administration on steel and aluminum that still to be negotiated so we don't know where that is so there's there's a great deal of uncertainty there if I understand you have Keith around later on in the\n... were from Mexico contributors and he'll talk to can shape yeah he'll\nHe'll talk about the effects in Mexico but but the dispute resolution aspects of NAFTA we maintained in this deal and but only for Canada\nUm they're dropped for the Mexicans and disputes now have to be resolved by the uh local jurisdictions the court systems in in both countries that provides an element of\nLocalized uncertainty that could really be a upsetting to markets and I think that might be one of the reasons why are some investor or groups are saying we we just don't think that this is as stable or an agreement as it as it could\nBe you'd mentioned wine and and\nWe've spent quite a bit of time as you know Shelley up in British Columbia
