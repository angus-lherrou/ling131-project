totally open with you about\nWhen things are related I have professors from all over the place or you just happens to have written an important book and he's a lot of fun Bradley ...\nThe book is in defense of Andrew Jackson but since I mentioned that you should go to ... for Hillsdale and that's where you'll learn about this remarkable college and not asking for money they just want you to know about their courses and about in prime is in about their students and so on ... for Hillsdale\nAnyway back to you professor and we're talking about his book in defense of Andrew Jackson\nSee we're we're not allowed any longer and this is I lay totally at the feet of the left we're not allowed to have any moral nuances it's everybody basically who live there for us\nUh in various states of sin and the less today is the purest of the humans that has ever left that is really how they look at themselves I promise you folks I'm not in any way exaggerating\nAnd so all of these ... the founders were were were worthless because they had slaves and uh you just go down the roster buddy the\nBut uh you just go down the roster\nBuddy ... the the Indian issue was a very very complex one and there were there were terrible things don't Indians indeed some terrible things to others including blacks who may enslaved including other Indian two million slaves and torture was for some tribes routine\nSo it's so they do is no easy answer to this problem\nAndrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in fighting a Indians and ah he adopted an Indian child now so I just reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making were should move on\nYou know actually things done it so that I Would love to jump right back in the court yes\nWas and of course I I understand ready to go commercial but the point I wanted to make with that at the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people that really really went after him for being and they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indians and for the east to west sure why people thought why is Jackson spending money of white\nPeople so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no war all knew what the certainly the west doesn't have the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried without question was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate of birth rate\nThat they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding the populated area so removal of the western territories was way to actually protect the Indian cultures at least if he thought that the again the execution of it was horrible but here's intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important book now you don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all know and it's true that Jefferson was incredibly violent man there's just no way around that I in every way was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians in white\nGet a deep respect strangely enough or beautifully enough he had a strange interesting respected women are buried deep respect to the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again in ... women as well as black one white were\nVery very well but the other thing I found about it so he's got his violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found Dennis and counter so many current politicians the guy was just unbelievably artist in everything he did\nAnd I think it would have killed his soul she would have done something that would have been misleading or decides that that's how much of a stickler was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity really quite stunning\nWhy

you can't broadcast and I I don't mean mean over the radio just to others in general but\nIt was very interesting and it's it's apropos of the baking Kelly thing and more in our society so that a pastor called earlier I was a wonderful man from I Believe was Cleveland\nOr Columbus ohio but I remember\nAnd\nHe was calling in about the importance of religious people voting specifically in his case Christians but he began unbeknownst to meet a lot during my commentary on the Bible the rational Bible and said I Hope it I think some things have effect I Hope it's okay with you or if it doesn't offend you in any way\nFor me to say it is it is a great Christian work of Bible commentary of scholarship and it was very sweet thing for him to say but\nThat I'm Jewish why would I be offended if a Christian were to say\nThat my commentary which is meant to be universal it's meant to be for Jews Christians atheists Buddhist Muslims agnostics ... anybody\nIt's kind of makes sense to everybody or it doesn't make sense but why would I be offended for a Christian to say to great if that's the greatest compliment I can get from a Christian is it's a great Christian commentary\nBut she the pastor's being was being very sensitive and to his great credit but there's also a function of our time\nAnd the Megan Kelly situation while obviously very very different is related in my

job you guys are doing\nBack your grades go ahead Ramona are a quick comment and then we're going to talk about rote well\nGreg ... thank you for for your comments and and I would agree with you I I'm In one of the things that are that when I was in Arizona three sixty I mentioned there was a document that established in ... rights and didn't really say anything about where you're from us we might be familiar with it I think it was called the declaration of independence\nA and it was a written by immigrants and asylum seekers and we forget that that's a that's the route of four would come from a now ... obviously understand the need for security but understand also that are basis are roots and our greatness comes from our diversity\nA yes on prop for three is the best route to safeguard safer roads and economic progress back to the op ed in today's\nAh Arizona Daily Star a recently retired uh Priscilla corny Leo and I believe her predecessor John Burr now at the Pima County a department of transportation so we've got to\nA former top officials of the Pima County Transportation Department saying this is really a ... important here on roads\nAre absolutely built um eh for sixty three is a the most recent attempt to try him really do something on our roads\nAre obviously it is a ... it's going to be a solution to part of the problem and that's the incentive is to just a start getting a U.S going in the right direction we're looking at an eight hundred million to a billion dollar problem this is a four hundred and thirty million dollar five year bond\nOr so it's it's meant to to get us a ... way down the road a and obviously whether the the final mechanism is through some of the funding mechanism or through the next art TA to continue moving forward and getting our roads in a place where we really need to be\nA when people are coming to this community and companies and and uh sites electors are they notice our roads or an unfortunate does it does make a negative impact in and frankly\nI it it it uh in two thousand and six when we adopted the original art da ... wasn't a it was an issue that came up throughout over two hundred and fifty public meetings\nUm but today a we'd be hard pressed to walk into any coffee shop and and not hear the issue hey when are we gonna fix I wrote\nA which is why we title for the the campaign for six three just fix our our roads or it's something we need to do it as a priority for us as a community ah but we need people to go out and vote on November sex and the vote in favor of it\nAnd those that are not in favor of it says say we cannot trust Pima County\n[noise] well you know that's a that's easy to say I'm I Will tell you a and I I\nKeep reminding people as it looked the auditor general of the state of Arizona that works\nFor a GOP controlled legislature okay let me say that again the auditor general who works for the GOP controlled legislature\nCame in and audited our bond program what is it what did he find her she uh she she found a that it was transparent\nIt was accountable it are brought in all the other community it's not just a Pima County ... unincorporated areas she said not only was it on the up and up and praised us for it she said that other communities that are considering bond programs need to model after the Pima County bond program\nSo yeah you can say it\nBut look this is somebody who is naturally not necessarily a friend that Pima County Hussein now this is a model program\nA and it is not somebody that works for us works for the GOP controlled legislature\nAnd what can you tell our listeners to assure them that this will be monitored if past\nI've kind of oversight Oh absolutely um what what ends up happening in a bi ordinance and has and ... as part of the reason we won the praise from the auditor general is we have a open transparent citizen driven\nProcess with uh for the oversight over expenditures in the a bond program itself\nA so that any anything that gets done goes and and is overseen by not only the board by a separate citizens committee and it's done in public in open session and uh to to do most things takes\nA series of of two or sometimes four and five me public meetings\nSo it is very transparent is meant to be an engineer to be that way and if you even go and take a look at our ... our Web sites are on the previous bomb programs\nOr look there's just a wealth of information on where it was expanded a and that is a tradition that we have is a county and we will continue to do that and expand it if if there's if there's information that that are that are going to just don't see that they like to see their than just let us know will make sure it's there\nAre we we we actually pride ourselves on trying to get as much information to our constituency as we can [noise]\nAnd the what roads will be fixed\nOr at this point uh yeah the [noise]\nThe transportation advisory committee is going to meet I Believe the week after the election assuming\nA a with a with a sport of the voters are our community or that it passed a that discussion about where those four hundred and thirty million are going to be spent\nOr will be taken out but it's also a on our website has a memo that that already breaks it down\nUm because it's a little bit of a hybrid formula between population Annette assessed value um between the Pima County and the jurisdictions in our region so we've already got exactly how much is going to be spent a or not exactly approximately what's going to be spent inches jurisdictions as well\nThis ... you know we have a legal process and I think that all of the people coming to our country need to come here legally\nWhat about state issues or what's the most important thing right now on your agenda\nWell I have three things that are important number one is an education system that puts our children's academic success first I also building a stronger economy particularly down here in southern Arizona\nAnd out of the fun was financial accountability the taxpayers want to know where their funds are going and what are the results that were actually getting because that's not really becoming clear\nDo you think that ah there's just not enough communication across the aisle of between southern Arizona and the rest of what they call the great state of Maricopa\n[laughter] that type of um I just you know America hope is growing yeah why isn't Pima County growing or coaches county or the other counties that are surrounding a share why aren't they grow in Santa Cruz county um so we really need to take a hard look\nAt what um we can do here locally so that we can grow and thrive and create a stronger a tax base so that we don't have to raise taxes I consistently here so we need we need more money we need more money\nWe have a problem here but no one has defined what the problem is and when they if we can get to defining the problem then we really need to take a hard look at what moneys that we do have\nA conduct the gap analysis on what we need to do to move forward and make sure that we have a targeted approach on how we send our scarce resources\nThe education so called red for ed movement how do you feel about that\nWell I fully support a racist for our teachers I just want the races to go to our teachers\nAnd as far as changing the way of we have our education system right now would you like to see some changes right away\nYes I Would go ahead tell us well we were looking at some of the school districts that are performing phenomenally well\nAnd there are kids they're getting a great education\nUm well look at the other schools that may not have that kind of performance and we need to see what are they doing that they should be doing and what can they do differently so that our children can succeed academic you know from an academic a high standards\nUm I look at our children to there are some ... we have a great Jay Ted's program\nBut you know many people I talked to say we need vocational training back in the high schools our children need life skills ah I Know I'm a product of a vocational I'm\nA background in high
