what New York Times columnist or Don and Jim calls the complete national disgrace is over\nA Mr Brooks David Brooks thought the whole thing was the absolute disaster he concluded his column by saying the Kavanaugh hearings where to look into the mirror and vivid display of how ugly things have become what are we going to do about a gentleman what are we going to do about it anything\n... done what do you say well I I\nIt's proven that are in the country is more divided than ever\nAnd that the sad fact of that is usually you look toward a leader to bring the country back for president seeking to unite folks we don't have that we have a president who's not calling for unity continuing\nTo employ kind of a divide and conquer strategy that has now been adopted by the Republicans in Congress who are no longer interested in governance but in ruling\nAnd so that's pretty much what we have is one party rule uh you know no longer the checks and balances that you would expect and that's what we saw played out was kind of tribal divisions within Congress so I think the only solution comes again in\nNovember ... either see a an affirmation or confirmation of that if the Republicans maintain the majority in both houses or repudiation of it and a desire to return to checks and balances if the Democrats prevail\nGym the head of the Republican Party says the springs are all while on pretty darn tight right now that people are not going to calm down after this\nI think he's right uh I Will say this though ... you you seem to think that it's as divide and conquer it I think what this did more than anything\nI don't think that the river is going to be a referendum on President Trump um I think what it has become because of the horrible behavior of the Democratic party throughout the

listening to the great places to stay and several dozen recreational opportunities in silver city in\n... county New Mexico are to face off panelists today Jim Kelly and ... and during the break down you were telling me about silver city you love that area of southwest New Mexico\nIt's wonderful but if you if you're trying to get through there on the fourth of July\nDon't bother I I had to do some work their prices work and I was ready to leave on the fourth of July and both of the main roads were closed for the fourth of July the parade or that went in a loop and then did the loop again [laughter] so it was wonderful small town for eight and a great people but\nYou know enjoy your time there because you'll have some do and I are generally been over there as well yeah yeah of graveyards and\nOf the southwestern United States so as we concluded segment one uh Jim was talking about the bump that he expects Republicans to get\nA ... organization or what do you think are Democrats in trouble because of this is the enthusiasm still there as we get ready to a vote\nIt's been an interesting dynamic I over the past Seventy two hours or what we heard from Democrats in particularly democratic women\nAre over the past two days was real depression kind of a sense that uh oh why keep fighting you know we're losing everything the Republicans are are in control a now with Kavanaugh and Trump saying whatever he wants and they were his rallies and such\nAnd that changed then Sunday night and even toward today where it seems as though there was a temporary depression and right back to the\nA level of\nAnger for some excitement anxious miss\nAnd ... and right back to the a level of\nAnger for some excitement anxious and that is\nA really a determination now to get out there so I don't think it has hurt democratic turnout I think it'll actually again increase it because I think what will see Jim might've mentioned this earlier you're not going to have too many undecideds or by the time of selection which you will have\nA is again and particularly on the Democratic side record turnout from mid term election we're seeing that in terms of registrations in Arizona we saw record turnout and Pima County uh during the primary\nAnd we'll see that again and that's the difference from mid term Republicans do much better job of getting the voters out in mid terms and so the bump that that they may get is smaller in comparison to the huge bomb that you'll see with Democrats and in swing\nRaces that can make a huge difference and we have a number of those in this state this year\nYeah we were talking with Afghan Rodriguez gym on friday of course by the way the deadline to register as right right around the corner I think is yes tomorrow and uh she was talking about really that turn out in the primary uh was pretty amazing right I mean a lot of people still\nDecide for whatever reason they're not going to take part in the primary process but we did have enthusiasm a renewed enthusiasm about this primary\nBoy I absolutely agree with you I particularly in ... county is is the blue boy oasis for the Democratic party\nAnd uh yeah it's going to be tougher Republicans are impeding the county\nBut you know for for the the big boat that you guys the Democratic registration gotten Pima County\nUm it didn't get that big bubble up in America Kobe didn't get that big bump up it in in Coconino or you have a pie or a or Navajo you\nI'm so that we are going to be held Martha ... well ... and the Senate raised more the I think is going to be doing very very well I think the neck and neck as as we are Marquez and and and ... Patrick\nI'm ... and that's that was the the thing that the Democrats counted on they put a lot of money a dagger Patrick which also\nPlayed out in the voter registration drives the Democratic party in Pima County because they want this seat and they want it very very badly um\nBecause of that and because of that as you do those resources have been so concentrated in the ... county and city to\nIt has robbed other democratic candidates throughout the state and like I said I I just think there's going to there's not going to be a blue wave I think there will be you know a blue stream that continues in in a in a county\nUm but it's going to be a hard fight for live our cars and uh and and for average Patrick the city too is going to be a hard hard fight\nBut like I said I think the Democrats abandoned other candidacies in order to put all of their money into this blue trickle in a Pima County\nAnd and real clear politics thank you re for putting that up\nA looking like a cinema\n[noise] it's a ... you know it's about three point lead for cinema that's kind of in a margin of error I think that that is closed a little bit over the last couple of days so ... has a gotten that Republican bumped that we're talking about of\nThe\nUh\nThe reverse is is pretty much true from what we're watching a yes or all these rates are going to be contest but we've actually uh have seen and I and I think well we'll see in November is that in Kirkpatrick will win that seat by\nA larger percentage than our Kirsten Sinema may went in and she is leading by three percent that's run pretty steady so it hasn't really shown much of a difference it's always been between\nThree four percent or in the past couple of months and that's run consistently there are with regard to state wide registration again it's about four to one\nA difference in favor of Democrats in terms of toes now the total registration the state is still primarily Republican followed by independence smothered by Democrats about thirty three\nThirty to thirty one which is a close or\nGet at Penn it's been gaining in that area they have and that that's\nAnd that's what everybody's fighting route particularly in this angered Patrick and the ... they're they're ... they're fighting for the independence\nAnd that's what they're doing the same thing in in Pima County that the Democrats are doing statewide is focusing on the independence because they need them Democrats need two thirds of the independent to vote to to vote for Kirsten Sinema in order to win the votes and they're not going to get it hot\nWell that's that's what's up for question out because the getting back to the Kavanaugh nomination why does has done is again\nEnergized a women and you have a lot of angry women out there who are now more determined to vote\nYou also have a lot of angry quiet women when you're talking about the silent majority there's a silent component of women in independence and and even some Republicans who are very pleased with what they've seen with this\nTilt to the far right is a\nKind of complete dismissal of women's voices on the right\nAnd will not come out and speak to polls about 'cause then they're going to vote for butter indicating that uh women candidates have a much uh improved chance of winning in November and we're talking about a democratic or progressive female candidates Seventy\nPercent of the votes will be already in by election day believe that's what a ... Rodriguez said something like Seventy seven out of ten voters will have done the early ballot or absolutely how that has changed over the years\nI Know in my Thirty years in town or you know Thirty years ago even twenty five years ago I didn't even know if we had early balloting I mean it's just so we did and it was only it was called absentee ballot yeah yeah that would be here you had to demonstrate their sense of\nAnd or you owed them money and you need to pay and so we're really just trying to do a big warning because it's really hitting our credit unions hard\nAnd ultimately you know there's not much you can do if you're paying with your debit [laughter] yeah I mean you know it's going to take a long time for to get that money back if you can so you really just want to be careful again don't engage go directly to the bank and ask them\nAnd you know or give them a call directly on the number on the back of your car just don't engage with whoever you know reaching out to you because more than likely it's a scam\nOr the fraud check research study was very interesting what were the what were the bottom line conclusions of that too so\nYes this is a really great study that came out again are Bebe scam tracker is so great it's really it's just so much information we really want everybody to go there to search report scams\nAnd that information that we get from that allows us to create these research studies that help us determine how are people getting scanned why is this still happening you know everybody thinks that they're not vulnerable what vulnerable but everybody is and and why is that what what are they saying what are their stories and that's\nReally you know get into the emotion of why people are giving them the information so\nThis project study is basically um two things is the employment scam is a big part of this so people are getting jobs and they're getting paid with a check and it's more than the amount that their own and they're told to give a piece of it send it to another account\nAnd people need to realize that crediting at bank account does not mean that that cash check is a valid can come back\nA week later and be a fraud check and if you already sent money from your checking account to somebody else you are not going to get that back especially if you sent it you know what the wire transfer\nSo that's really a big deal and cashiers checks in postal money orders\nThey can be forged in a lot of people think oh that's the way to go but know that those can be forged too so\nScammers are reaching out to you and they're giving you fraudulent checks and we're sending money to you know other accounts on their behalf and you just need to really um watch out for that but that research study is that BP dot ORG\nYeah and you've ... you've gotten several dozen a report on the BBC scammed tracker just locally about this so yes\nAnd big time and we've had people lose quite a bit of money impacts someone just reported it last week so we definitely um the way he lost I think Fifteen hundred dollars and it was into increments so you just have to be so careful and\nScammers unfortunately are are smart and they know how to to get to you emotionally\nAnd I'm Still getting those calls are from Microsoft from India to\n[laughter] oh man oh yeah busy over the\nUh the telling me that\nEvery day though that telling me that there is something wrong with my with my account so Microsoft doesn't usually I don't think they call people\nAnd ... actually requiring now a man now and tell you now that now my ... fat when just won't go away you know that you know here's my fiance he didn't talk for I Know I did you make me proud thank\nYou very much the twenty Nineteen torture words are coming up this is kind of a signature of that of the better Business Bureau or what's the latest on that\nYeah where's the backside add that this is going to be happening I made their heads next year and now it seems like it\nNext year so far away and they will be here that for me now and it's going to be act has seen it fell again but this year we've really kind of change did that as far as the categories go so you can and learn more information at BB be that a work but I Want to know when everyone's now that it's\nAn ethics category and sparks category now so the ethics and is for profit which is based on business science now\nEntered leave open it up for non profit because of our charity review program very good I Love it and said that's based on revenue and then of course we kept our sparkle word which is and\nFor owners that are thirty five years younger\nThan that and if this is and they have their own award very good ferry\nTwenty Nineteen torture wards friday may third casino del sol nominations now open and will be closing on November the thirtieth for more information about the b._b._c. go to BBC dot O.
