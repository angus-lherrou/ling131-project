his whole it illegal immigration debate it doesn't matter if they committed mass shootings they murdered innocent Americans so it's like the argument that people make and I was going to make this Geraldo Rivera and some of the others does\nIt and I don't even think it's true the percentage of illegals he won't admit their legal she calls them undocumented who commit crimes or even less than an American native born Americans so what\nIf they commit one crime in the here illegally one murder like Kate Steinle he would go on and on that and that's one that wouldn't have been committed if they weren't allowed to enter the country that is a crazy argument that's kind of thing President Obama would do you set up a straw dummy\nIt doesn't matter if the percentages of same they shouldn't be here ... those people would be alive like that girl can't think of her name and Iowa also named Hisham resources\nAre better than I can be here who are committing crimes rather than people who are here legally committed a crime\nYou spend the resources on anybody who commit crimes yeah Molly tip it's what's her name but with all due respect ban it's a phony arguments so maybe they didn't do it you know a mass shooting what what is your point there\nIt doesn't make any sense they shouldn't be here the first place and I said it gave me a great segue but I Want to go to Karen and no Claire

here legally as one caller pointed out\nWhich one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if there are legal they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and if someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was there a town but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the

went to work got minimum wage\nAnd Illinois here it turns out he could have been getting instead of the eight dollars nine dollars an hour minimum wage\nHe could have been getting a point to about twenty to forty if he would have taken all the benefits for welfare [noise]\nI Would propose that why don't we know that not welfare down\nTo where it's a forty hour week minimum wage pay check you spend it on on just spend it on cars whatever that takes care of the welfare side but those people who are more fair who want more money and go get a job be picking fruit out of them out of the\nOrchards or what have you\nAnd actually have the potential of earning more than minimum wage\nMakes perfect sense that's a good idea and we think his son for a service let's go to rose in

ancestors came by to talk about it Alice island they would never carried flex from their home countries they were seeking freedom they were ... sneaking a new life\nThe whole point and it's so discouraging when they come here they bring a lot of the same culture in terms of even voting for people like try to get away from that got away from governments we try to tell them what to do with their lives and they both the same thing when they get here let's go to Paul in Littleton, Colorado Paul you're on was mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call Sean hey I wanted to follow\nUp on your comment earlier about ah the term illegal alien a button and a different a vein or you know the advocates of amnesty and\nHigh levels of immigration of always described the illegal alien population is one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nWell the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs in order to find a job they gotta fill out an eye on foreign and when they do that and say they are here legally to commit perjury which is a felony\nOr the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers ... or ... somewhat Social Security numbers a separate Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent of the illegal aliens are here\nTo work uh have been violating these laws\nBut nobody ever mentions it and they're not otherwise law abiding it's simple you know\nMy daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal alien using her Social Security number which were stolen which was a child\nMhm so uh I don't know why the conservatives Republicans don't push back on this whole illegal thing oh by by describing what's happening here in internally when people come into work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that how someone gets into a country we call that legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nIt seems so obvious to me and that's why you have to have when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been a terrific a boost to the United states from er yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx ...

a huge game at Iowa City this weekend between northwestern in Iowa go hawk or yeah [laughter]\nSo it is a fun time of year it is just been so much horrible news of course with the [noise]\nThe shooting a at the synagogue it turns out that you have to be I Believe the worst anti Semitic or\nViolent incident in this country's history a it is it is absolutely is\nAnd and um we do want to mention ray mentioned that in the headlines that tonight there is a vigil at the Jewish community center it's a candlelight vigil this would be a multi faith prayer vigil at seven o'clock at the Jaycee see\nAh the Jewish Federation of southern Arizona the Jewish Tucson Jewish community center synagogues in community Jewish agencies are hosting the vigil we just had this rat it's been a real bad couple a days for these horrible instance John ...\nWell it's been a bad period of time you know um\nWe've we've had it on both sides and uh I'm not blaming anybody but you know we had Steve ... a shot a last year on a baseball field where they uh\nThe shooter came in and tried to shoot up the entire Republican congressional caucus on the baseball field\nI'm a I don't blame anybody for that except the shooter um I don't I I\nI think we've had a lot of things a lot of things have gone unreported\nOf that is that the press has not picked up on the last couple of weeks we've had several Republican congressional offices local offices or\nA trash boulders throat thrown to their windows uh locally here no across the country to country and the press doesn't pick up on those but uh it's on both sides\nUh we've got wackos\nI'm Out there and it needs to stop\nAh people ah people need to um get real this is a free country violence has no place in the political process I just finished watching a documentary by Ken Burns and the Vietnam War\nAnd um you know there was a lot of hatred in the streets but it didn't turn into general a political violence except on the part of\nA couple of just a couple of real wackos a bomb some post offices and thing the weatherman or whether mine my underground yeah um but this needs to stop and um\nWe need to come together recognize that we have a chance for an election here people need to get on with the election\nWe'll come back it is the political face off John monitoring jak Rogers with me in Studio the face of presented by most gallery and find\nFraming for law and dodge Adriana has been waiting seven nine zero twenty forty go ahead Adriana\n[noise] thank you bail okay so I was just like to say so that incident with this person that commit a crime I thought that it is in general is just said that all of us are labeled that way to label us as criminals and someone that wind that we are Americans are okay and then the party so\nUm I don't think anyone Leming every one\nWe're just saying that there's a toxic political atmosphere that's one thing that John and I can agree on here that we have a very toxic political atmosphere I assess the blame a little differently than John does as to how we got here but uh that I think it's the atmosphere that's leading these kind of people who used to stay under their rocks to come out and uh and and and\nYou have a few are doing that but you can't so I hear your rhetoric oh we're in American I'm going to marry ... okay I follow the law I paid a lot I ... that the constitution as an all\nYou guys had no message OK but hate envy\nAlright Adriana than Louis oh okay I'm going to move along\nGreg is with us seven nine zero twenty forty hello Greg\nGood morning or good afternoon bill and John and Jeff I Jeff you mentioned so please allow me to finish and then I Do don't interrupt you said a global as does a code word for Jews a vet so ludicrous that's ridiculous and I come from a Jewish background and\nThere's been no better friend to Israel\nA says George Washington than Donald Trump if you if you want to you know just as Benjamin Netanyahu\nAnd we know about Iraq Obama's past we know about the river right when Reverend Wright was condemning America and and his association with Farrakhan\nNow here's what's interesting is well the news wants to take us over here the media wants to look over here at a there was some powder scent to all these congresspeople and supposedly a pipe bomb and the tragedy of course that happened over the weekend in in Pittsburgh but here's what we're not looking at\nSheryl Sheryl kissing\nFormer CBS News reporter was doing stories during the Obama administration\nWhich are unkind honest but they didn't like it so they were getting into her computer and that's not a conspiracy theory was their she'd get own flowers will delete it so she presently as a lawsuit against that wonderful attorney general Eric Holder who's responsible to Justice Department of for for doing that\nOkay I'm not sure go ahead All right Jeff do you want to respond to a caller Greg well what\nSeeing today is unprecedented in American history we've never had this kind of toxic political atmosphere and it needs to change and ... and and the only way it can changes is two fold one Democrats need to win big on next Tuesday a hand the president needs to get its act together\nUm and the people surrounding the president and he does need to basically rain him in and make them behave if they can if they're capable of doing that and if they have the spine to do it\nAnd I've seen a whole lot of evidence of but that has to start at the top he has to quit being so toxic and quit uh having these rallies where where he encourages violence and and the misbehavior\nOf you know I I'm Sorry once again I listen to his rallies he isn't there is nothing\nNothing Jeff and I listen to all of them there's nothing he said that encourages any violence he has been most conciliatory he is not sending out the tweets that he used to send out he's much more a presidential in the last year\nAre you guys you guys just refuse to accepting has to accept him as your president because you were expecting don't put crooked Hillary into office even though she had she was what started this whole thing\nIs that Hillary Clinton\nBroke the law repeatedly\nAnd got away with it because the swamp the insiders in in Washington refused a prosecutor because they thought she was going to be president and that outrages me and it outrageous a bunch of other people but I Will tell you\nThat until you people except Donald Trump as the duly elected president and get over your resistance\nAnd and move on you can't you can't live off of making up code words that you think is a code word and nobody else does our that's just more hey Jeff everybody agrees with no I don't I don't agree with that\nAre already agreed let's move on to the election that's coming up we have or early voting ending actually a Wednesday is the deadline Jeff how do you think the Democrats are going to do [noise]\nState wider yet they white and nationwide statewide I think we've got a chance to pick up a few statewide positions I'm not optimistic for her she is chances to take the governorship he's made some huge enforced errors or in his candidacy and uh I'm very disappointed with with the campaign that he's running the mistakes that he's made\nSo I don't think we're going to get that I think Kirsten Sinema has a good chance to win\nThe election of for the Senate position I think it'll still be close could go either way but I I'd say right now she has the edge over mix Sally Kirkpatrick when you're afternoons easily I'm sure of\n'em out Halloran wins the CD one\nCD one year and a and I think will do well in the state house and the state Senate I don't know if we're uh on the verge of capturing the majority of either one I think we have a slight chance to maybe in the Senate House probably not so much nationwide I think we probably do see a bit of a blue wave and we take the house of representatives\nOr the Senate map is is a little daunting for us I just can't see how we can overcome\nThe number of seats were defending in so many red states will be lucky to hold a the edge that we are the the margin we've got right now will be very lucky to hold on to that and probably need send them to win and uh and and the Nevada Senate race we need to pick that one up\nA probably to to even stay where we're at what do you think John well I think that Republicans do better than had been advertising\nOh absolutely or we're going to pick up one two three seats and the Senate um we're going to a uh it's going to be very tight in the house typically are the Democrats would pick up and this type of race just enough seats just an\nAverage election year in her mid term to win a majority in the house it\nWill not be a blue wave it'll be a typical uh election mid term election it's going to come down to one to three seats in the house as to who wins um\nI I think whoever wins the house is going to be almost a incapable of doing anything much\nUm if the Democrats win they will hold a a a investigations are if this if the Republicans hold the Senate which they will uh they will be doing investigations from the other side nobody I'll be able to do much I'm\nSo not much gets done in the next two years\nI don't think much gets done I think the good news is Donald Trump from my perspective Donald Trump has done so much already uh that uh we're we're fairly happy with the status quo but the blue wave is gone it won't be a blue wave it'll be a pretty average election both sides are motivated\nAt in terms of the local Arizona races I agree with Jeff that uh that the governor a doozy will win that election\nI agree that uh that the Senate race between curse in cinema and mix Sally is very tight I saw pulled a day that had those CBS or a poll that said that um [noise]\nA nine hundred and eighty to voters that said send them I was up by two percent\nSo it's within the margin of hair I have a four and a half point margin All right guys in the remaining too I think Halloran oh Halloran will lose okay there's your production there that turn for colonel Rogers are winning according to John monger alright a quick comment on what happened\nIn Brazil with the election of the populist\nA far right candidate Geoff what's going on around the world with this there is a resurgence of a populist there isn't it a kind of a nationalism and populism that we're seeing a particularly in Eastern Europe the former Soviet Bloc countries are rejecting democracy and and and pluralism\nWe're seeing that in South America as well um and ah this this guy from in Brazil is going to be dangerous I mean he is homophobic\nHe's ... years ago he is he's he's he's a he's going to be a dangerous talking about starting a straight as the way to start at ... well he he are the ad hominem attack a admit error we got a honey admits these things no he ... he admits he sanctioned ran on them\nSo you know that that's the truth is hard to take some ... and John your take on the ... of people\nAre not rejecting democracy what they are rejecting as bureaucratic control in the case of Europe from the you\nThey don't want the the bureaucrats and he you are running\nA running what's happening in Czechoslovakia or hungry check the Czech Republic or Slovak uh Slovak Republic they don't want the you running what's going on in Hungary\nAbsolutely yes and that's another thing that puts it in the suspicious category the legislature has begun something that the best way to call it is a zero tolerance campaign about these a citizen based initiatives\nWhat they said is that you can make absolutely no errors on that partition form so that person carrying that petition\nForgets to put their own ZIP Code say\nThat means the entire position as a petition every single image signature his thrown out if they even put the wrong ZIP Code the same thing can happen as for individual voters and I'm not kidding about this is if you haven't been\nSigning any petition slightly you might not know this but if\nYour name leaks out of the two lines of supposed to be between if you have a G. or why do you go below the line they can throughout that signature for that reason so the whole idea is to make it as difficult as possible and it's pretty clear why\nThe legislature and put on initiatives very easily just for by a blow to the legislature\nBut when people do it will listen to what's going on this year you can vote this year 'cause it made it on the ballot to limit\nPrivate school vouchers\nThat's not something that the legislature and the governor wants there for more private school vouchers\nYou could vote this year to increase the use of clean energy over the years that will hit a point where we have to use a certain amount of clean energy that that would be the law once again\nThe legislature and the governor or against those why did they want these things to happen was invested in head we just talked about that being thrown out and another one with the thrown out that they really hate is out ... dark money dark money though it goes to both parties to some extent those the vast majority\nTo Republicans so they would rather not have these initiatives to they can stop it with the legislation that zero tolerance legislation and then if the Supreme Court\nAdopts also is zero tolerance policy which means there can't be anything wrong with the way it's word of the way it's written the slightest bit of problem with the opposition the people who said it should be on the two people on the Supreme Court said that they said\nOf course they don't have it perfectly that's not the point of these have got to be close and then the rest of it can be argued by uh the voters and by the people who are campaigning for so it's a it's a very difficult position as a a hard time for citizen initiatives\nAnd I think either going to be less of them or they're going to have to have more money behind them\nWell I think ... if maybe a caller can correct me but I think Arizona's one of the few states that has the citizen initiatives I Believe when our constitution was adopted mistake there was this just trust of government\nAnd uh they felt that this would be a way to let the citizens or have a say but I don't think many states\nTo let the citizens or have a say but I don't think many
