Would actually have to cross over mountains to get two with dinner or lunch\n\nTo go into ... recall the San Fernando valley here in Southern California\nSo it was a very very sleepy town and but this Institute that brought me as a Jewish Institute one of the largest Jewish retreat sensors in the world and is located in Simi Valley California so they brought me out to be the director was a young

the rule in ... in Rotary Club but you have to be in the Rotary Club you have to be the owner of a business or the head of something\nThat that was the way it works for a chapter and I think only one

nothing\nIs that clear Mr producers that clear no other place\nIf I have been in a similarly small city Rotary Club in France they wouldn't they wouldn't have necessarily been anti Semitic but it

are and what we represent and is telling the world that we all back\nWith a good guys and if you want to be our friends you can be friends and if you threaten us we will deal with you in the requisite way\nAnd gotten respect for it with all the left portrayal of him as a laughing stock the truth is he is widely respected\nAnd fit that well they have to go together\nYes but when when you have Beijing when you have to um when you have Moscow worrying that's a good thing the left doesn't understand that but that is a very very good thing\nAnd he has also ... this is I have not said this to my listeners yet 'cause this is very new in my own mind but\nHe has done something else he has at least for the time being sent the message to the world that left ism is not inevitable\nYes he is prepared to challenge thing is that nobody else would be prepared to do in the mainstream conservative movement but I mean just just one moment from from Saturday last Saturday\nWhen he had a Catholic Kavanaugh family in in the White House and what did he do he stood up in front of the world\nAnd the clad the innocence of this man\nThat's the moral force to choose of Donald Trump\nHe doesn't care whether you agree with him he knows what's right such as recognizing Jerusalem as the title capital the Jewish state moving you have to think about the fact that it's for twenty three years every American president than promised that and every six months this is the absurdity every six months\nThe incumbent president have to sign a waiver to say sorry guys not now I mean this is what the Mac and cut through\nWhen he stayed with Brett Kavanaugh I kept thinking oh there are even Republicans who would not have\nOh my gosh yes I mean [noise] and the way he handled it was so ... he was careful he was quiet and then when he saw all the way this man\nHave for for his reputation justly\nThe way that good Americans not just you know hot cool raking all it's just the average Americans were incensed what did he do he stood up and he he highlighted the gaping flaws\nIn full of testimony at his rally and he forced the media to play that ten second clip\nAgain and again and again I didn't think of it that way oh my gosh yeah because they refuse to cooperate with that and we want to thank God the faucet that's right that's exactly right\nThe this this president I'll tell you another thing that the cabin or hearing revealed to be although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but a confirmation I should say more than anything else\nAnd this will really shocked a lot of people to load the man I think he has a good horse\nDonald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what Dr phil left insane and they will never believe it whether it's\nInviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or or whether it's holding the hand of that that an African American grandmother whose son had been killed\nVet visits who he is that and the shocking thing that I can tell you because I worked for him and I I right now the instances and why we fight us the evidence of this\nHe he is compassionate\nTo you as an American whether you voted for him or not he doesn't care he doesn't see skin color you don't see party affiliation if you're an American you deserve to be safe and you deserve to prosper and fat or friend flew never going to have been federalized by the hardcore left\nFinally a in why we fight your book and again it is up to Dennis ... dot com my friends and you know if it's Sebastian Gorka wrote it it's pretty self recommending [laughter] but I I have been saying for years\nAnd I think I was one of the first and I'm not saying this to brag I'm ... I'm seeing it because\nIt's now become common place\nOr more so in any event\nThat we are in a civil war how do you react to that\n[noise] coming from people who live through war my parents as children lived or on the Nazi occupation than my father was torched it in prison by the communists [noise]\nI I find it difficult to use that phrase and I also remember that the the the great this death toll in any war America's fault wasn't in Korea wasn't in Vietnam was in the world will too but it was in our civil war six hundred thousand killed so I I have a a kind of it [noise] a block\nAgain I I respect that so I I was using shorthand my listeners know why I like almost always add and thank God it's non violent right so if I attached that adjectives\nIn the right way obviously but you have to see what you believe at all times\nYou cannot shake what you're saying oh for a grade world because it will come back to haunt you later you have to say what you stand for\nThen you can sleep well at night and as I tell the parents of the kids in college yeah if they learn to deny who they are in college for a grade\nWill they be honest when the stakes are greater later in life\nThat's my question All right my friend's\nDennis Prager here for ... chair as I always know to you I'm sitting on my sponsor thank God my sponsor in this case is inanimate as an animate

from palm [noise]\nWhat could the left do that would in fact be a tipping point for a non left wing Americans to say oh they really are a danger to everything we cherish\nOr even if that's to overstated I Do believe they are a danger to everything I cherish fine but even not going that far just sing at what point will people said the left has gone too far that's what that's\nMaybe by the way I totally entertained the possibility that there is no point if if a man can win a biological mail can win the women's cycling contest as happened this weekend\nAnd people are at peace with that than I truly entertain the possibility there is nothing too far if ten years ago let alone forget twenty five years ago even ten people\nWould be told that a biological male who said he's a female\nWould win a women's bicycling contest they would have said that's ridiculous that's not fair you cannot have a biological bail otherwise that's the end of Women's Sports\nIf every biological male who was an athlete who wants to I Am identifies as a female is allowed to play against females that's the end the female sports\nSo it shows you the left doesn't that I've always said this the left doesn't care about black select doesn't care about females who cares about power it cares about chaos if wishes to disrupt the ... the order of civilization as it stands it it's a force for chaos for anarchy\n\nThis is proof if they cared about women they would say it's not fair you can't have a biological males compete against biological females\nBut they don't care\nBlacks are beginning to understand not in the numbers that I Would like to see but nevertheless I Would I Believe that it's significant Kanye West is is sort of a idiosyncratic tip of the iceberg\nOf a blacks oh just today

that this is happening in a lot now\n\nAnd I'm like you to see we've now put it up but then is pretty good about calm because like I gave you the wrong information earlier the talk that I gave\nAt the largest conservative synagogue west of the Mississippi in in LA last week about Jews in the left I I don't normally put by talks up I I give a give about a hundred fifty lectures a year I I I mention almost none of them\nBut this was a significant\nMy ... my embarrassment\n\nBite my embarrassment as a committed you have to support the ... that so many Jews have for the left\nIt's just an embarrassment I I don't know what else to say it's that there were synagogues that went into the Jewish morning ritual of sitting ship up after Donald Trump was elected\nIs is a disgrace to Judaism they disgraced a beautiful religion by taking a religious act and so politicizing it\nBut it's it's the narcissism of the left and obviously it it's in the mainstream Protestantism it's a it's in the
