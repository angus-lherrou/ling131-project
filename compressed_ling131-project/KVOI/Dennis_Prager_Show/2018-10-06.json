bigger story than I'm getting it through this is the first single the one they were going to knock it in there wasn't a lot Democrats well no there was a lot Democrats could do they just had to get out and vote in two thousand fourteen to say and they could have voted into more in two thousand sixteen\nSo ah basically the theatrics are is pretty much all they've got unless unless they actually

remember a Democrat being up in a Senate race in any poll going back to ... and since you can see any but\nIt's one of those cinema was going to win a Senate seat I Believe it when I see it right now I'm very much that neither neither nice to have it yet but send them is running ahead and uh that's I I'm ...\nYears by a few in the number one I I Know Martha and I know her well and I I like her very very much\nEven when I was working for Jesse Kelly I liked her ... you know I didn't like her campaign people at the time but I liked her\nSo when she finally came back and ran again I'm like I'm all in and so for the last two you know and I don't even live in her congressional district but I'm going to be important to southern Arizona as far as I was concerned and I think she's got a fantastic job\nSo when she decided to run for Senate there are two things that I I I liked about her why she didn't wait\nTo see what was going to happen with John McCain she says I'm going to go ahead and run for Jeff Flake have yet to place that I'm resigning she weighed no she just she said this is what what to do this when I'm going to do is get it\nSecondly she's like I said she's a she's a very very strong candidate but here is my point I've been looking at a lot of polling and I've seen it up and down and and neck and neck I guarantee you after today's vote for cabinet and he has confirmed to the Supreme Court\nShe when she when she when she wins 'cause gift in cinema looks like and has acted like her entire political life like all the screeners in the elevator and I think that's going to hurt scripted said well you can't if\nCures in cinema had acted her entire political life like all the screeners in the elevator then we'd have a better idea who Christmas gifts and send them is because she is so she started\nOff as a Green Party slaves that were in one of the Marxist linen this toward from the Arizona Communist Party for goodness sakes can now she's a blue dog who ... who came out and no matter if you're not as a fifty percent voting record that Donald Trump I'm not saying this is the early helps her\nHey I've got to a caller I'm a ... another good friend of mine was to build beard bill you're on the air inside tracks with Jim Kelly and Blake more lack\nEarlier conversation about what I think you're missing something fundamental here I think a lot of the Democrats are in\nWhich is the case that the whole cabinet thing has thought about in a lot of people buy the argument is it's not about he said she said the me too movement et cetera it ...\nIt transcend fat in this way what\nWe're talking about here in the middle of a civilization argument do you want to have a civilization as society a constitutional however you want to define this that is based on the idea that whatever the mom says we do\nOr do we want and I want a society a catheters republic based on the idea of due process innocent until proven guilty et cetera we can share and argue about the need to live that we can sit here and argue about who believes lazy for civil east Brett Kavanaugh until the blue in the face\nYou do\nFor the average person sitting out there listening to this stuff watching to it on watching it on TV you don't say to them okay\nYou a happy an accusation one side of the argument decides to hold onto the hold onto it without any corroborating evidence\nHeal the last what happens\nWhen you get on people and then expect everything don't grind to a halt simply because you waited until the last split second do it\nIt's not supposed to work that way any constitutional republic it is not fundamentally now and when you do in the way the Democrats had been doing it for the last several weeks and some could argue for the last several decades but for the last several weeks\nOn the left and the white and especially in the middle\nTake one look at what's going on and see what the Democrats and uh the the screaming and that that that stopping people and yelling at them in the elevator and airport kicking them out of a restaurant\nYou don't do that and don't have a visceral reaction on the on the part of the average American citizen to tell those people to do that hell away\nThat you build place you've got a response ah yeah I Do um first of all I don't like this whole thing where you're kicking people out of restaurants running amount of restaurants but to get to your points\nTiming timing gets brought up a lot in this the timing was set by Anthony Kennedy and when he resigned Mitch McConnell could have kept the Senate in session through August done all this you August the ... the reason there was a time crunch\nIsn't even because it's gonna be the the the Supreme Court session is going to start is because there was a mid term and ... and Republicans were afraid they were going to lose the Senate\nAnd so they want to get this done that was the timing issue innocent until proven guilty\nAgain that is the burden for that that the burden for a job interview that's a burden for a quarter lot nobody's talking about taking Brett Kavanaugh removing him from society putting them in a cell they're talking about giving him the biggest president and the legal community\nThat ... that that's something completely different and as far as the middle of the middle of the road again most vote the I'm Kevin out doesn't really have that ... is it a very popular\nI'm a candidate for the court when you look historically he's under water in the polls I'm not arguing that means you should or shouldn't be there but all ... and finally this whole thing about the mob rules I noticed when it's a Tea Party\nIt's direct democracy that people are speaking when it's the other side and both sides can can do this it's the mob your group is the voice of the people box populist vox day the other side is the unruly mob oh my God we got to stay away from you know we have to be protected from\nI just want to ask you one thing a Blake the last job interviews that you had um did you have will you be interrupted every Fifteen minutes by screeners\nOr yelling or a bow unqualified you weren't go I'm just asking do you have you in any job interview did you have people who don't know you stand up and start screaming and saying you're not qualified for the job or ... or you know get no no no no no no don't don't vote okay well my my last job interview with\nDylan Smith Starbucks on granting swan I was not being up for a position where I Would be able to basically on a whim decide how this country operate how people live their lives day to\nDay I still do that my my boy is is this this whole city or higher achievement it's a ridiculous analogy to talk about a job interview 'cause it's 'cause it's ... it's more than that it's obviously more than that so to try to diminish this down to a job interview trust me I\nIf it had been a job interview for me and Fifteen you know every Fifteen minutes I'm being interrupted while answering questions by people sit behind me and screaming at me not only would I have gotten up and left\nBut they would have gotten a little bit more my mind then or even like have a Brett Kavanaugh gave a on his last day of testimony so\nI'm just so I I did it I hate that whole thing of the job interview it diminishes ... what what advice can vote on this for the nomination of of the Supreme Court as it's bigger than that\nBill thank you so much of anything else that you want to give\nWay\nI Love reading your column at that it's definitely a cycle but on this specific issue I think you're still missing the fundamental problem for the average person out there that transcends politics this transcends that the idea of he said she said the timing all of that stuff is\n... it's not even a lot of people's ... radar screen when they think about fundamentally what happened in the last couple of weeks you had someone essentially publicly\nCrucified in a
