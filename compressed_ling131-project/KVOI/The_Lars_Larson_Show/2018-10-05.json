Eighteen years home schooling his two children teaching part time at cornerstone university and ministry and pope it's around Grand Rapids\nMore than anything his life had been devoted to investing in

me a little bit more time my question for you is\nYou have any idea how long you have are you going to get another five years than six months maybe you won't be here tomorrow night\nWhat are you doing to make sure that you already even in death or dead was teaching in ministry is so let's return back to Shiloh\nMy father left people all his life and wanted them to know crushed personally he provided my brother and me with a tangible example of living resilient face he taught us to face life with the courage and confidence the guy who carries through any storm we face\nEven if it's the storm the ends our life\nHe taught us to live each day intentionally to be ready to hold nothing back because we never know if all have tomorrow\nWhen he returned home from his first surgery he opened up about his own feelings he told me he was satisfied with the way he spent his life as a Christian and knowing what he'd done I could see why\nHe passed in the church he taught at a Christian university he'd spread the gospel to the radio and written publication\nBut when he signed a cross for me that day he didn't mention any of those things\nHe looked me in the eye and said you and your brother or my best investments when I remember those words I'm reminded of the year and she sent home schooling is\nEvenings he went fishing in the lake the time he took his campaign he said no he never cared for life in a tent\nThe advice he was always so willing to dispense when you needed it\nThe late night conversations and we are to engrossed look at the clock on the nights he and my mom talked to some of the bad looking had you know how much time my father has left perhaps the only a matter of months\nNow he will probably not walk me down the aisle now he will not see his grandchildren\nBut compared to what he's done for us and the time he had toasting become pretty small\nHe gave us his party message as a reminder to use the time we have so I Want to take this opportunity to remind him that's been poured into my life I think that\nAnd beautifully done Shiloh [noise] and Ken her father my goodness what a thing all of us want our daughters to say you said as his daughter I can say that he held nothing back in raising my brother and me you also said he looked me in the eye and said\nYou and your brother or my best investments beautiful life is short and it
