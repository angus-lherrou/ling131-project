mansion voted for bread cabinet the Democrat in West Virginia But West Virginia is the most pro Trump state in the union impact Morsi is going to join me later in the show is going to drive home\nThat if you vote for Joe mansion you're voting against Donald Trump and for Chuck Schumer so that is\nThat's eight different races\nThat the Republicans could pick up they're not going to lose any that could pick up eight in the Senate one of the reasons is also because of Medicare\nMedicare is on the ballot so don't touch my Medicare dot com don't touch my Medicare dot com run by the association of American citizens a Mac\nThey're fighting the Bernie Sanders attempt to destroy Medicare when they say Medicare for all that means destroy Medicare is you know what you paid for it and give one single

to give us your Rogers Park by John crazy [noise]\nDuring middle nonstop action packed information [noise] she was [noise]\nIt's an issue that you care about more than any other one that's hitting the pocket books of American families are the outrageous cost of prescription drugs\nIn a recent poll conducted by Frank once he got an earful words like Greek gouging unfair kept coming up there are lots of questions why do the drug costs skyrocketing might be on candidate fake forty percent less for medications and we do in America why does the whole system feel Rick\nThere's an answer big drug maker spend a lot of money laundering to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobby in America are politicians must answer to we the people\nTired old drug makers accountable for patients at a profit yeah there are a lobbyist and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories and our votes tired and the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people\nEnough is enough demand transparency in truth truth in pricing when it comes to prescription drugs for this is the shoo shoo shoo [noise]\nYou know want to have a response to this sound [noise] you're neutral to [noise] you hear me every time you finish your meal and never feel anything [noise]\nBut if we were able to associate this sound with a nice stimulus [noise] like the food we've achieved pulling in natural response from the [noise] the food\nYet there's and there's quite a few names that are being floated um there's certainly a you know the the the current CD you general secretary as a woman very close to Chancellor Merkel is considered to be the closest person to Chancellor Merkel\nUm she hurt her name her first name is Anna Gratz a last name as ... bar she goes by the initials K. K.\nAnd um she certainly could be I think if if Chancellor Merkel had a chance to pick he would pick AK\nOr she would pick AKA and and they both worked very closely closely together so um she's one name I think ...\nWith the current health minister who has Ben I'm kind of the the the conservative wing of um Chancellor Merkel's party\nI he's been a thorn in her side I'm trying to get her to move closer to um the conservatives he's been the leader of the young\nCD you movement I think he's got a very real chance I'm certainly uh the the defense minister minister von der lion Ursula von der line she's a in a very impressive person um ... has been a member of the city for a long time she's done well at the defense ministry\nUm so I think she's got a chance or one of the issues I think in in German politics is they tend to look for somebody very young because they want somebody to be around for a long time\nI'm not sure that that's going to happen this time there have been some talk about just getting somebody who can do a really good job for a couple of years and not have to have somebody who's looking for you know a ten to Fifteen Years fan\nThat's very kind of an German they usually want somebody who is going to bring stability for very long time if they went with someone who um you know really knows how to how to run the country has been in in uh in power\nUm seats or you could look to what's gang shy blah who is a long term um finance minister and now he is um [noise] the president of the boom just dog\nWe're going to be six years old and he's a little bit older but I think the the business community really looks at Wolfgang shy blind says this is a guy who really knows the system and knows how to carry us through\nWe're gonna want stability in Europe that's to me I I Hope whoever emerges from this and that you were working with those are embarrassing or provides for instability in a post brags that you have to ask you a ... you know it was a bastard or to Germany a neo Nazi\nAttacked and killed Thirteen eleven people in Pittsburgh and we've been grieving that but I look up and I see my friends at MSNBC with a ... that says how Trump quote sets the tone quote unquote for anti Semite and and my heart just fails because\nThe president is the least bad I mean I've got my problems with them I always have but but he's not got a liquor anti Semitism in\nIt it's outrageous and you know him better than most ... what do you think of a crime run that says how Trump quote sets the tone for anti Semite\nCompletely outrageous it's completely divisive the president has made a key policy decisions um and and really focused the U.S government\nOn a on a number of issues that really are not only pro Israel that are a pro Jewish community but\nThat have really set the bar I think unlike any other president in trying to to make sure that I'm tolerance and diversity celebrated look it's no secret I I'm I'm gay and and I've seen some of the the same types of\nOf arguments about the president um when it comes to gay rights and I have to say just from my personal experience I've waited a very long time to have a president\nWho would embrace me embrace the community and and really Sunday very strong message of diversity intolerance and I think this president does it\nA similar smear that spread yesterday was against GOP house majority leader Kevin McCarthy who would criticize George Soros and others for spending lots of money\nOn Democrats which they have done and the mean began he use those names because they are Jewish names these implying that Jewish money is attempting to her politics of course\nThe Koch brothers spend a lot of money and Sheldon Adelson who was also joined spend a lot of money on the Republican I think it's just an outright smear record now you've been around your your in diplomacy now but you've been around American politics a long time is there no limit to how low the left will go to smoke\nOur time is there no limit to how low the left will go to ... smear people\nWell let me just let me just say this um because you know I Am in a diplomatic position I Want to be very careful [noise] um I I Want to say unequivocally that I'm Kevin McCarthy is my friend I Know him from California\nAnd and that's an outrageous charge against Kevin it's wrong it's not it's outrageous and and we should not have politics of destruction like this\nThat is exactly at you and I both know McCarthy and the idea he that he talking about SARS and Bloomberg and stagger giving money that that is somehow anti Semitic when in fact that it's simply an objective\nLook at who is funding just like eight or something and coke or funding us a record outlet make let me caused by asking is um how soon will it be when we will have clarity as to who the next German Chancellor will be\nWell first of all we will know in December who the next party chair is and that will be um largely the signal so I Would say in December we will know um how the transition will go in and how quickly it will be\nI appreciate your joining me on short notice Ambassador Richard gr now the United states ambassador to Germany always a very powerful and effective voice for America abroad and in Germany good luck in keeping us posted in keeping our interest represented well in Berlin is he has done\nFor the past year I I Want to tell everyone out there as well [noise] that one of the uh\nI Will not let this Kevin McCarthy is let her go unanswered right it is it is traffic in the left I've known Kevin since Nineteen eighty nine years as a Middle East and I ate there isn't a\nInch a tank sure of anti Semitism in his as welcoming everyone of all races and backgrounds as anyone you possibly could\nAnd that that it's being ginned up isn't it I again I'll tell you the Democrats are desperate they thought they had a blue wave they don't have a blue wave\nThey thought that the bomber would help them it hasn't helped them they thought that um ah they could somehow make the president responsible for Pittsburgh that didn't work nothing is working for them because people don't want Nancy Pelosi backers speaker and they are voting to increase Mitch McConnell's\nMajorities in the Senate and therefore it just bottom of the barrel time and smearing Kevin McCarthy as an anti Semite is the lowest of low not the lowest of low and I won't let it pass\nNot pass either it's a time to tell you about really factor dot com Monday morning I Hope you had a good weekend\nI'm feeling better though my voice has donated like
