I'm a ... I'm very upset by this as anyone would be 'cause he's a contributor to the posed as I Am and apparently a fearless journalist but I've set very little because I interviewed John Bolton on Thursday over the all the OB when Jim run in Kenya and the president I was over in the tech very wards off his\nPocket and John Bolton that link and he says America doesn't know yet and then the president repeated that last night what do you hear about this Mike Allen as to what happened to ... to show me\nWell there's still some mystery about it and I've talked to the soldiers who are quite\nFamiliar with this situation and\nThere there is\nA lot going on among the intelligence services but I think\nPretty obvious what happened and\nI don't think that anybody is going to be some praise\nOr to find out the reality I Am surprised by how low\nThe American administration and American business was respond to it so actually is damned print not just wanting a pop up that I'm\nA break into these Steve Schwartzman is not gonna not going to stay in the ... in the desert last night it was just announced that she means I'm In ... and she's also now\nThe administration still is acting like there's more mysteries and there is like what is not known is why this was done why there's a calculation was made who could possibly have thought this was a good idea\nWell that's what raises the interesting for me um you know the Henry the second story he said a to a bunch of court here is that we will read me of this metal some priest referring to Thomas back and forth is valid throw it up and murdered in in the in the cathedral and and then the second was mortified he didn't want that\nUh and you can see the possibility for an overzealous can be as supportive doing as you can see the ... the possibility of direct order from NBS which can also see the possibility of a rogue element in the royal family ordering and here's what I don't get like\nThe Turks say they've got audio and video if they've got audio and video there a NATO ally they just let it our hostage go shouldn't we be\nAbsolutely certain of what happened at this point if they got audio and video\nMakes logical sense\nThere is not seen it so there's some question about it\nWe clearly know American intelligence based on the reporting of our great these organizations including the Washington Post American intelligence there's a ton more about this than the president does wedding on\nThat's okay that would be then they would be covering for him but yes and that is not a good luck or or good at all it's\nNot just to be clear I was\nA bad thing is that is is that if the moment American intelligence that there's a lot more\nAbout this than they should their cars and for whatever reason or the president\nIs holding back has said it will be no that was instructive that was\nThat was that was I had to Leslie stall wise I I I'm being very cautious about this because it it's the middle east of John Bolton told me it's the middle east let's talk for just a moment about the um\nThe attorney had just real quick to point out you're listening to connected I noticed this was fascinating over the weekend Saudi Arabia turn\nThe temperature of putting out a statement are pushing back on what the president was was all about a price to pay and then later became her statement turning down\nThe temperature saying they were working with\nTurkey that was a fascinating twenty four hours\nIt is I it it's what's going on there with Jamie diamond dropping out and I don't know if ... going to go a it's a signal\nA of a great stress within the relationship but I Want to go back to the justice the idea that we would go back to the child separation is a disaster political and moral so I don't think it's going to happen but I think it underscores that we don't have real\nCommand at the OJ Middle East\nUnder scores that we don't have real\nCommand at the OJ the leadership there is fractured there's a story in the Washington Post and again about Rod Rosenstein conquering hero at the Washington Reagan ball I think we're going to get a new attorney general after the election I think it's going to be Michael ... have you heard anything about this\nAs there are people who say that that should have been the choice from getting 'em and I think that that is a good\nList and just the fact that we are talking about all this name\nThey give a turmoil that's coming in our government the likelihood\nIs you can see the speaker Pelosi Democrats controlling the house and then a couple of high level turnovers at\nThe administration like or to the top couple\nCabinet positions if you get the fence\nAnd attorney general turning over one more state and treasury what your top tier\n... but the good news is Bolton and ...\nAre are meeting every week along with general Madam Secretary of defense Mattis and I think the national security establishment Gina Haspel Dan Coats and NSA is it's all very very stable um want to conclude though with a historical reference\nThere was a period of time in British politics a period of reform Eighteen thirties uh where everything was Kathy ... to overthrow the Lord's mad that break down and expand the franchise just all chaos\nI think we're in that period Mike and and and that the president\nIs just a symptom not the disease and the media thinks he's the disease and not a symptom blast or do you\nAgree thousand percent and I've written I've said that President Trump\nWas a reflection of friends that are in the country trends that are real trends that if you were pointing out the media's failed to listen to you talk to voters in Trump country about how they feel about Washington and the government it predates Trump and they are right about a lot of things they say\nAnd we will find out a lecture night how much that intense they might gallon from actually has great acts Monday with Michael our Monday's with my thank you my friend\nI also love relief factor I
