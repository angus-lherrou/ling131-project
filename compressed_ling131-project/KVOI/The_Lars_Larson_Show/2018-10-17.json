a no brainer flag makers just added\nA new star for every state I\nOut not that simple each new flag very careful design and the arrangement of the stars must be precise symmetric [noise]\nFor the flag we know today that arrangement was designed by a junior in high school from us\nThat arrangement was designed by a junior in high school from Ohio [noise]\nIt was Nineteen fifty eight in America only contain forty eight United States flag at the time featured six rows of eight star\nBob past history teacher assigned a class project where each student had to bring in something they may\nNot have my facts then he loves politics\nSo having been inspired by the Betsy Ross story the class just study in the in the news that Alaska was poised to become our nation's forty nine states with Hawaii soon behind has decided to make a fifty star flag\nSo he made some adjustments to his parents forty eight star flag brought it in and triumphantly placed it on his teacher's desk\nHere's Bob\nIn American history class we had to do it outside of class project we can make a new whatever we want it as like a science fair or something like that bring a project in the Betsy Ross story are intrigued me\nAnd my mom and dad or they had a forty eight star like they received for the wedding present which of course meant a lot to them well I took a sister\nAnd cut it up past smother walked in from the kitchen and found him cutting up their family flag and promptly began scolding him\nShe told his father when he got home and has received another tongue lashing I'd always been in the boy scouts and I had always been patriotic have told the Lancaster eagle is that in two thousand seven they wanted to know why I Would turn on the flag\nI had never shown in my life watched my mom so but I never soon and sense making the flag of her country I've never so and again so anyhow we get the class I had my flag on the teacher's desk and the teacher said watch this thing on my desk and so I got up and I approached a desk and I'm shaking like elite\nAnd he said why you've got too many stars you don't even know how many states we have\nAnd that he gave me the great of a B minus now that would be mine isn't that bad of a great however a friend of mine gym he picked up five leaves off the ground he's taping these leaves down to the new book in layman elm hickory maple\nTo understand everything that was going on\nAnd take a call like in my strike\n\nThat was on a relatively good day at the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp in Nineteen forty two in the words as the only known person to ever ever volunteer to be a prisoner there his name\nWas vetoed Polanski\nThey told ... family going back as far as his great grandparents were foreigners in the side of the SARS regime in Russia which at occupy Poland along with Austria Hungary and pressure since the Seventeen Ninety\nBecause of their opposition to the tyranny of theirs are associated the family was exiled seven hundred miles to the northeast of St Petersburg Russia\nSo for several generations this polish family was not on pulley saw or they were exiled survivors are to a place that they were completely unfamiliar with Polanski himself was born in Russia in a small village called all and that's\nBut he always felt that Poland was his home and would someday be his home\nIn Nineteen eighty when World War one came to a close\nPoland was a re carved as a country and re feared on the maps and the first time in a hundred and twenty three years but it needed ... the Russians under the new regime of flooding Marilyn and and as both cervix invaded Poland they did not want to give it up so to secure polish independents that\nAt least for the moment was on paper\n... while he was still a teenager in so many other brave polls had to\nPick up arms against the ... and in a three year war they were successful and expelling them and London had to bring the troops back home so it wasn't until Nineteen Twenty one that you could say Poland had indeed secured its independence as a nation for the first time\nSo ... settled down and raised a family and painted [noise]\nThere was no indication that Poland's independence was going to be threatened again only in the late Nineteen thirties says Hitler began to rattle a saver doesn't it seem as though there could be yet another war\nBut still on the evil and lots of people didn't see it coming we had the Munich Agreement that was agreed to in September of thirty eight that basically said hey everything's fine that we have to deal with Hitler and as long as he doesn't go any further uh there'll be peace in the world so\nThere was a long period of almost Twenty years when Poland was free of conflict and they've came on them with\nGreat ferocity when the Nazis and faded from the west and the Soviets\nA couple of weeks later he made it from the east in September of Nineteen thirty nine\nThere was tremendous resistance from the polls on only the polish army but an underground resistance to the rose pretty quickly so the Nazis and the Soviet never had a quiet day\nPolls were have always been courageous people who don't take tyranny lying down and they've resisted in every way imaginable does Polanski was one of them along with another gentleman he cofounded a resistance movements and\nVery bravely [noise]\nIn Nineteen forty after years of fighting ... realize that something was going on as a sprawling complex near crack I'll pull itself would become known as the outfits concentration camps wasn't yet the notorious death camp with Suzie come\nBut ... and his men to realize that many people were being taken they're not just Jewish people and they wanted to know\nWhat's happening there and they felt that or whatever it was the world needs to know about it so Polanski volunteers to get arrested five of Germans in the hope that they wouldn't shooting that they would in fact send him to outfits\nAnd of course there was no guarantee that they wouldn't simply kill him on the spot\nAnd no guarantee that they would send them to outfits\nThere were a periodic round up by the German polish citizens and in one particular round up some two thousand or he simply walked into it and was one of those two thousand people arrested by the Germans\nAnd he did not supply his proper identity papers she had the forged ahead of time and that was largely to protect his family did not want\nHis name or his activities will be traced back and make them the objects of any reprisals by the Nazis\nDid veto holds wife know about and approve of him doing all of the\nSheen fully supportive what he was doing knowing full well what an enormous risk it was probably expected to never see him again but he got his wish and after an interrogation and being rushed up he was sentenced to ... he was ... in may number forty eight fifty nine\nPolanski knew what he was sentenced there than it was a place of no good but it would be the next two to three years went outfits really blossomed into this ghastly concentration camp\nThat the world now knows upwards of two million people ultimately would be killed al ... [noise]\n\nI'm sure that Polanski has to think long and hard about how to get information out I mean he was stealing documents along with others that he recruited into his movement whenever they could\nA movement that he built up to more than one is now an insurrection died off [noise]\nAnd then they had to find some way to get them out there were a hundred and forty one people\nWho did manage to escape and some of those were people that Polanski had recruited and he was sending material with them\nBut Polanski the OSCE which volunteered didn't try to escape\nYou had more work to do\nThere was a time in Nineteen forty two when Polanski and some of his closest confidant in the resistance movement were able to rebuild the remnants of a radio transmitter with very spare parts and things that they could find around the camp\nTo the point where they were actually able to broadcast and for about a six month period they were broadcasting from this crude radio transmitter from inside outfits when you're measuring hundreds and hundreds of guards on watch fully armed at any moment\nWhen they were in power to shoot us I suspect that anything and yet this man and his men were able to get information out those reports along with the\nDocuments he smuggled out and the testimony from people who escaped became known as the told to report the most comprehensive eyewitness accounts\nEver compiled of the happenings inside the outfits concentration camp [noise] I'm\nAnd the outfits concentration camp [noise] I'm\nSure that the polish resistance had to find that incredibly inspiring to think of one of their own was on the inside and was getting this information out there that was reaching the capitals of the allies Asians and this happened to be an incredibly [noise] his racial thing to them [noise]\nJust imagine if the opposite was the case if they'd never heard anything from it if no information was getting out [noise] that would have been tremendously demoralizing\nWould have said hey there's no hope\nBut the fact that he was active and busy and hadn't given often was getting this information to be a great inspiration [noise]\nTo be told what his report had on his part\nWas over one hundred pages long and reported that where he was was like another planet\nThere were sterilization experiments going on there were three criminal tore up with the gas chambers that we're able to burn eight thousand people daily at one point he writes about some recently murdered Jews quote from the new transports over a thousand a day work gap\nBritish officials receive this report and found it so shocking that they didn't believe in thing to themselves and why would the Germans who shot and star Jews on a daily basis put in all this effort they thought it was an exaggeration from a desperate for some\n... was seeking more help from the allies [noise] it was what they found a reporter way to know that there was no indication\nAs to which reliability\nThe Nazi hookers reports seriously [noise] they just didn't know it was [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to continue with the story of the tone Polanski [noise] and by the way we tell these stories for an important reason a recent survey found\nThat two thirds of millennials don't\nKnow what House with his it's unimaginable for and that's why we do these stories and why we partner with the U.S the Shoah foundation to broadcast they're incredible archive\nOf fifty five thousand video testimony from survivors witnesses and perpetrators of the Holocaust course it was a governor [noise] did you know the Germans and when we come back\nMore a veto Polanski story here on our American story\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in like\nThe imitation of Christ\nPolanski was a devout Catholic the very end\nOn the day of execution in May of Nineteen forty five may twenty five in fact his last words were recorded as long live\nFree Poland and that certainly was the model by which he lived his life from the day he joined the polish army at the age of Seventeen the man was absolutely fearless and totally committed he endured unspeakable cruelty and hardships\nAnd all because he wanted his country to be free free free forward invasion free from a tyrannical government since even though we had a family to think about\nOr his first love I think was freedom for not only his family but all of his native country of Poland and I have just enormous respect for that\nAfter World War two with Poland being a communist country now governed by a puppet\nSoviet regime really\nThe story of Polanski was suppressed\nAnd the reason was the polish communist government knew that you couldn't tell the story the full story of the told Polanski\nWithout revealing what he had done after the time that he resisted the Nazi so they they would have loved to have had the story told\nOf what he had done to resist the German\nBut of course everybody was then asked what what did he do afterwards and then you'd have to tell the story of the fact that he was against the tyranny of the Soviet Union to it was against the communist regime so instead of having any of that story being told they decreed that his very nice to not be spoken in public his own family\nWere advised by the government that they could be federalized wouldn't be penalize jail if they spoke of the top ... in public it wasn't until after Nineteen eighty nine in the liberation of POWs from the communist yolk\nThat finally it was no longer illegal to speak of veto Polanski\nOn march ... two thousand sixteen Larry Reid got the opportunity of a lifetime visiting with Polanski sun\nIt was apparent during our conversation that even though\nHe suffered the loss of his father a all these years later he seemed to be a a a man content and and happy and when I asked him why are you happy or something of that affect his response was\nBecause my father's story is now becoming known\nIn great job on that out is always and thanks to Larry Reid and his book by the way real heroes is terrific forty stories about forty different heroes and it's available on Amazon dot com\nAnd we tell this story for a reason because first ten million polish Americans know it more than likely or should and there are Seventy million Catholics in this country and we also tell us because well we know the power of God\nAnd how to ... feet and drive out God anytime they can and we can tell that story the
