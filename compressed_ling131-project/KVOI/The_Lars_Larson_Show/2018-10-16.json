speaking about his single leader of the band in Nineteen Ninety One I think I could\nBecause what that meant to my father and to me\nThere's no way I could quantify that or even explain it um my father passed away over ten years ago now and\nHe he got to hear that song he got to see this enjoyed the successor that saw\nPeople were calling him on the phone and interviewing him his last days\nYou know who is this man seat of the band\nAnd he just he loves that and I loved that cause I respected him so much and he gave me everything I Am really my mother and he we're both musicians in\nThe idea of being a living legacy is really the truth\nI don't think I'll ever be as accomplished musician as he was\nBut um I've had a different gift came to me in a different way I've been able to reach in touch people through sauce [noise]\nAnd that one is probably touched more people more deeply than anything I've ever done\nAnd by the way don't we all want to have our sons and daughters speak that way about us again that's why we do these stories folks but you don't hear him anywhere else\n... music was powerful and its simplicity you didn't rely on the volume of his voice to convey as motions instead they came through in the soft tender delivery and he's amazing we're\nYear's Ryan explaining where the book's title came from\nIn the late Nineteen thirties there was a British literary critic name's Sheryl Connelly and he had never really been successful himself as a writer or he desperately wanted to he knew many successful writers you'd actually gone to school at George Orwell\nAnd so he wrote this book is a book of literary criticism and and basically it's premises how many of the books that my friends are writing that I Am trying to write that any writers publishing ... how many of them will be around in ten years\nHe felt like ten years was the mark of literary greatness\nIn the industry we recall any book that lasts for more than a year or two we called them perennial write a book that's lasted for ten years would be a very big success but\nThe irony is if you pull up or the New York times best seller list and you go to the the fine print at the bottom it says among the categories not actively track this time our perennial seller so there's this term\nWe know that these books that that last and last and yet most of our focus in the industry whether we're making books or music or movies is about new things\nIt was in two thousand Fifteen actually for the first time in the music business that catalog albums officially out sold new releases\nAnd so we know that the things that were made a long time ago if you think of many of your favorite books and movies and TV shows and restaurants many of them are not brand new it's actually the ones that have really stood the test of time that we returned to over and over again\nAnd yet it it's strange where most of the energy in these industries go and so what's so fascinating about cereals connelly's sort of journey as\nHe's writing about this but then can he actually do it right you know he's writing a book about creating lasting enduring work well\nI I was fascinated by the idea of like could could you actually do it with the sort of like a literary Babe Ruth could he hit the ball where he set out to to hit it where he pointed and told the crowd or the picture that he was going to hit it\nAnd the book it it it never became a sort of a massive\nCultural trendy sensation\nBut it did endure you know it it was published in Nineteen thirty seven and then in ... through a World War three political revolutions through bad divorces\nNew fashioned styles massive technological disruption and so many other things that if it was given a second edition ten years later so Nineteen forty seven or Nineteen forty eight it was published\nAnd then in two thousand eight it was published in its third edition and it's still reading today and and here I Am\nTalking to to you guys about it and so it's a book that's outlived him and almost everything else published at that time it's earned the author a cult like following among fellow writers and creative\nAnd I think what's so impressive is that he set out to achieve this thing and he and he did it he has another quip you said you know I like my my work to outlive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how how many books\nAnd projects that creative kill themselves to make\nAnd how femoral most of them are\nJames solitaire is one of my favorite novelists I was reading one of his books not long ago and on the back which wouldn't it wouldn't have been written by him but it it described his novels is having a sort of him perishable freshness and I I just love that idea I I Love the idea of making something\nPerennial something\nIn perishable something that stands the test of time\nAnd by my goodness when we're watching Shawshank Redemption on TV or the godfather for Ninety it's time we know we're watching perennials right and they give us more satisfaction in so much of the new stuff that we know who's going to be old stuff really fast\nHere's Ryan sharing some stories from his own background that prompted them to create books and other work the stands the test of time\nI've always had this lifelong fascination with things that were old when I was a teenager everything I liked was all my favorite bands\nHad released their albums decades before I was born um they were still going strong by the time I came around I I remember picking up the great Gatsby in high school and thinking how incredible it is that this book that was written to be a critique of the Jazz Age right it was a timely periodical\nCould've into it and and somehow been so so timeless and and true even to a a random high school or in California you know sixty plus years later and\nMy first job as a writer I was a research assistant to an author named Robert Green wrote a book called the forty eight laws of power this was a book that didn't hit the best seller lists until a decade after it had come out and and yet quietly and slowly it sold more than a million copies and been translated into dozens\nOf languages I I Would guess that in a a hundred years from now people would still be reading it um another book that I worked on you know got a Seventy five hundred dollar advance which is tiny advances what they call a kiss off advance and the industry\nMeaning that the the lowest amount of money they can give you without hurting their feelings and they hope he'll go away and that book went on a cell over a million and a half copies and and you know now ten years after its release it sells about\nThree hundred copies a week and I I went on as a marketer became the director of marketing and American Apparel and\nIt was interesting that that this company which will hundreds of millions of garment every year the best selling items worthy items created at the beginning of the company's trajectory it was\n... and they had this mission of making making things that would be sold in Vinton shops in the future and I I just love this idea of making things\nThat can laugh with with my own books you know perhaps the readers haven't haven't heard of me or they certainly wouldn't have seen me on the New York times best seller lists are for the most part\nAnd yet quietly and and like clockwork they sell about five\nThousand copies across the various titles that every single week in the marketing for them has long since\nFinished and yet you know surprise uh one of my books did appear on a best seller list last week\nA year after it had come out and so is this idea of making things that resonate with people\nThat really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as a creative would have been what to expect when you're expecting because every day in every part of the world\nA couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and\nOld or a couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and so I'm I'm fascinated by that kind of work the the work that indoors and it it saddens me that so much work that is made doesn't indoor and so I was fascinated by this question of sort of what similarities\nDo these works have in common and I set out I interviewed a all sorts of of authors and editors and producers and\nA marketers and entrepreneur is and and I tried to get to the bottom of what makes\nThings laugh than I you know I found a few things I think first does that work needs to be unique if it it's very hard for it to endure if it is not definitive if it if it doesn't stand out stand alone and yet on the other hand\nIt should do a very simple job I didn't want them one of my editors said to me one time she said Ryan it's not what a book is\nIt's what a book does and by that she meant it has to do something for the leaders not necessarily about what it does for the creator it's about what it does so what to expect when you're expecting it it helps you with this difficult\nTime in your life and and I think that's what the best\nThe best work does you know it's this this question this is a blank\nThat does blank for black if you can't fill those in as a creator you're going to have a lot of trouble I I was\nInterested in the test that max Martin one of the greatest songwriters certainly the most prolific and popular signs of all time it's written for everyone from Celine Dion a back street boys to Bon Jovi Taylor Swift and\nHis subjects his music to what he calls the car test you get that his car in Los Angeles\nAnd I put the top down it puts it on the stereo and he drives up and down the Pacific coast highway is the music adding to that experience that the idea that even use it is designed to really do something for the audience is something I think\nThat people ... and and so that that's an essential part of this sort of creative process\nAnd when we come back more from Ryan Holiday on his book perennial seller and my goodness what a fascinating question what makes things last not just starts products maybe even a marriage [noise]\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nWhat a pain it was to market his books you said I feel like a wretched employee of my former herself my former self being the happily engage novelist who now sends me a kind of salesmen out on the road to walk this book he's out all the fun writing it and I'm the or bastard who has to sell it but\nMaking art for a living as a privilege and one of the obligations of that privileges dust the selling a there's a line from Peter Till the founder of pay pal he said if you don't see any sales people in your organization than your the sales person\nWho's going to pitch your work if not you right who's going to sell this than if you're not interested in selling it and so that's what I\nEnded up telling a lot of creative there's no magical from that you can hire there's no magical button you can press there's no magical media outlet even being on this wonderful show isn't going to guarantee that my book perennial seller is going to\nFind all the people who are interested in finding it and so if you're not going to do it who will Peter drunk or the management expert he said that each project need someone\nWho says I'm going to make this succeed and then goes to work and does it that that has to be you know so I push create is to think of marketing and not even as an obligation but as a a central part of the creative process can you be as creative\nIn your media appearances in your marketing in your ways of getting customers as you were in writing every page or you know developing the\nUh the vintage of wine that you're you're selling or the the boots that you wanted to produce right how can that be as much of it of a canvas to paint on to make something special as\nAs the than you you made itself and a lot of creative fail at this I mean the the the shelves grown with on watched movies and on read books and\nYou know our phones are filled with downloaded music and podcast that will never get around to see an end to that urgency that sense of I've got to make people care about this is really the essential task of the writer or the creative of any kind you know if you build it\nThey will not come that is not how it works you have to make them you have to invite them one by one it until the crowd is full until the ... the seats are filled and that's why you did this work\nIn the first place right certainly no one slaves away on some creative or artistic project purely for their own satisfaction or otherwise why would they have ever released it in the first place and so\nThat idea of of taking ownership of it is the difference I think between something that sells five copies and some and it's almost five million copies and I think every artist would rather whether they admit it or not reach five million people than five\nAnd there you have it Ryan Holiday his new book perennial seller centrally answering the question what makes things last from products or\nFrankly to marriage\nOr anything else you care about in your wife [noise]\nBy the way I Love the line son important what a book is about\nTo support it's important

pursuit of criminal enterprise it\nEspecially the bashing growing international cartels have drugs in cyber crime and the gathering men is thousands of spies with new tools of astonishing capability\nWe are a nation at risk new attorney general\nTo know how to act in response introduced within the rule of law\nThe national security team around the president is at least the equal of any

I encourage you to send it around people that ... that there is a David Brooks column\nAnd I don't usually do long read but this column is amazing\nEvery few years what research group or another produces type apology of the electorate researchers conduct thousands of interviews and identify the different clusters American voters fall into writes Brooks in this morning's New York times\nMore in common has just completed such a tight apology it's one of the best I've seen because it understand that American politics has no longer about what health care plan you support\nIt's about identity psychology moral foundation and the dynamics of tribal resentment\nThe report kitten tribes breaks America into seven ... from left or right\nWith names like traditional liberals moderates politically disengaged and so on\nThey won't surprise you to learn that the most active groups are on the extremes progressive activists on the last eight percent of Americans and devoted conservatives on the right six percent I think that's me\nThese two groups are the richest of all the groups that white is a bit of both left and right\nThere members have among them the highest education levels and they report high levels of personal security\nAnd we sometimes think of this as a populist moment but that's not true my first big takeaway from hitting tribes he's our political conflict is primarily a rich white civil war it's between privileged progress ups and privilege conservatives amen you could say that tribalism is the fruit a privilege\nPeople with more stressors in their lives necessarily pay less attention to politics people with college degrees are more likely to describe their ideology is central to their identity\nThey are much more likely to derive moral meaning from their label more likely to fill it with a herd based on that label and more likely to vote the party line\nBy second big takeaway from the report that ideas really do drive history progressive activists and devoted conservatives organize around coherent philosophical narratives these narratives art visions of a just society there the narratives of men is about who needs to be exercise from society [noise]\nDevoted to subscribe to Hobbs the narrative the dangerous world life is nasty British some short\nWhen he'd strict values and strong authority to keep us safe David Brooks doesn't say so but

great I just got a mind boggling eighty six percent devoted conservatives thinking is more important for children to be well behaved and creative only Thirteen percent of progressive activists agree\nBecause well behaved children become well behaved adults and productive progressive activists on the other hand subscribe to the dark and ... world view people may be inherently good that the hierarchical structure to society are off all the structures and inequality and oppression and have to be dismantled\nNinety One percent of progressive activists say sexual harassment is common Raleigh twelve percent of devoted conservatives agree Ninety two percent of progressive activists say people don't take racism seriously enough compared to six percent of devoted conservative eighty six percent of progressive activists say\nOr send a devoted conservative eighty six percent of progressive activists say life outcomes are outside of people's control\nOnly two percent of devoted concerns agree that's that's me man you are in charge of your life\nProgressive activists are nearly three times as likely to say they are ashamed to be an American as the average voter while this philosophical disputed not do new Brooks continues they've always been some people who thought that we need hierarchical structure to keep us safe and others that we need to be a map submitted from oppressive structure so we can be free\nWhat is new cultivation this dispute has become\nThe researchers asked a wide variety of questions on everything from child rearing their national anthem protests in many cases Ninety seven and nine nine percent of progressive activists said one thing in Ninety three Ninety five percent of dedicate a concert or said the opposite\nThere's little evidence of individual thought just called conformity the current situation really does begin to look like the religious wars that ripped through Europe after the invention of the printing press except our new religions where pagan political guard that's not true entirely\nThe good news is that once you get outside of the ... group she found a lot more independent thinking and flexibility is not a fifty fifty nation only appears that way when disenchanted voters are forced to choose between two extreme cults roughly two thirds of Americans across for political types fall into what they call the exhausted majority sixty one percent of it and say\nWe need to listen and compromise eighty percent said political correctness is a problem\nEighty two percent say the same thing about hate speech\nUnfortunately people in the exhausted majority have no narrative they have no coherent philosophical rural due to organize their thinking and compel action yesterday it was called Christianity when they get one I suspect it will look totally unlike the two dominant narrative today these narratives are threatened narratives but the people who make positive change usually focused on gifts not deficits\nThey will tell stories about the assets we have and how we can use them together agree\nI don't know what the next political paradigm will look like but I bet it will be based on abundance not deficits gifts not fear hope not hatred\nI agree but part of this has to begin\nWith the absolute exiled from political authority of the progressive lap because it is so damn dangerous\nDo not
