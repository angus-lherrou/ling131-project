Daily Beast published a story well then walking Castro issued a statement saying that he did not intend to use your Christian or orchestrating the killing of democracy do you I mean but I did\nHow do you not in tune you say well Jared Kushner gave him a hit list and say to these people I didn't mean to imply that he gave him his listens to these people but you said it but I didn't apply it no you you would literally said it\nYeah it does the exact word but I didn't apply it was an implied literally it was more than that you set it [laughter] that's harder than an implication oh my gosh\nHe was and him can you imagine him and his brother their mom founded ... she was a co founder of La Raza\nThey're crazy oh my gosh\nI don't even know if they do we know if it was never fully on I don't even know maybe that's\nWhy they got good night\nNo the ah who early on was the one who gave the twenty twelve keynote and that's one room and I had said even then I said they're going to try to groom him watch it I said it years ago I've always had my I had my eye on them for years\nSo I'm telling you and his brother's us rat\nHolding on cash or is the former mayor and it was at that San Antonio river walk that they switched him out I still since my favorite one of my favorite stories out of politics\nAnd walking like arguing or would that we look alike and people were going and they were screaming at what they thought was who they're and Castro but he had gone to a fundraiser he dropped out he goes to them well it is it goes to you know if you put your identical twin and your place maybe not and then he put ... to waving everybody neck like he was his twin brother\nAnd then he he ... walking Castro say well they were yelling at me and I was going back no it's well keen\nBut that nobody believes that [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] oh man I Would have thought I was there as a foreign policy analysis oh my word but yeah that he's they are legit the\nThey are the uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez equivalent\nAs who they are [noise]\nMan so that's just if you if you ask questions and apparently you are conducting a whisper campaign and then you have the story a you have what ... you were spinning and this\nAnd there are some here a couple of other questions that I'm really curious about and I think it's worth asking\nWhy I think that these are nobody nobody wants to really ask any of these questions so power line had a great\n... a write up of this and I think that\nAgain it's not a whisper campaign when you're trying to find out information\nFor instance there was a there's German media were saying that he was actually not just a journalist that he was actually secretly this activist or or this operative\nAnd that he was a because of his association with the Muslim Brotherhood this was a German media was reporting via PJ Media that uh and he was in Islam is that he wanted to replace the Saudi monarchy with a modern Islam is totalitarian state\nAnd that he was bitterly opposed to their ah approach to the state of Israel and he backed up he backed Palestinian and transient intransigence which we know it back Palestinian cause he tweeted moisture America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nSo we know that that's not even up for debate that came I actually had the tweet saved so he uh that was from his Twitter account so\nThe center for security policy dug into it and was looking at you know there's a lot there there's there that's why there's so much caution being used in drawing conclusions about all of this because the intel establishment I just don't trust some of the information that's coming from it and I definitely don't trust Iranian apologist so\nI mean I don't know if they're exaggerating I don't know if that's\nOff it is but here's the thing if he was a Middle East operative wind the world would you have why would the Washington Post hire him\nNew York times this is what I'm ... the New York times said about cars showed him\nQuote after a successful career as an advisor to an unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia he had been barred from writing in the kingdom even on Twitter by the new crown prince\nSo in the United states he reinvented himself as a critic contributing Collins to the Washington Post Palin asks why would the post enable a former spokesman for the Saudi royal family to reinvent himself I contributing columns\nThe New York times described him as a quote political Islam is to quote forged a personal bond with President ... ... of turkey why would the post to use as a columnist and Islamic Powell over here to one\nAnd the New York times also added that according to show the zone friends he had joined the Muslim Brotherhood they said that he had stopped attending Brotherhood meetings but acknowledged that he quote remained calm conversant and its conservative Islam is in Austin anti western rhetoric which he could deploy or high depending on whom he was seeking to befriend in quote\n\nThat was the New York times that was ... by the way that wasn't and I have the link to destroy right here it it ran just on the fourteenth\nSo that's not conservative media carrying out a whisper campaign that the New York times to their credit legit asking some questions or or putting some information out there and a lot of individuals are wondering well then why did the why why would the Washington Post hire this\nGuy\nI think it's a good question why would they hire him and just that right there by itself makes it\nA lot more complicated than just the crown prince wrote a couple of columns by some duty didn't like and decided to kill him\nI mean let's look at this from another angle if the crown prince was aware and I seriously I'm Sorry but I just highly doubt that his that people if people within his inner circle were involved I just highly doubt that those individuals acted rogue\nI've just really don't believe that they did and if so why would he go to this drastic\nTake this drastic undertaking and bills is links to kill a guy in broad daylight when you know there's cameras everywhere he goes in\nConsulate ... he goes to the Saudi Arabian constantly and turkey and its stand ball and then you know what are your other who is always with you know the crown prince ... he goes in there shortly after\nThat's pretty brazen now you could say it's because he just really doesn't care I don't think it's because he really doesn't care because he has gone on his charm offensive for the past several months I think that there's at some point he thinks that I think that I I I Do think that to a ... a particular\nExtent there is\nTo it particular extent I think he he doesn't care about repercussions he just kind of shrugged it off\nBut\nI think that after this charm offensive there's more than than just\nHe's you know punch drunk on power\nThere's more to it than us because you don't go to this you don't go to this the fact that this length go all over the United states and you know show how you're really getting a unveiling reforms women are driving your rolling back\nSome of your your other regulations on you know say Christianity and other things and you're you're really taking a stand against Iran you say you support a\nA ... the state of Israel I mean that's huge in the Arab world in that region that's huge\nSo why would you go to that Lincoln have all of that carefully orchestrated to screw up like this was there a sense of urgency where's there's something else happening I mean that's one of the world led to that and I think that's the big question\n\nBut this idea from the media that this is a conservative whisper campaign is really stupid because this is the New York\nTimes that we're saying that he actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood New York times isn't a conservative publication they hate me for crying out loud there aren't profile I mean I actually like the reporter I thought she was much more professional\nThan some of the other local not jobs who've tried to do pieces on me and end up writing fans thick\nAnd talking to people that you haven't seen since third grade but okay um but they're not even though they're biased and they make mistakes I don't think they're going to run something like that unless it was the worst\nThat's it and then on the conservative publication so power that that's a narrative saying that it's a whisper campaign\nAnd I'm not saying that oh well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood so that means he has to die what I'm saying is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in a way of asking the bigger questions\nWhy would the crown prince gamble all of everything and he has built and his reputation as a reformer and do all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe as the New York times had written that he was an Islamist here's associate with the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd he was apparently working to have and Islam is a fair or unfair authoritarian state to replace the Saudi monarchy\n\n\n\n\nCriticism from town hall dot com contact from

bugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel this isn't real reforms is more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million we're starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nWell that and the and that would make sense the New York times had a piece a just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know show these friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he very much expressed Arab anti western sentiments and he was a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted and the charm offensive\nBy the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors after you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you was whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of um a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS is no more real reformers in showbiz according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago because she'll get was writing about how the caliphate\nIs real the Muslim Brotherhood should be given time to evolve in the bottom line it's\nA majority of critic of approach to the ... if you will and that's not liberal democracy and I have to tell you I did my five cats so that'll air this weekend on the show gave a reformed best is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they're lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or violating human rights of people that are American residents or alone and I said what the Saudis should do they really want the ... for what they did to this man\nReleased rate better we relieve release the lead up all the attorney that has been in jail for defending rape better we we have called for the release of tons of prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islamic lobby in Washington\nA got assassinated and now all of a sudden they care what the ... you have a niece who were being massacred by the Saudis now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the ... for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this is just the I mean the reality is is that\nUh we should change the way we're approaching hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balanced against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now then between the ministers of foreign affairs in Syria and Iran and turkey that are cheering on uh the the decrease in the stability between the American Saudi relationship\nAnd and and that would explain why all of a sudden it as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence the previous presidents silence and all of these dissidents and uh and individuals that you name too are wrongly imprisoned\nOr they haven't really said anything about them the or the previous administration silence on it\nUm but and this and those are all the same people that were attacked everyone else that wanted to end that safe to deal with Iran they seem to the apologies for Iran and I see them feeding in exploiting the situation as a way to try to position I ran a little bit better do you see the same\nAbsolutely and that's the whole thing if you look at the the Ben Rhodes uh uh uh you know friends are what are they doing they're trying to find any way possible to resurrect an Obama legacy that wasn't the vote beating a terrorist state Iran that\nWas feeding a genocide in Syria and elsewhere to sort of resurrect stumped type of stumbling of of rationality wished there wasn't any\nOf the Obama carry approach and now if you see secretary palm pale trying to rebuild the relationship with the Saudis and tell them what's going to come if they show a picture of him smiling then all of a sudden that becomes a bizarre a photo op went inspect Carey was smiling with\nWith dictators tyrants in Iran and to Ron in Egypt and elsewhere and nobody thinks anything about that and it's just that\nWhere and nobody can say anything about that and it's just that beyond a double standard as to tell you\nIt breaks my heart as an American to see our values trampled on in the name of sort of revisionist history because all they're worried about the Democratic party legacy under Obama rather than actually the real values and and here you have a Washington Post editorial board putting out an op ed\nThing that we are trying to destroy a man's history and I sit on my pocket the virus to disappear tomorrow\nI Would hope that my critics what took you to be critical of me because it's dishonest to all of a sudden become lie and I think of somebody and lie about them after they die when in fact you're just altering their entire service in this guy's writing was anti Israel and the western\nHe was not part of the secular liberal democratic movement of the middle east is just the ...\nYeah last question for you Dr ... and we're talking to doctors Energizer here on and where we appreciate your time so I mean obviously we ... we can't have allies or or a at any one with whom we are associated\nBehaving like that we don't want them to behave in a way where they're killing people in broad daylight and they really don't seem to worry about the repercussions of it how should the administration handled this with Saudi Arabia so as to not destabilize that relationship and then give Iran a leg up and ... and and further empower them\nI think we do a little more than we did for example the Russian and they use the chemical weapon and assassinated individual in the u._k. we basically told them number one we put sanctions against some of the wealthiest individuals in Saudi Arabia so that we have them pay a price where it hurts which isn't the oil industry\nNumber two we demand that they're released prisoners that we know we've been asking for their release Canada just had a conflagration with their foreign minister and the Saudis where they ask for rape better we will lead ... release\nThat you know what if you guys really didn't mean to do this then released these other prisoners so that you can at least show that you're heading towards some liberalization\nAnd third I think we hold them accountable with transparency into the future about not only human rights but about thing you know what we're going to stop doing the operations in Yemen a there are some American planes being used there I think we tell them that enough stuff do you know that we're not going to tolerate that any more of the third part of it\nRight now you know doctors any jazz are always such a pleasure to talk with you appreciate your expertise on this end up for bringing some for
