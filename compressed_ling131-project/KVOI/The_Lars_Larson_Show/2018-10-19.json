down and talk with his parents about anything important\nMy wife or their eyes wide open sat silently well we all got settled and to hear what he had to say\nI could not remember is approaching us like this before and my expectations coupled with my imagination made me feel very uncomfortable\nHe began to tell us about a friend whose cousin the tens of the New Mexico military institution\nIn

one of the reasons why he wants to leave these dangers maybe in\nAmong the many tomorrow's of his future [noise]\nIt was becoming a parent's me Tommy is not just running to someplace or running away

prospect of her son leaving home at sixteen she was unprepared and not happy about a separation so soon from Tommy\nOr other somebody had left for college a year earlier she thought she would have taught me for two more years\nThe idea of spending Twenty years as a mother and then watching them leave home is a painful experience for any mom\nBut his desire was so credible and so sincere that she can only say yes\nShe says she could not be so selfish as to stand in a way of her son seeking to make his life mattered sixteen she always said that she put her children first her commitment to that devotion\nPuts her and as a selfless position that our children feel is more important than how she feels\nSo she is preparing yourself what will be one of the most difficult sacrifices she can
