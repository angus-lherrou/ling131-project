Ortiz\nIn through or is that in fact bad polling Alfredo Ortiz\nNow you know I think that that is probably correct point and I think part of it is when when I look at people kind of forget when times were bad right that we had an unemployment rate that was about ten per se\nUm that we had the kneeling growth rate less than two percent of the Obama administration and they were at one point two percent or point three percent\nI'm an expert patients are we going to close out the year it over three percent right forget where they come and people forget that they're better off today than there

tried counting calories pills eating and eating and then more aiming\nYes absolutely and having just been in Kansas City doing some work on the book promoting it or something called the Edgar Snow foundation which has a longstanding decades long standing with China a part of it related to my alma mater the University of Missouri I met my many prominent Chinese officials who are in your in the United states in travel from China\nAnd they don't understand Trump and they kept pulling me aside can you explain Trump to us can you explain Trump to us I'm like I can offer you some general observations but this ambiguity component is important and Jared Kushner the president believing it obviously Henry Kissinger believes in it and it is\nPlaying itself out and the other component of the Saudi relationship I said there's something about Jared and his effectiveness with the Saudis early on that for something that maybe in America we don't appreciate enough and I'm not saying we should I'm just saying it's a factor that's real\nFamilies for his family were them that's more important than a lot of\nA modern grass that you published her citations you have an academic journals or degrees you've achieved or other titles that you've had your family their family they are held in higher esteem they believe dealing\nDirectly with a family member that gives Jared and I think when people talk about unappreciated aspect of how he can be effective I'm not saying that's the only part of it that would be disrespectful but I think it's important and sometimes overlook component\nNow and then you can function and he can ... success succeed\nOn time and major Garrett his brand new book Mr Trump's wild ride I just printed out people after he can actually very serious thought he's as well as great reporting that I ... I just not good reporting was coming I didn't think he'd actually\nDive into what is going on in the dynamic here I Want to go back to ... and ... yeah I've only met Jared watch out for about five seconds are introduced by Lighthizer somewhere I don't have any field for him I don't know how smart he is I don't know I gather is very smart I don't know how he uses his ambiguity\nBut what do you think he is a ... about ... because the the the Congress and vote Magnitsky yesterday and that's not an option I mean that's not we can't break off relations with the Saudis\nYou know we can't it's a very difficult situation and I don't know what happened we don't know what happened but no one feels good about it and each and every passing day we all feel worse about what probably happened and one of the things I point out in the book is that\nThe Trump Administration called was signals during the transition and the administration itself\nGave very strong signals to the Saudis that\nThey were as long as they were allied with us and reliably so and lots of issues Yemen financing for refugee relocation both in Jordan and Syria\nAre not picking up the cause of the Palestinians letting them know that look you're not the longer you wait a deal that you're going to get with the ... of administrations only gonna get worse so don't wait and don't expect us to save you all those issues give them a lot of latitude that latitude lead to a miscalculation here I don't know that is the deep fear\nWithin the administration that\nThere was a sense that they could do something like this\nAnd not suffer repercussions and that has got to be dealt with\nIf you don't have any interest I'm going to be talking later today with a senior ministry official about this but made you get I Want to go back to your book\nOr the White House press corps is not divided pretty clearly down the line and I put in to the people who read and think and those who simply shine who want to be on TV\nYou're a reader in a thinker mind I'm not saying that 'cause it's a nice thing about the radio show I appreciate that I didn't expect that when I read Mr Trump's wild ride but thank you but I'm Wondering if the White House is going to he's going to be able to map the Syrians people in the press corps and work with them\nTo communicate or not to propaganda but to communicate\nUh I'm certainly open to that uh I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that um but every everything\nFalls in politics and even with this administration which though because the president it because of his innate sense of confidence about himself approach things in a\nPretty ritualized fashion but ah if they're open I'm I'm always live literally always there and what I what I Hope from the from the book is that people will make exactly the conclusion you did that\nThis is a serious assessment of things that have actually happened and there's some thought and some deep reporting there and it's ...\nThey happen and there's some thought and some deep reporting there and it's believable and it's therefore\nUsed to everyone who is curious about this story\nThere's always a big story you\nKnow and I hear it's huge and the north Korea side of it uh let me conclude this way or you quote mad as soon as being the key player Derrick Christian or the key player we've also got secretary of state Pompeo and I'm ... ... ... of course at CIA Gina Haspel affair agent and Dan Cook is the strongest national security team\nAre they working together major Garrett or are they all pursuing different agendas and occasionally overlap\nNo I think in the main they're working together because the president's directives are very clear their unambiguous there are times when the president says things or imagine things or throws things into the mix sometimes simply\nTo provoke a reaction or to see what people say or do you think outside the box trust me he did that a lot and I think he's still does with Afghanistan I think he's ... devil about what to do in Afghanistan because\nIt just continues on and this sort of grinding way\nBut in the main America First means America First a national security strategy was put together in rapid fashion it was direct it was comprehensive it covered a lot of things\nPrevious national security documents didn't and that reflects the core beliefs of the core approach to this president and in that sense the signals are clear other times and the president sort of\nPut ... in the universe with is Rick and traits yes yeah for sure\nFor sure Mr Trump's wild ride is just must reading the thrill Joe screaming and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidents ...
