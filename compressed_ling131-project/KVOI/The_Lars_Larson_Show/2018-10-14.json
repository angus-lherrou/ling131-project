I've always had civil discussion with Brian I completely disagree with him on a number of things but I always appreciate the discussion\nBut he had said and you know we went back and forth on this a little bit\nBecause I was discussing how the\n... I replied to him he said President Trump is leading a hate movement against the press but it's not just against the press what stand up stands out of his rallies and he's quoting this piece of the New Yorker which is just a\nA really it is a too long the column of my space venting it's like somebody just discovered live journal the only thing that was missing as ... to\nCorrectly capture their fields at the time of writing\nAnd what they're listening to avoid it took it back to the nineties done it and he says\nHe says that he's a recording says well you know the president's leading the hate movement against the press you know et cetera et cetera or someone who watched his rallies on TV said oh they hate insensitive actual men is that he's trying to convey to his supporters\nAnd I wrote people chanting something at a rally hence the lock her up thing when they were talking about Feinstein and they're not going to go out and physically drag her from her home or run or out of a restaurant they'll go and vote that's what they do\nBut I said people chanting something at a rally is not comparable to stalking people in airports attacking them in their yards running them out of restaurants blocking traffic well damaging cars boxing families and shooting up a congressional ball game\nThat column is just plain silly he says well there's been a rise in political violence and outrageous behavior on both are right in the left do you think the leader of our country is helping to calm things down\n... well and that's when I said do you think that this began with this administration or are you purposely ignoring occupy\nBoston rioters paid by more to go to Ferguson weather underground and if he blames Trump and Hillary Booker and waters and holder and even Obama because by his logic they called for a violent and I added further if we're comparing\nI have witnessed and I have personally experienced way more threatening behavior from the left in the rye I don't think Republicans should rise to match the tone of people like Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton and I've always condemned when I've seen it happen\nAlways\nAnd he says well I don't doubt that you are right wing fixture folks on the left personally experienced more of it from the rye I Wish leaders would work to make things better not worse and said I don't know anyone on the left who had to move because of repeated conservative or Republican threat\n\nAnd I don't doubt that there absolutely people on the left who have endured similar but how often and how severe seems out measured\n[noise]\nYou know ... this is is [noise]\nI I I also hope it changes I mean that's that's the thing I also hope it changes but no no no I'm not going to I'm not going to be told that well it's both sides no it's not\n\nWell what about Charlottesville they say you mean the rally that was organized by a Democrat the guy who voted for Obama that racist tool bag\nHell yeah let's denounced that all day long I don't understand the point look here's the thing you can sit here in March with your tiki torches that you've got her Home Depot six words the Sunday I don't care I Believe in free speech even for people who speeches absolutely sounds like it's the product of incest I'm totally fine with that\nGo ahead and have your free speech your peaceful free speech\nYou meet speech you don't like with more speech\nThat's the thing you know someone who was um who\nWho knew someone who knew to the people that were there that were open carrying firearms there um apparently and this was when I was told by this individual who lives actually in Charlottesville they were saying that those people showed up not to like protect the um\nTiki torches people but to protect the counter protesters and not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't\nAnd not even because they agreed with them but because they they didn't want it to all get out of hand and they knew that that there probably wouldn't be enough resources there to stop it if it did\nAnd then you had somebody driving a car that was that a kill Heather higher which is horrible but it's like okay so Ann how was that attributed to Trump yeah\nAnd furthermore I Wish people would match my consistency or your consistency can't or other people's consistency none of these individuals that all whatsoever have condemned the stuff that Hillary Clinton has said\nOr Maxine Waters they refused outright to condemn antifa they have refused\nTo condemn the protests on college campuses where people ... people in the face and burned down buildings\nSo\nBefore you criticize why don't you match my consistency or other people's consistency\n...\nWhy don't they why don't they perhaps match it\n\nBut yeah the whole rally that was because that guy was a hardcore Democrat who voted for Barack Obama did the media tell you that no\n\nIs anybody surprised that a guy who came from the party that was that for him to the KKK would have a tiki torches rally in Charlottesville is anybody surprised at that don't believe me go Google at Washington Post wrote about it\nGood heavens yes it's horrible but\nI Wonder if the people who are making a big deal out of it if they'll condemn it lasts and rightfully should be if they'll condemn it less because it was somebody of their own ideology that didn't that organized it\nThat's the thing it's all awful\nSo what right does that give you to say the stuff that you're saying well right does it give it when this is this idea that\nUh\nSome I mean just I'm so tired of people are just like well you know which justify what we're doing what about when somebody made an effigy of Obama and set it on fire yeah that was that was stupid and I said the same thing when I was at a rally and I saw less is make an effigy of Bush and set on fire to\nAn your point which your point\nYou want to do this you know south measuring what about as a BS all day or you can actually condemn the people that are shooting a congressional ball fields that are volunteering for the candidates who voted for\nOr how it this maybe maybe you're going to say Hillary Clinton the person that uh you know the other person I voted for maybe she shouldn't say things like we're not going to be civil until we have power\nOr Maxine Waters you're a Democrat lawmaker maybe she shouldn't say go and find them where they are and make them uncomfortable\nRun them out of the country or what about soccer or what about I mean I could go on and on what about antifa\nWhat about the
