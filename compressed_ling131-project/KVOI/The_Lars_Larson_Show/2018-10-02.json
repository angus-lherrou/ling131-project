twelve take on well this guy runs those solo\nDean has also written multiple books including ultra marathon man confessions of an all night runner and his latest the road to Sparta reliving the ancient battle an effort run than fired the world's greatest what race and dean thanks so much for joining us\nI was just listening there that I Need to take a run\nThe guy just listening mated action I think I Need to take a run [laughter] oh dear yeah I don't have a beer Enron yeah\nBefore we get into your running and other accomplishments we love to talk to almost everybody who walked through the store for all of our interview process where were you born tell us about your parents and one of the things in childhood that you think she you to become the guy you are today\nI was born in Los Angeles so California born and raised a I'm a hundred percent of Greeks I'm from a ... a great grandparents\nUm [noise] I remember running home from kindergarten when I was six years old I was the oldest child and when we had my my youngest sister I said we've got a I've got a brother who's a little bit younger than me and my sister I remember my mom and having a hard time getting me home from school\nAnd my dad was working two jobs so I just said mom you don't have to worry about getting me home and she said well how are you going to get home\nAnd I said well I'm going to run home and I remember really enjoying running I remember sitting in the classroom or just waiting for the ... you know what young kid especially a boy\nWants to sit still and pay attention I mean a young boy wants to run around and go wild and I remember sitting there in that classroom to ... you know counting down in a moment to tell the bell rang and then running home\nDean I still don't want us to fill in the attention so you know\nI think that's all right yeah\nAnd so tell me this you you you then start to I guess do it all boys do would you increase the challenge just step it up a little bit more talking about how that happened increasing your distance as as a kid\nWell there's this idea of never stop exploring and in running it's very symbolic Iran I ran a marathon when I was fourteen years old so that's you know twenty six point two miles\nAnd I thought maybe it was the furthest that anyone could ever run a and then I heard about people running further than that and I I\nCouldn't believe it I heard about a fifty mile foot race and I thought that's impossible human being can't run continuously for fifty miles I got to try it so I signed up in Iran fifty miles and you know at the fifty mile races walk ... qualified\nYou know her right it is a home or\nUm you know how do you live up a ... to to those sort of expectations I think a lot of Greeks have have just quietly I'm done remarkable things um they haven't been both live in they maintain a real element of humility you and there's always been this entrepreneurial spirit\nI get a Greeks are very independent um even like you know the early Greek city states have sparked a Athens and the current or they were very independent um almost separate nations have resort but they all polluted and all kind of use best practices\nOr to better themselves and I think the Greeks you know the Greeks have said we can't turn anywhere else I mean we're kind of we we've got to help herself they've been very self reliant is is one quality that I've seen with Greeks\nAnd um you know we're we're a definitely a minority I I think that a Greek Americans make up um something less than half a percent of the U.S population but I'm per capita there are more Greek PHD's than any other class\nAnd if millionaires is while they're more Greek millionaires\nThan any other ethnic group and this is again per capita two hundred small small base of people yeah\nYeah and I'm Lebanese and and we're a little behind the Greeks but here's a group of people that come into this country and I got to tell you do not many I got made fun of a lot it didn't bother me because my parents said don't worry about it\nYou know for every person to make money and there's ten people love you and I found the truth is due to the nature of the American experiments and the American people there really generous they wanted to try out my foods the family foods and they were deeply curious and that\nOne no go ahead and the crowd you just had to learn to ignore them and get on with the rest of your life [laughter] and then\nI got a Lebanese friends talking rather that wasn't that funny people really great\nPeople you know he's just saying let's turn something really ugly and something funny yeah life's short\nSo let's talk back to that fifty marathons and sixty days and they just said you you start in St Louis and September Seventy two thousand six\nWith Lewis and Clark marathon you ended in November of two thousand six with the New York city marathon and talk about some highlights some low light to dean 'cause you got to be moments even inside you are you going what was I thinking\n[laughter] plenty of those moments of but you know it was great exploration I mean it was a ... for one you know just for the listeners to explain how I did this I had a big school bus\nAnd my mom is a retired public school teacher so I brought my kids along to my daughter my son they were young at that point and my mom would wrote school them so she basically home school them as we're driving around the country for fifty days at their schools were sending them the lesson plans emailing them to my mom\nEvery Sunday night and she teach a lesson throughout the week and we all of a sudden became like that I kind of this traveling um road show where\nAll of my kids' friends from school or so curious you know what were the experiences they were having a and then their parents learned about it so now their parents were far as and people started learning about what I was doing and they were coming out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race in Iowa on Tuesday Morning\nFor an end yeah though and marathon for flying from Alaska guy came in from Japan to run with me they heard about this and it just sort of like this Brotherhood they can't sister that they came together after that was you know the ... the really a\nPoignant and and beautiful lights yeah some of the low moments where I remember running a marathon in Alaska and it was snowing and cold and the next day I was in Arizona and it was about a hundred and five degrees running through the desert and I remember finishing the re thinking\nThis is marathon Nineteen I can barely walk you know how am I going to get out of bed to all morning and run a marathon let alone you know thirty more after that so there were some moments where I really doubt it I could do it um and just you know\nKept that American Spirit to said you know when I get out of bed in the morning I Would say I don't think about running a marathon just get to the sink you know the bathroom it's lots of water in your face\nYou know okay that's great to just put on your shorts you know one leg at a time okay lace up your shoes okay get out the door [laughter] get to the starting line okay just start running just put one foot in front of the other uh so it became at point the very cerebral challenge as well as the physical one\nYeah I Would assume that you know I've gotten into my ... life and he has the same for all the young guys on the court and it's not anything else but these two simple words next to play\nNot to play before and not to replace five please the next game or the NCAA finals just next play and so many of the kids in an athlete who played under his to ...\nTalk about how that helps them focus on just the next activity in front of you life didn't become as intimidating that way\nWell and if ... you're right I'm with running you know it gets very grand a right to say yeah instead of next play its next step your next step\nNext step because you tend to look at the market especially during the marathon you know you might be at mile you might see a market says my Eighteen\nWhich means you know you basically have over eight miles to go and you know you might be cramping at that point you know you might just be completely exhausted it's demoralizing at the heavy weight and your shoulders to think how am I going to run another eight miles on top of what I done\nDon't do that I just said next step foot the blinders on about the future don't reflect on the path to be in the present moment in the now next step next step so I really I can relate to the next play mentality\nYeah and it's a great thing for life I think kind of stay in the moment and not get overwhelmed by the youngsters in season life which can easily overwhelm any of us if we look too far down the road or too far back into the past it can be paralyzing\nLet's talk about this cross country road trip because my goodness we talked to one person who's biked across the country for Dave Dave Thomas's foundation he's a Wendy's franchisees who said my goodness I Want to raise the money for kids\nAnd so he wrote that he wrote across the country on a bicycle and we followed him along what was jogging you cross the country like and finally what did you learn about your country when you do this and that fifty day into the state or adventure and what's your family learn\nWell you know I'd I learned we're we're a very diverse country I mean you you hear this set all the time and it's almost cliche but the regional differences I'm not just with the food and you know the dialect\nBut with philosophy and the way you approach life is so varied as you run across the country\nUm but the one the one you know the the one uniting thing if it were all free and we're all freedom loving people\nSo that support I got along the way was remarkable it's almost like Forrest Gump I mean some days I'd be running and there'd be forty or fifty people running with me on the remote highway [laughter] out in the desert I remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm\nI remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm and people showing up on the side of the road with hot chocolate\nSo we you know I I learned that running can transcend our differences and bring people together I mean there's so many things in this world that that divide us right be it you know political beliefs to Carver scan the God we worship whatever\nI Wonder how is that they're running a and people were running with me it's a commonality all of the human share and it brought us together regardless of you know the food we ate um you know the accident we add so I it was really beautiful you're seeing that the support of people that came out I'm not talking about elite runners some elite runners but\nSome people just coming out to run a mile or two by my side\nYep and by the way what's so interesting to me I had a dear friend of mine just telling you guy who was one of my mentors and he said you know if you can do these three things a lot you can have a happy life play sports a lot 'cause you're not talking dance a lot 'cause you're not talking\nAnd and last but not least and this was just you love a lot 'cause then you're not talking [laughter] and I love and you're not talking about going out or yeah I think I'll go with a letter to when we come back and I think that's what's transcendental is you're running where people\nYou're not going to get them into an argument you running together you might chat a little bit but there's something about just running together just throwing the ball with your kids you don't have to talk throws the ball it just the movements\nOf the the movement back just a beautiful thing as a sense when we come back more with ultra marathon man dean ... this is our American stories and by the way to hear all we do go to our American network dot org such Elena ... Donne or more after these\nMaps [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou hear a lot of value of their college here on our American story it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in

stories and I can tell you there's no better place to teach\nYeah he said that man makes it don't eat it and if it tastes good spit it out\n[laughter] and not not ban and bye And let's talk about the road the Florida oh because this I I assume is your most personal book dean or why did you write it and talk about the book if you\nGet with the murders part is you're right it's it's a very personal journey and it's about the original marathon and the ... the Greek runner CD pd surfer devotees that ran the marathon and uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so\nYou know ironically right now the book is it's number one on Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I doubt very deeply into the history of of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and\nI also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from so I actually went back degrees to the very village my grandfather came from and his grandfather and his grandfather before him and discovered a lot about\nYou know what I'm all about and how I became who I Am and where my people came from and that to me it was fascinating I think that's something that that you know we look at the the popularity of things like ancestry dot com\nOr twenty three and me are the genetic tests that can tell you where your ancestors came from not only did I learn where my ancestors came from I visited these places and ... how they live you know generations ago and that was really fascinated I write about all of us in the book\nYou know there's one point in time where you say at the START I was surrounded by three hundred and fifty warriors huddled in the pre dawn missed at the foot in the crumbling of Athens for me the quest was deeply personal I've been waiting a lifetime to be standing in this place\nI Would finally run alongside my ancient brother close out with us those words who was an ancient brother you just mentioned them and that feeling running and starting to run by the ...\nIf they didn't you brother was his name was the deputy and he was part of a class of people called humor of drove me they were professional day long runners they were foot Harold foot messengers and his mission was ... when the Persian invaded Greece at the ... marathon\nThe Athenians said we need to recruit the Spartans to help us we need reinforcements were badly outnumbered they dispatch says this man but if it is to run a hundred and fifty three miles nonstop to spark a to recruit the Spartans\nTo battle and it was because of his ... undertaking in his mission that democracy is what it is today I mean he basically saved democracy Greece was the first democratic state and the Persians wander crush him\nHad he not succeeded in running a hundred and fifty three miles to recruit the Spartans or life to be very much different and to me that it's it was incredible to retrace his footsteps and to do it um myself twenty five hundred years later\nAnd that's what we love doing here in our American stories digging into the story of the people we have on and my goodness that sounds like the whole story without the horse and my goodness what a big win dean pronounce his\nVotes marathon man thanks so much for joining us\nThanks for having me on this is will you be then
