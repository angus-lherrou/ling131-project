bass presser did respond\nAnd they responded with adjustment to the elite series court corny Nineteen that are absolutely stunning\nWhere you know guys that are committed now and have committed elite series for twenty Nineteen that worldly healers and twenty Eighteen official for gas money John I mean it's amazing you know the the money that all of them\nFor basically no entry fee\nAnd they want to talk more about that I understand that pretty much everybody in the elite series now is going to get a paycheck is that correct\nYeah um they won't pay one through eighty that model was based on a spot by the way let me just say that the plot I doubt very seriously there'll be eighty\nAnd the elite that series this year I think they'll be somewhere between sixty five and Seventy and the reason is that the guys that are ... you know there have contracts that are three or two or three year contract you know with the with the lead series\nYou you need to leave a little bit of room\nSo that next year ...\nPro shop spacecraft are open series we'll still have a space to qualify guys into the elites are twenty twenty so you're still the field with eighty\nYou know and everybody was locked in for a minimum of two years here is open series guys would be out there fishing for no opportunity to get to the elites I Believe that a little bit of a room there but\nBut basically what aspect of it as they put in two million dollars or crushed money\nThey're going to pay every single spot a diet right down to Alaska Christ basically out of the list which means you're going to be a minimum\nOf twenty three thousand five hundred dollars and you're in the house for these guys and then on top of that the twenty thousand dollar or early ... first that elite that that committed to stay\nThat got it down to a negative five hundred dollars and then when you look at the money that was that in five asked master right now for the twenty Nineteen year or the average payout per a lead angler Ninety seven thousand five hundred dollars against zero\nIn you know first money left out of pocket layout as opposed to last year when it was Seventy five thousand dollars and forty five thousand dollar\nSo I mean ... Scott fifty thousand dollar raise its really stunning ... maybe should have been done earlier but you know this is the impact this is why it's really good for all professional fishermen whatever\nWhile I you know as you're running through these numbers the only thing I can think of is a I Wish I was a better fishermen because be I think I heard the wrong profession Tom [laughter]\nYeah I mean these guys are sticks I fish the uh the ...\nOutside Easter is enough\nAt this year with my first year out there with the guys man are they good I may not fish but some young pros and that's the key here\nJohn is that there are so many guys that can catch them we just don't know Sam George and Curt Mitchell in these other guys as well as the guys that have been out there for years and and had made their name so you know my primary job to put it\nPut it really simply herbs are alive last month he he said look it's Tom Brady\nAnd Aaron Rodgers left the NFL are they still have a Super Bowl\nAnd that's exactly what's going on here is that coming up this year a vast vast or the fiftieth class to come up to twenty twenty there's going to be a classic and there's going to be a whole wave of new guys that are going to ah make a big name for themselves through all of this exposure\nThat pass pass or will provide uh I I learned this week this was a stunning number I learned this week that there's three hundred and fifty thousand new a unique views of vast vast alive during a fast I ...\nI I didn't realize that we're that manage he either and fifty

they just walk out on the stage in they've never done this before it takes years to get there\nAnd best master basically has been used to do this you mentioned one of them is the open but bass nation I've always thought of this was kind of like the blue collar anyone can participate level of tournaments fishing and that can leave her things to candidate\nNo absolutely with the with the ... coming up in a\nNovember on pay quick though though qualified guys that go through to ... and then also guys that do qualify gotta go to the vast vast a classic and yeah there's a structure in place you know that's the one thing about the elites or ... you don't get on the elite\nTour because your buddies or somebody or you know somebody or you gotta get sponsorship deal or or whatever I mean you know ... ... ... you have to earn your way out to that deal and so whether it's coming out of college series\nLike ... and so many others have or whether it caught me and you know through a up through the ranks of the ...\nAnd then he opens and qualify for the elite series that way you know it's it's not it's not an invitation all the ... ... and uh so you've got to earn your way onto this thing and and that's why I say these guy amazing\nAspect of a hundred and fifty guys they're qualified fishermen elites tomorrow or there there is that what you're interested in wanting to be at it but you know
