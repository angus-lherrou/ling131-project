defined by their ethnicity or sexual practices their gender\nOr their race and the justice that Americans have been devoted to historically is quite different it is the justice American school kids pledge allegiance to in saying the United states is one nation\nWe need to be better than this we can be better than it is for\nThe he's right the the people who hate on the president or not the solution\nThe the voices that go crazy Eddie glide who I like a lot with on MSNBC yesterday when I see how the I'll tell them this is not this is not how you talk about the president said he'd go out on MSNBC with Stephanie rule yesterday can watch 'em over on the live stream it gives you a dot com crash number two\nI it it works politically but I Do because it means something citizenship in this country has always been tied to free white person system naturalization act of Seventeen Ninety so he and vote this question of immigration and you're saying play with the Republican base is all about a certain conception of what this\nThis idea of why is it has led to eleven people being ... in in in Pittsburgh people in the program go people are less so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing to those basic things I don't want to play the political game with regards to that\nI Know what the fourteenth amendment was all about is that they think sixty eight is part of the reconstruction of everything to do with the management of slavery and everything to do with making us being able to have citizenship as everything to do what part of the second thing of the country\nDon't read the second inaugural don't look at what Lincoln said don't play politically innocent shows that the country is pro [noise] only race\nNow you see what's what's interesting about that is because Eddie gets work that\nYou would tend to think he's got the moral argument he doesn't he just made it profoundly immoral argument calling the president moral monster the debate over birthright citizenship and by the way I agree on the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment that Eddie puts forward but it is an open question\nAn here is Harry Reid of all people on the

monster it's not a moral monitored to argue about whether or not the constitution was intended to confer citizenship on children whose parents are in the country illegally when they're born\nMeanwhile Jonathan Turley a man of the left professor at George Washington University School of law went on Fox News with mark McCowan last night to make the same argument watch it on the screen or listen to it cut number eight\nAbout a hundred and fifty years late in finding out what this amendment means there has been a debate since this was first ratified all of this debate turns on these six rather ill chosen words as to what it was men by being subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nSome of the draft or that the time clearly evidence to believe that non citizens that come to this country whether they're diplomats are undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children and so a\nImmediate citizenship for their children\nAnd so there is a good debate here there are three different types of interpretation that have been put forward\nI Can't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United states for any reason um can have a son or when they give birth on our soil\nI that's not evident from the text of the amendment many people at the time clearly didn't hold that few now it's not a ... that's not a frivolous view there's in good faith arguments on both sides but the Supreme Court has never said with any clarity or finality what it means interests\nThat you see that is Jonathan Turley being calm steady
