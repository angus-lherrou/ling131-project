story is one to three am on ten thirty ... voice\n[noise]\n\nThis is what you have to be and this is our American story and we chat with the authors of all sorts and well all kinds of books year to today we're joined by Sam Walker the founding editor of the wall Street Journal sports section and the author of the captain class\nThe hidden forced to create the world's greatest teams\nAnd Sam look there's no better way to start a bar fight than to pick the greatest teams in the world I mean that's really hard and also you get up a bar fight deciding what's a sport what to talk about both of those things and was it hard or was it easy ... somethings telling me it's pretty hard\nI thought it would be you know I had those arguments or the you know they always ended in someone's storm yeah it was impossible to answer and when I realized was that there's really no set criteria for how we define great and no one had really done a rigorous\nIf for how we define great and no one had really done a rigorous study or tried to actually nail down so that was one of the top of the things I\nHad to do at the beginning was defined great and in the end when I decided was that we have to be a little more specific about what team is a team has to have a certain number of people that can't be too people that's more of a partnership I\nFinally decided that five five people was really the point at which group contributions and group chemistry was more important than individual performance so basketball's rather small sport that I studied\nAnd another set of questions which was how do you define great and you know for me one of the problems is when people talk about great teams there's no real set period of time that we applied to it a lot of people talk about teams that were great one sees had incredible undefeated season\nBut what I really want to study what I realized was important is teams that had sustained air dominance for a long time because\nI think any team can get lucky that can win a championship and uh one season or two seasons but really to rule out walked completely and to talk about culture and chemistry then you really had to set the bar for years\nAnd let's talk about some competing theories that are out there because the name of your book is the captain class some people think it's the coaches some people think it's the management some people think it's that super star player or the team of players what led you to this categorization and your choice to study the captain's\nI was completely shocked I I had all of the same assumptions that I think everyone does when I finally done it by the team's ... years and years of work I wondered twenty five thousand teams will hire his ... sports ... over the world and I got down to Seventeen about\nAnd you know the first thing I looked at was tell right I thought town would be the thing yeah but I quickly realized that some of these teams are talented but some of them had talented was clearly rich or even mediocre in some cases so wasn't that the second thing I thought it was ... you know got to be coaching but to my great surprise there\nSelflessness and self sacrifice aren't generally words people use for most CEO's in America we can we can say that safely Sam talking about the Coleman way but he's one of the things about bill Russell and we're going to learn more about some of these other captain is this word cold desire\nAnd my goodness anybody who played around bill Russell understood what that word meant\n[noise] so this is one of my favorite stories because I think it it shows one of the characteristics that we all kind of know is important that that we don't really understand why it's important and not as Roland closeness and\nBill Russell was relentless and I mean to extreme he would get sick before every\nGame they play in meaningless she would throw up in the locker many in fact that he didn't draw because he made a rush to go throw up for what's wrong with you a because he cares so much but the code play was a perfect example of why this matters now\nThis happened in the in his rookie season and they made the NBA Finals in a game seven against the St Louis hawks and\nThere's this one of the first game sevens and it was just a huge event or the credible pressure and Russell is a rookie now lately game a boss and a one point Lee is on a minute left and ... down and Russell charge down the court and he tried to dump all this stuff is tiny ...\nAnd St Louis got three and a St Louis affording jak Coleman had been sort of hanging back behind the play and they quickly inbound all coming at mid core\nAnd he's at many court with the ball in a running start now Russell who had missed that Doug where we see he was underneath his own basket off the court\nOn the other side he was like Ninety six feet from the basket and Coleman is probably about forty five feet with a rising star\nBut when ... came to the room and to make a lay up now this is late in the game they would have taken the lead it might have in the end this blur appeared behind him swat at the ball and it was Russell and he had somehow covered twice the distance take home an ad in the same amount of time\nI mean no body on in that arena or what is already had a chance and he certainly must not have even known himself but just that raw desire that he demonstrated over and over again and competition the thing about it and that was consistent for him and what we don't understand is that studies have shown that\nRuling Russia is highly contagious you know if a group of people do something together thinks that one person in that group is giving a hundred percent off in a real maximum effort that all of them will raise their own performance\nIf you have someone in your mid like that who was relentless and committed to playing at all times at a hundred percent they're going to be serious marginal gains that you will you'll see in your team work and\nThat's just not something we can quantify so it's not something that we teach but I think about comics aren't\nWe've all been around people who have that kind of drive and focus on what it does do our deem we raise our game we raised the bar and when those people aren't present we don't even know where the bar is\nRight exactly yeah I Know it's funny because there are some emotions that are contagious inside a group and\nRelentlessly contagious always in a good way tough this is always contagious and you could wave you showed toughness and persevere and others will too and another one is emotional control or something all these leaders had they had the ability to overcome really difficult personal circumstances and\nNot just compete will compete at a higher level than ever and Tom Brady the patriots is a great example this you know a couple of seasons ago after this whole deflate gate situation you served as suspension but he came back and\nPlayed one of his greatest seasons but even after they won the Superbowl should credible comeback against Lana falcon we find out that his mother having undergoing chemotherapy you know and had been diagnosed with cancer that season so he was going through that he never said a word about no one knew about it\nBecause you had to control to put that away and to play as hard as each um each plane deal with separately and\nNo doubt we're going to get your breathing a little bit because it's such a fascinating chapter in your book let's talk about one more basketball player because I don't think he gets the credit he deserves Tim Duncan of San Antonio spurs talk about Tim Duncan who is the\n[noise] she is a very unusual guy he was a great swimmer I really had incredible talent could have maybe even been an Olympic swimmer but\nYou know the hurricane came in and destroy the local pool and I bought the same time his mother passed away and you know he had these hard knocks and then we started picking up basketball and was very lightly recruited in fact wait for us was right on the school that really took him seriously a very skinny kid and just hadn't gone into his body\nBut you know when he got there and ruined the shirt and became a really hot and the prospect but yeah I don't think anyone really thought that that he was going to become the star that he was or that he would develop skills or he did but\nThe thing that's fascinating my tendon there's two things I think there's so much about him that is instructive for leaders but I think the the most important thing really is the way he played and I he had the talent to dominate the NBA in terms of score you know on any of the famous call your statistics but\nIf you look at his total it's really amazing sweet some years he was very prolific score some years it was not in blocks and rebounds and other things we're we're off the charts she would change his position on the court and play different positions depending on the makeup of the teen\nIt just show the same quality that Russell which is an e you care what numbers were what you thought of him or whether he got on the cover a magazine he only cared about the team winning and he would do whatever grunt work needed to be done and he would change his role to fit\nBut the thing about Tim Duncan that really every once in a study is the way to Munich X.\nI was completely surprised when I looked at these cats because the first thing I thought the first way that you know what I mean it team is is with speech given a big speech right you motivate them with work and none of these ... I mean they did not like to do with some purposely avoided\nAnd I did not understand that I didn't understand how they communicate effectively the team at that I went right to Duncan because if you've ever watched him to give an interview\nYou know she is not\nA charismatic guy he sounds like he's getting a cold and asking the ways answering questions you just have no emotion he's ... he doesn't come across as a charismatic person so how does she ... well she talks a lot but it's a different sort of communication he's always working the room\nTalking individually to one person one on one incredible intense the stairs uses his eye contact and gestures and touch to communicate very intense with people and he listens as much as he talks who actually listens and\nHe had his interactions all the time and he has them in the moment especially when someone has done something wrong or needs courage meant that twenty strings into action and\nWhen I realized the spurs talk more than ...\nStrings attached and when I realized that the spurs talk more than any team I've ever seen and they're always talk on the floor on the bench conflicts in the Haitian and this creates an atmosphere where everyone\nFeels like they can contribute to feel heard and they also feel like they have to account for themselves and all the problems that team had were dressed in them all nothing ever faster as talkative style that they allow them to address problems in the moments in the past and\nThat's why they were so good for so long as finding the playoffs in Nineteen consecutive seasons with a credible revolving cast of players\nAnd won five teddy had the greatest launcher ... percentage and NBA history it was because that that whole climate Duncan created you know allow them to slide new people and got them talking and solving problems so even though it didn't always have the best talent or certainly not the most money they were the most dominant\nTeam of of their hair and NBA\nAnd we're talking with Sam Walker author of the captain class on a terrific series the stats for Tim Duncan wherever you might put them in the pantheon great Nineteen consecutive playoff five

life\nIt meant something everyone understood who she was and what she was all about and it had great power when she did it in competition made the team better\nLet's talk about football now and and two teams in particular first the Nineteen seventies Pittsburgh Steeler teams who is jak Lambert and why did you include them in this book most folks think of Terry Bradshaw when they think about powerhouse Steeler team why was jak whenever the guy you focused on\nThe really the heart and soul that seems defense I mean it was an extraordinary historically great teeth and that was really the the unit that drove that seem forward and just look at the moment to jak Lambert showed up I mean this uses never won a Super Bowl before he got there and uh\nYou know never and now they're you know they want or I think than any other as a team and you know they are they are really a creation of Lambert tenacious style and his aggressive play and his relentless\nJak glamour was a player who had an understanding of something that all these easily captains new to some extent but I think he was part of the best example of it\nThey understood the power of non verbal communication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed to do something\nIn full view their teammates that would show their level of commitment a passion that were transferred to them and allow them to play harder and\nJak labor was famous of course for a new you lost a couple of teeth in high school playing pick up basketball and he\nHad it for that ... that he wore in public but he would take it off on the field so they end up toothless you know mouth and he and would scare people so that was part of it but my favorite jak laboratory that I think shows you a genius of his leadership was that\nThey were playing a game of leave Nineteen Seventy six and they had won the super bowl but they started one in four people were written them off like it's over for the Steelers and they had to win this and they had to beat the Bengals and\nYou want to play uh probably the fights game of his career in terms of number of tackled the recovered fumbled basically accounted for most of the teams points singlehandedly so it wasn't a credible game but not in the middle of this game\nHe had a came to the game you had to cut on his hand and he managed is up and you know he went out there and of course the band just failed in the blood starts hurting out it was all over uniformity pants I mean he was a mess\nI tracked down one of the trainers and ask them why didn't you know you just reroute the ban is when it came off the field or changes uniform and half time or something and you said you don't understand is\nA jak Lambert love having blogs you know for me you understood how powerful message was and how how much heart nations summit play and how much it to me this opponents and uh he did that on purpose and jak labor do all kinds of things that might seem crazier on hands\nBut when you listen to talk about it I mean he always says these were calculated acts these were things that I did a you know on purpose because I understood the power they have in our study the effect it has on the team and\nYou know that's one of the reasons that that team was\nGood so consistently agree on one for Super Bowls and six years or so teams and rhythm\nAnd what

China or last week um but I'm the president a week earlier also raised the issue of China's behavior at the United nations look to your ear a great student a foreign affairs and your listeners know and appreciate your perspective on this I\nUh for my part I'm you know I I watched over the years as the United states\nOf established diplomatic relations with China we opened our economy to China

changes that would protect 'em\nOr the interest of American free enterprise all of that is fueling a massive military buildup by China and as I said last week\nUm the days of standing by a wall China continues to expand a militarily a wallet continues to disregard\nI'm the kind of the rules of the international market place I'm In in trade and otherwise and while it continues to move further and
