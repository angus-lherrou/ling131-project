we've\nThat great great book about Mark Twain's last an epic tour in his life to well get some money back because he'd been broke from so many adventures and misadventures in the stock market and in business\nAnd a book review caught our attention in the wall Street Journal and the title was the Franklin house divided and here's how it started\nOn the fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six Benjamin Franklin was in Philadelphia having helped to\nIn Seventy six Benjamin Franklin was in Philadelphia having helped draft the declaration of independence while his son\nThe governor of New Jersey was under arrest in Connecticut having been branded an enemy of the country for persisting in his royal duties and opposing the revolution in less than a year William Franklin will be taken to the notorious\nWitch feel guile a destination for among others traders who abuse their privileges and lighter incarceration\nAnd that led us to the gas the joins us now the book review was for the loyal son the war in Ben Franklin house and Daniel mark Epstein joins us now thanks for joining us then\nIt's a pleasure to be with you and Daniel tell us what drew you this book\nWell I was always interested in Benjamin Franklin from the time I was a kid you know it was the one of the most first of all Americans man who was great and better\nAnd probably the first great scientist in terms of electricity and of course everybody knows the story about been flying the kite\nAnd I remember seeing the woods of Benjamin Franklin followed flying type with his little boy\nAnd I wonder what would it be like to have Benjamin Franklin as a father I mean a man who was not only a great inventor but created the militia Pennsylvania and order to defend the frontier against the Indians and then you know created the first postal system in Pennsylvania and\nThe University of Pennsylvania and then of course became um one of the greatest American patriots during the revolution but what if you like to be that man's son oh and then of course I found out that Benjamin Franklin's only son was illegitimate bastard\nBut that he was raised just as if they're legitimate sun and the two of them were partners in politics and in military affairs later in diplomacy [noise]\nUm so it was an extraordinary father son relationship and the fact that they went different ways during the revolution\nAnd I'm at that point he retired from the army and his father got him a really good tutor and he started studying law\nAnd then he worked for his father I'm In the legislature in the assembly of Pennsylvania so he got his political career\nAnd then when his father got the job to go off to England as the agent for the assembly Pennsylvania\nRepresenting the the assembly against the proprietors who refused to be taxed his son went with him\nAnd in England is sun rose very quickly if he went to the bar and got his law his law degree in his mid twenties and shortly after that was appointed to be the governor of New Jersey so at that point in his life he was in his late twenties\nOr his father was a fifty in his mid fifties he was even more powerful in the in the government than his father was so he had an extraordinary\nAnd so let's get down to this conflict I mean by the time we get to this damn back as we indicated before\nThe country was in pretty much open rebellion in the civil war was brewing and William took the stand and bend to stand and talk about their final meeting in particular was remarkable before we get to that build up to that if we can set up that I I think almost\nJust tragic scene between the father and son\nWell it's really extraordinary the extent to which the two men were living in different world speak because I'm by Seventeen Seventy five two years before the actual a declaration of independence\nOh we had been living in America he was the governor of New Jersey and he's been the governor of New Jersey for more than a decade\nOr in trying to represent the king's interests in America and try and prevent this revolution which he knew would be a disaster and a lot of people even Benjamin Franklin up until suddenly and Seventy five\nFelt that would be a big mistake\nFor America to separate the mother country meanwhile his father is in England and his father is still working on behalf of the columnist representing the columnist interest in uh in England or against parliament and he's seeing more and more corruption\nIn ah in England and in the meantime the the\nThe English government is sending troops to\nBoston and the rest of America in order to enforce these uh taxation laws and he's growing more and more bitter against the uh the English government so that the two of them were living in different worlds\nAnd when they finally came down to the ah Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd the declaration of independence a Williams thoroughly on the side of the king and the crown and his father at that point was confirmed American patriot revolutionary so they just want different ways even before that I think there was a certain amount of jealousy between fathers\nAnd sons as sometimes happens tragically hum and his death I think it was a little bit jealous of William\nSo let's talk next about this father and son there at loggerheads what happens to William next as he takes the in the country is moving more clearly ready for war Williams not\nWell first of all his father came home in time to try to talk his son over to the the side that ... would be the safest that is the side of the revolutionaries\nAnd the two had some very very strongly confrontations I'm In Pennsylvania and New Jersey oh where where his father visited him and he did everything he could to try to get him to come over to the side of the revolutionaries\nBecause that was his side of the family side and William refused\nAnd William uh ended up being the last um the last royal governor to do the kings business in America [noise]\nA stubbornly refused to leave the governor's mansion and had to be taken away bottle am was put into the worst prison in America the ... field jail\nWhere he was in solitary confinement with bread and water for Eighteen months in suffered terribly during that time um he finally was released in the prisoners exchange but his father had very little to do with that and eventually went back to England\nAnd this had to really hurt Ben Franklin I mean hey it's his son and no matter what kind of job you might have existed\nAnd watch this before this kind of like for your son had to be difficult more over he's a very public figure and it wasn't as if his son was some wallflower he was a governor who is now in jail how did you handle that\nWell Franklin said nothing I'd ever heard him so bad and his entire life and you have to believe that [noise]\nThere was a lot of public criticism of him for not for not helping his son out but remember he was the minister plenty of potential jury to France\nAnd could not be seen as being in collusion with you know with Atari and so he was a horrible ... it's really a tragic situation which really is kind of like the um [noise] ah the revolutionary war in microcosm\nAnd do you think he really understood the sons or should\nI don't know I don't really think I think the the part of the tragedy of the book and what I finally end up saying in the end is that\nThese were two men who could never reconcile although the son wanted to weigh more than two more than his father that they could never reconcile because they they just did not understand each other and these are two very intelligent man\nSo it shows you just how extreme of this break between father and son can be bought it happens\nIn in in the end the father didn't understand the sun but the son didn't understand that either\nI don't think so I don't part of the what a what we haven't spoken about is that at the end of the war we became a counter revolutionary a violent counter revolutionary and this his father could not could not ever forgive\nAnd indeed he couldn't in by the way father son stories\nWill rebutting always drawing everyone in I mean this is the author Miller who's living selling father son during the second Bruce Springsteen's me\nAnd it's good harrowing story I remember in ... new markets dean boil some more in Franklin's house thanks

British Crown and in large measure today a lot of the populist movement\nMany people believe it's because it's a foreign power called Washington DC and many people in this country feel like\nThat

number to\nRhetoric senator identified the news media looting CNN all the enemy of the American people for example they live I've asked do these violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I've been concerned about that for a long time I spoke about it like in the Senate started in January about the president's rhetoric\nRemember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he his kind of guy\nTo hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton and tried to briefly speak towards unity towards Brock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they are making people laugh face they are making Syria last last day and they're making law enforcement officer is less safe\nBut we don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but there's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros\nThese are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack will demonize is caused by if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz not but\nCertainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been getting out of these last several weeks leading into the mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of that say\nMid term election and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of that\nSay I mean there are all people that Donald Trump eight they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against or whether it's journalists like CNN where the John Brennan letter wasn't dressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I think with high and former colleagues to CNN and they're scared and one highly former colleagues fat this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people that try and I thought my gosh you know it's it's the tone and coming from the top\nAnd now than it has become a target journalists that are simply trying to get three\nHours ago the president was either a very later got up very early tweeted this\n[laughter] [noise]\nSunny out lowly right at CNN and others can criticize me will even blaming me for the current state of bombs in ridiculously comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing writes the president yeah when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential\nOverlook a lot of people are blaming trumping that's silly we don't know who to blame you\nKnow we we can by members of the bombs and we find that out in the FBI with ten or eleven packages is going to have it or if it wasn't so serious it would be like a holiday corner cover the FBI lab as they got more leads than than I Do points on my airline mileage um\nSo there'll be finding and it's either going to be you know a professional alligator grab we're in Florida living in the Everglades\nOr the same Russian GRE ... types who use the nerve agent in in London on ... and then said they were tourists Chuck Todd by the way agrees with me about this ... number one\nChecked I have this fear that it could be some variation too and designed to do\nWhat's happening out more of this you know I think it ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow 'em\nYeah don't rule out the Russians also rule out Bob Hugin to New Jersey don't rely Patt Morrison West Virginia don't rule out ... ... in Wisconsin when I went my run down that got us to Republican night a plus five wins I'm not really expecting that\nBut I mean if the way it could I think there's a lot to discuss growing with the media right now over the non coverage of the care of it\nSo I think there's a lot of\nMisunderstanding about where we are in terms of the\nThe electric way there is no blue wave there might be a red white and if people are mad at the media I think there are rallying behind the president there running around some great candidates and this could be a real surprise on election night a real

Scalia's a decision I'm Still persuaded bicycle you that he's right have you gotten into it with say Randy Barnett at Georgetown yet talked about originalism and how it plays out and I'm an American dialogue\nI've talked to him yeah in fact I wanted me to come to his class there and see what yeah yeah uh yeah and I talked to a Ginsberg who's the originals the sort of moderate or there's a\nThere's a spectrum of a ... opinion within the originalist a physician and most and that is correct the federal is most people in the federalist society or originalists them the extreme originalist till the ones that tend to get nominated for\nThe Supreme Court and um I think Kavanaugh and ... were such such creatures of I guess what I'm saying is that\n[noise] and this will\nYou on the president made plenty southern ... such creature I think they're wonderful man and extraordinary tourists and I bet you do that too but when you say in this political environment I liked the humanize rather than dehumanizing you agree with me on that I\nDon't mean to I mean didn't I don't mean to dehumanize them at all\nAs a creature that they're they're just very very firm original is they are um\n... committed texture was to the document as it was understood at the time of the frame\nRight but the world will disagree is that I think that\nThe Heller decision which I pick because the decision is two thousand eight is the one on the second amendment as you well know and um that\nThe school is called that his masterpiece yes that\nTherefore it's the the clearest articulation of originalism in the Supreme Court decision last year far\nYeah and and so when I look at it\nAnd look at the actual behavior and thinking of Madison and the spring of Seventeen eighty nine when he's writing the second amendment and the debate is both the house and then in the Senate and then the debate in the eleventh states ratified\nWhat's going on there has nothing to do with owning a gun it has to do with whether or not\nA defense of the republic will be in the hands of state militias or a federal army and the great fear of a federal army as big as a standing army not just the fear of what the British Army represented those that's primary even of the continental army\nYou're absolutely right that is that Justice Stevens descent and I think American dialogue exception expands on her way that he did not know that might persuade young people are undecided on the other hand I I Am persuaded by the general understanding in the states at that time concerning firearms in frontier defense that even beyond the militia people of course\nHad the right to carry weapons in the steward discussion instead of what I wanted to get to what I really liked about American dialogue and I want everyone on my team the Reagan was seemed to going to get as you explain how James Madison came to bed early at first and then\nI'm a resigned himself to and then maybe even a applied equal representation in the Senate as the necessary means of getting to where he wanted to get which was dual sovereign he didn't want to get the bill sovereignty\nHe wanted more he's more Hamel Tony and then most people now and you lay it out there was no doubt in anyone's mind at the end that the states would forever have equal representation in the upper body correct\nYes though he regretted it I mean but he knew that it was absolutely essential if the ... constitutional first to pass and then be ratified because it was a gesture towards a state sovereignty us\nAnd that the the the makeup of the convention and then the makeup of the ratification conventions was are filled with people who were very dubious about\nAny federal government they created a consolidated power structure that was a the re creation of the British leviathan they thought they were escaping from and so if he hadn't made that compromise\nUm it would've never passed and he was as I was saying earlier committed to a of\nMaking those kind of compromise decisions and he later said you know that was the only thing to do and but when he first left\nThe convention in September of Seventeen eighty seven and he wrote to Jefferson he said we failed\nUm because the Senate issue that you're describing you is you know still gives the states of a stronger\nSubset of authority and power than we thought we we we can\nThat is already in power than we thought we we we can allow and that that will be a problem for us\nSo it requires a unanimous consent of the states to amend that provision and therefore I don't think I'd ever will be I have one suggestion\nWhat your eventually I agree that the the big decision they made was Nineteen Thirteen to make set of the elected not by the state legislatures but but by the people at large and he would have supported that too um but there does come to be a problem in the sense that let's say north and South Dakota have blew up his additives\nWith the total population that's less than half the size of Los Angeles\nBut if you look at Rhode Island versus Virginia the framing that sort of disparity in Vermont even worsening Vermont had the greatest disparity with Virginia at different too\nThat's true although Rhode Island didn't count as it did show up\nBut Vermont did let let me give you a suggested I hold your breath through the break if I Can't professor
