it's not a that's a great honey destination it's the sunflower state the state of Kansas and with us here to tell you more about it is Mike Miller who works for the state and knows\nAll about hunting and fishing there Mike welcome to the show\nGlad to be here John So Mike let's start off with deer because I think most folks do know that Kansas is a great place to look for white tailed deer in November is a really good time to go after\nYeah we're kind of known as one of those a trophy whitetail destination states and and that that is just really you know grown in an interest over the last say seven or eight years we've always had a one book policy for residents and non residents and I think that's allowed I think our biggest secret us we let\nTheir kids to be four and a half and five and a half years old and that's one of the reasons we have you know good trophy a deer\nAre usually starts the ah in October that first week of November and that's when the bow hunters really like to be in the woods here because when the rockets going you know things here crazy\nWhen it comes to non resident opportunities how does that work in terms of getting a tag in terms of getting access is there a lot of public land or is it mostly private land and outs that are you working with\nWell the first question is it is a limited draw for non resident hunters\nThe application period of the month of April and it's an online application that you can make to our website at ... dot com and then there is a drawing held um chess rates are very high we set our quotas to try to meet demand demand has shifted and has increased in some units in recent years and so in the eastern part of the state where\nWe used to have leftover permits we're now seeing some of those units over subscribed but we do have adjustment factors and we do make adjustments from year to year that application period again is in the month of April and you'll need to do that\nTo be ready for the next year season\nRegarding access is there a lot of public lands for hunters to to find their or is it mainly working through private outfitters and getting on the leaf plants\nWell Kansas is a private land states so it's Ninety seven percent privately owned so most of our hunting does occur on private lands we manage how probably close to one point seven\nMillion acres most of that\nOne million acres of that is in our walking hunting access program which is private lands release as an agency and opened up public counting the rest of that is in you know areas around reservoirs and lands that we own and manage for public land so again most of the hunting is done on private land so you need to either have a contract with landowners were worked through and after\nAll right so I was going to ask you about el because of folks believe it or not I didn't know that there is no honey to be had in Kansas but it's very limited it's only open to state residents so let's turn our focus to birds because I'm guessing you can buy an over the counter license and you can do pheasant hunting the Kansas right now\nYou can see that opens a second Saturday November this year so off until November tense power it's all you need is a non resident a hunting license which is Ninety seven dollars and fifty cents the season last in the end of January and our licenses as of this year or three hundred and sixty\nFive day licenses so if you buy a license now it's going to be going through the entire pheasant season we're always in one of the top three states in the nation for pheasant harvest I think last year we were probably number two we're looking at what we consider fairly good pheasant hunting and most of our primary regions this year um we'd come off a series\nOf dry winters and so that isn't the best nesting habitat for pheasant early in the spring but we still are going to be one of the top states for pheasant hunting this year again\nAnd when it comes up land birds I'm guessing it yes doesn't you've probably got a pretty healthy population of ... too don't ya\nYeah we were actually the top state in the Niger prequel harvest last year how we're usually right there with Oklahoma Texas as far as harvest\nAnd we've we've seen in the last three years of modern quail boom especially in North central south central south west parts of our state and the the dry winters haven't hurt the quail because we started getting rains and in fact April and may and the way on that later than pheasants into our Bob White populations have been very very good the last few years\nGetting back to access so you already explained that primarily for talking private lands here the state does have a lot of land center manages walking property is that what this\nHave a lot of lands that are managed as walking property is that what these up Lindbergh hunters are taking advantage of us he's walking properties or they again going with private outfitters\nYou know the the walking properties or wherever hunters really shine because a lot of times it Cherokee or it's native grass or it's the deer hunting leases are really tough for us to compete with because of what people are willing to pay as to how white tailed deer or we can least lands that are very good bird hunting\nAnd solve majority of our a walk in areas and the western part of the state our for our good open birds and so we have an outlet we call it you know our hunting outlets that we make available online and we have printed copies will mail for people that I can pick him up wherever they buy their license\nAnd that shows all of our walking areas as well as our federal and state areas so guy could pick up one of these and and really travel around and look at these areas and find a lot of good bird hunting I'm Serious it's like anything you have to do a little bit of scouting\nCars from one year to the next farming practices change whether you know a circumstances are different and so it does take a little bit groundwork for the hunter but you've got a million and a half acres at your fingertips without Alice\nYou're listening to America outdoors radio we're talking with Mike Miller what the Kansas department of wildlife parks and tourism about the eighty three thousand square miles of hunting opportunities alone with fishing bird watching that weight in the sunflower state\nSo we talked about pheasants we talked about well we talked about here all great opportunities this has got to be a big economic boom to the state of Kansas\nAbsolutely you know ... over well over four hundred million dollars a year and Kansas I'm In the western part of the state if it's a it's really important to a lot of those real communities\nI grew up in one of those communities and that was the only time I ever saw the motels in our town full was that opening weekend and maybe that second weekend to heaven season and so it's a big deal they roll out the red carpet for bird hunters and hunters in general

people to come out to Kansas right now to enjoy some of the little one other opportunity we need to talk about duck hunting I don't think most people think of Kansas is a great duck hunting states but you've got a lot of opportunities for both ducks and geese don't ya\nWe do you know again were highly agricultural and so we have some large marshes reservoirs are through the central part of the state and eastern part of the state and so the waterfowl will come and when we have good water\nConditions like we do this year we had an awful lot of rain the last two months those waterfowl steak chase both will stay in the area for a link or the\nFall because there's so much food available they can research on the reservoirs and marshes and then she'd on a a harvest the crop yields that are just you know a short distance away I'm from anywhere in Kansas basically because we are so agricultural so we can have some very good a duck and good hunting and federal\nLast quarter and to you know
