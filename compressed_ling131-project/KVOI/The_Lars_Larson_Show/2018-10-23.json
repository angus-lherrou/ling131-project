the rule of law series\n\nI tell them more people will do that\nIf a dairy farmer ... lays on the ... question before you're done you're going to commit to 'cause we've got to be something wrong with it\nTo be clear this Marilyn dairy farmer Randy ... hours is including himself in that\nThey're absolutely I mean so we were always somebody to deal with what we deal with every day for no more than we get out of it\nThe deal with what we deal with every day for no more than we get out of it\nWe've all these forms three years ago\nI mean it's just going to be a burden on me and my kids\nThey get these are paid for it in their kids you know decided to stay in farming while these days they might you know get some editor right now the farm to cost us more we can make off of them are farmers drop everything the bank sent in those last week before closing and we've got a neighbor fairly foreclosed on in January\nSo I'm Glad you know make farmers usually am and farmers are born and raised and they know what to do and they have the heart to do it I mean\nMost people know would even consider do we do\nIt seven days a week when you don't get a break\nFor Thirty years I've been doing this I've gotten up as early as eleven Fifteen night the milk or way\nDid he just said get up at night to catch up and eat besides folks of course when night shifts but that's not Randy situation\nWell I Try to get the bed about seven or seven thirty\nPretty hard when it's still light outside but\nEarly years and didn't have any help\nThat was in the middle of the team that I get done about\nSeven or eight in the morning [noise]\nNon sleep till ten o'clock\nThen get up and get back to work but\nTwenty years and then get up at midnight me and my wife and we will first shift the cows and we usually get back home about four o'clock we don't milk 'em all anymore but we do know first shift because what I found out over the years\nI depend on somebody else to get in there early they don't show up and then makes whole day go bad so\nDecided to myself that way you get the day started people to you know come after me they'd better be there I'm going to go get him out of bed because I Know where they are that's we're retired in December we ended up five one's a week but the other day we do farmers market\nPretty nice though through the winter though we don't have the one Sunday market through the winter I guess sleeping on Sunday Morning\nHer avoid the paperwork but this ruling was\nUnacceptable to government prosecutors and they convince Congress to amend the wording of the banks secrecy act so that they could prosecute Americans like Randy who don't know that structuring is only\n[noise]\nSo they had me on structuring because\nNot that I knew there was a law though that I had a positive\nEvery cent I got every week maybe I spent on something else that was still in more than ten thousand dollars but\nIt really didn't matter to them and they were pretty nice I guess in ice and they said you know we can see or a legitimate business we really don't think your lawn money launder drug bill or nothing like that but now says it's gone as far you have to go through the system to see if we can get their money back\nGone as far as their boss and then Marilyn us attorney rod ... Rosen steam was already committed to the case and there is no way that they thought\nThat they can get him to back down on it a judge had already issued a warrant for the seizure of Randy's bank account Randy ... money was this close to being [noise]\nThat I was not a drug dealer law the lawn or they just gave me my money back and say wait for my services this country\nAnd that would have been the end of it but they don't they got your money and they want it and you know over this period of time [noise]\nIt's not the IRS and gets a lot of money it's the local people than you know find this problem they get their cut do everybody gets their cut as how they make their budget\nSo they take all their money away how they're going to pay it or you know all these are things they get because all the structures [noise]\nIn the department of justice in Maryland is particularly active in pursuing this structuring money in the fiscal year two thousand eleven Marilyn brought fourteen of the nation's Ninety nine structuring cases for ... percent of them\nEven though they only make up one point eight percent of the nation's population so supposedly Marilyn citizens or eight times more likely to be committing crimes then the rest of us or\nSomething else is going on raw they're frozen steam is on the record as saying that anti structuring efforts are quote an increasing area the emphasis for the Justice Department and there has been an influx of resources to\nInvestigate it dust\nI'd be disappointed if there was an uptick\nIn prosecution [noise]\nSo my lawyer called is\nWhoever the prosecutor was on the case Rob roses and actually it was the part of a justice in Maryland at the time felt like see him go to jail now go visiting but he called him\nOne of rods deputies\nHe said well that's the way it goes and we will and won't negotiate new or probably keep half that money you might you may have to go she ate that down some but you know use the you know we'll negotiate some kind of a a deal\nTreating it all too casually like it's negotiating some thing at a garage sale not thirty thousand dollars above\nBusinesses families\nSomehow I don't know how\nIt all came down but there was another lawyer showed up\nAnd he'd been you know work on the structure thing for a long time\nBut they all told me\nYou know to keep my mouth shut and not tell anybody about it\nI think all these papers but when I went to a farmer's markets that weekend everybody knew that the government stole my money everybody walked in and say well now I Know I have a we go I told the story [laughter]\nAnd they were they they couldn't believe it\nSo it wasn't too long after that that a\nGuy got a call from Baltimore city paper and he was questioned me about you know this because he saw the docks coming out of federal court in Baltimore\nAnd I said you know I'd love to tell you the story but my lawyer said till we get this thing's\nSettled I better just not say nothing except for the government wanted everybody do say nothing so they can still your money and nobody knows what's going on so he said well you know that's the way you want to look at it but I'm going to do the story do look good on your part of our rights from what the government says\nSo his government's allowed to speak about him but they said that he's not allowed to respond\nBecause people already thought we'd done something wrong with her by her her parents thought we had done something wrong I think my parents my ah though it does I'm wrong then\nSo I thought the whole story\nSo when we got our settlement papers yeah we knew from the\nCase on the eastern shore with a\nWe knew what their settlement was when my son was different I was in the mix I did something wrong in the settlement I wouldn't do it\nSo I'm a lawyer call them\nHe says because your client went to the press\nAnd he says and email it said it\nRosen's teams deputies Stefan ... actually wrote an email but they were treated differently because quote Mr Taylor did not give an interview to the press admitting as clear as day that the government is acting\nAccording to a rule of vengeance\nNot according to the American promise of the rule of law\nSo he said wasn't\nGoing to do is be any negotiating you know they were keeping them as opposed to thirty thousand dollars into other than the shady now since I went to the press\nIf we were fought him if we had a fault him\nThey would have got took the whole three hundred and sixty thousand dollars a week pauses then that checking account that year so that was another thing they were holding the dissident fight is that you know you're not going to win and they were going on three are sixty thousand\nThis is what you call\nBlack male either pay us thirty thousand or going to come after you for more three hundred and sixty thousand and\nBy the way fighting in court will cost you a lot more than thirty thousand so you might as well just pay us right now a pretty good business to be in if you or the government they can do this all day long and do\nBut not a great business proposition if you're Randy\nBut not a great business proposition if you're Randy and caring especially when you're trying to do your actual his sense of farming\nIt's a no win situation for them if they lose\nNo matter what\nSo the ... hours decided to forfeit the thirty thousand dollars of their sees the money to the government\nAnd tried to move on with their lives\nFar with a lot of time to go out and fight it\nYou can't fight him short hand by the government\nPut in the meantime there's for justice had been working on some of these cases\nIn our in contact with them and they came out we had a meeting\nBut my cases already settled they just\nReally wasn't a whole lot they can do [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to hear what happens when liberty lawyers get involved in that sort of the Institute for justice his lawyers are they protect people's property rights from the government and always remember why the constitution was formed\nAs we all know that most of our cops and prosecutors are good guys but the bad ones and boy there was some bad ones here folks\nAnd you know it right you know and when we come back\nThe law on behalf of the citizens starts to take action [noise]\nBrandy salary story here\nOn our American

are guilty send those stories to us we'll run 'em down because this is happening all over the country and it's happening a lot more than you think\nAgain this is our American stories when we return the dairy farmer Randy shower shaken down by his own government the guy just trying to get along every day like the rest of us\n\n\nBack [noise]\n[noise]\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nAnd isn't that why Randy is so grateful that the nonprofit Institute for justice is their fight\nTo\nWin for him and for the over two hundred other citizens who look government had their backs up against the wall and they couldn't afford to fight them until Institute for justice took off their case at\nNo cost to them and with no reward ever going\nTo the nonprofit\nThis will be for justice of the budget young lawyers that are concerned about this country\nI met a good many of them they all have the same outlook or not out there\nTo make a lot of money I have no idea how much money they make I don't care most all the money comes in donations\nFrom people that like what they say and not people like me 'cause I don't have a lot of money and give them I mean people think I have a lot of money I mean so now live in a big house but you know the house came with a land we both are they really want the houses to big\nThat's why I'm living there just two of us because nobody does want to live in it\nBut you know people what people think about farmers is is ridiculous because they think you're rich because you've got big machines tells a lot of money and that's why you're not rich because you've got to have those machines do what you do [noise]\nTen great work there's always Alex\nBy the way a major bank CEO confidentially told us that the government has essentially forced them\nInto being their own private snooping army with their compliance department selling the mind their customers accounts but what the government like deem suspicious activity given them no choice but to report many innocent citizens like Randy showers and the government for investigation\nDoes she said that this force snooping sweeps up formed more information than anything that the NSA did related to phone records and yet has received almost zero attention\nAnd that's what we're doing here in our American stories bringing this story to your attention is also a big problem selective prosecution here\nThe government has seized the bank accounts of innocent farmers like Randy sours but refused to charge politicians like former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who was actually guilty of structuring his payments to prostitutes and you bet he knew what structuring was\nThere's bipartisan legislation out their folks and it's sponsored by Democrats like congressman Sheila Jackson Lee and Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz and that doesn't happen too often so that's how bad this prosecutorial abuse is oaks\nOf course that would change the statute so that you can't be charged for a crime that you don't know is a crime\nIt's called men's rare folks it's the heart of criminal law if you don't know of crimes that crime you can't be charged with it this is Lee Habib\nRandy shower story and thank goodness of the Institute for justice looked him up folks give them some money\nThey do great great work protecting property rights for Randy maybe one day for people like you\nAgain this is our American story [noise]\nHi hello Hi were the producers producers and our

so much for joining us for the Hugh Hewitt show my name is Bob branch us off sick today after his rally in\nA Pittsburgh last night but I was a tough one a railing against the president and now it was a battleground soccer store event in Pittsburgh obviously with you and a lot of colleagues Michael my bed and others I'm sure it was great event but ah\nAh you had that feeling Pittsburgh while battling the uh the illness that took his voice from them yesterday so I'm very happy to be sitting in for today from the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer\nIn Cleveland so the president\nA rally last night as a mentioned uh for Ted Cruz but also rallying for himself and for just the conservative Republican vision in this country and why it is it's so important to so integral for\nThe Republicans to not only a hold on to but maybe expand their majority in the United States Senate but also to try to hold off\nA the Democrats whether it'd be a wave or a trickle just we cannot let them are in it but the president says of course I'll\nTake over the house we cannot deal with speaker\nPelosi we cannot deal with a Democrat that shareholders I'm a chair persons of various committees are which will wipe out important investigations are ongoing right now which will start new investigations that will be politically motivated and more so you know the president is doing everything it can I said before the break\nYou know his energy level is absolutely unmatched\nI said that not to just be you know overly overly complementary of the leader of my party but\nQuite honestly if President Trump and his ability at his age to continue to turn out these performances and the high level of energy to try to rally people for um you know congressional votes where Republicans is simply amazing you've never seen it before President Reagan didn't do this\nYou know President Bush won or Bush to didn't do this you can go back further than that there's nobody does this but the president is just continuing\nTo make this worldwide are not worldwide but nationwide tour of a of rallies in order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about person\nIn order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about President Trump there needs to be said\nBecause he was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when um the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me\nAnd some people mocked importance off Trump's trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if voters turned against Republicans it's going to be a repudiation of Trump\nWhat the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of it is it's not for my lack of effort\nDon't blame me I Am going around and I am doing everything I can to rally support for people to uh you continue to enact\nThe vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy and I am doing it but some of it I cannot do because of congressional obstruction\nAnd I'm doing everything I can to support that Congress and to make sure that we remove the obstructionists\nAnd that would mean the Democrats and we have to not only like I said hold on to hopefully grow\nIf it doesn't happen if we lose that twenty three to ... to twenty seven or thirty seats or whatever it is that is the average and this is what happens in the mid term election\nThe opposite party of who's in the White House loses that number of seats in virtually every mid term election in modern American history political history this would not be a repudiation of Trump it would be a direct\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms if he is able to buck those trends if he is able to stop that that wave from happening\nIt would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history it just would\nHe would be he would be stopping something from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if you somehow heads off\nNot only should we be given all of the praising the world for his ability to ah to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about his own party\nTo keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history\nIn the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it to the\nCaravans why and how quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of caravans he says we're going to stop and he says we will have nothing [noise] so we will not used to stop that\nGoing to talk

scream or excuse me a bigger part in our our well actually they continue to dream about that because why they support them other investigations so much but now that we have\nLiterally evidence of foreign born individuals people from a foreign country trying to impact in American election by way of illegal immigrants being allowed to vote\nIllegal voting labor silent on the issue that doesn't matter that's okay so the president or getting that message out there last night and also talking about I'm speaking of our our relationship around the world look\nWhile the Democrats continue to push for an advocate for open borders and essentially that is what they have done is they are calling for open borders we see it and we hear all of the time\nUh they're arguing that these people should be allowed to come to the United states because we are in should have been a grandson humanitarian this and then when it says humanitarian concerns or the or the you know the model on the statue of liberty and so on and so forth\nUh they they essentially want open borders they want people to be able to come and go to the United states as they please turning it into a world a nation of global nation as opposed to one with sovereignty one that must be protected the president\nStated something last night that it's not going to play well with the people who hate him but the good news is these people already hate him so it doesn't matter what they say when he says this cut Thirteen\nGot to be\nTo do it and you know what's happening right now as a lot of people they caught a caravan

can't let that happen to our country and it's not\nSo the president went on to say that he is a nationalist he is not a global as we missed that part in that clip but he says he is a national is not a global as global is of course are concerned with the worldwide a care of people around the world as opposed to caring for the people\nThat you were voted to support and voted to ah to represent\nPresident made that very clear by the way very early on his presidency saying I wasn't voted president of the world as well as the president of the United states\nAnd that's what I'm supposed to do is represent the interests of the people of the United states rather than the global is the gender advance by the likes of rock Obama he's a hundred percent correct them now as it pertains to stopping that caravan\nThis is very important I Want to make sure you understand this and I know because you're a human's Hugh Hewitt audience the Hugh Hewitt listener you already know

as necessary to the border to keep this caravan of migrants and they're not migrants their invaders marching under a foreign flag trying to cross the southern border eventually\nMarching under that foreign flag and demanding access to the United states that they do not deserve and the president says he will send as many troops is necessary to the border he is one hundred percent correct in doing this by way of two twelve F\nOf immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty two that means he doesn't need Congress he doesn't need a judge to sign off on this the president can stop\nAnd then it's tracks using military if need be because of the powers given and by the Congress quote\nThis is to twelve F quote whenever the president signs that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United states would be detrimental to the interests of the United states he made by proclamation\nAnd for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem inappropriate\nI Want you to take that with you I Want you to share that with every one you know that language you may be familiar with again as I Know he was audience knows most of this but if you don't know this take that with you and share it with every leftist that you know\nIt doesn't say Congress gets to make those decisions it doesn't say a judge has to sign off on those decisions this Congress giving the executive under his own judgment the authority to make those decisions
