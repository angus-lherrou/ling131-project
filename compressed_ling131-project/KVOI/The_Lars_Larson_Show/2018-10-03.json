widely popular inflict commonsense so this followed that masterpiece\nGeneral George Washington found this first as a so inspiring that he ordered it to be read to the troops in valley forge here now is the voice of the late the great Orson Welles\nFrom a pamphlet the first in the series called the American crisis by Thomas Paine written by him to send the Nineteen seventies and\nThese are the

the give them anything and then you heaven knows how to set a proper price up on its good and it would be strange\nIndeed those less chilling article is freedom\nShould not be highly rated\nWhy is it that the enemy of less the New England provinces and made these little ones the seat of war\nThey answered the New England is not infested with toys and we are and what is a tolerate\nGood God what is the I should not be afraid to go with an hundred wakes against the thousand ... were they to attempt to get into 'em every tore the colored when I said oh slay their self interested here's the foundation of tourism man under such influence\nThough he may be cruel never can be brave I wants to build all that\nKind of anger what your man ought to feel against the main principles that are held by the owners I noted when look up the tab on an envoy was standing in the door with is pretty ... and about eight or nine years old as I ever saw after speaking his mind as freely as you talk with food and then they just with this on fatherly expression\nAnd left her mom and to raise four kids without the help of another provider\nBut generally you went to northwestern rose up IBM and became again the c._e._o. and here she is defining the problem to this audience again of governors of all fifty states\nThis is not a world where everybody has to be a data scientist\nIf we have a vision that the only people with good jobs are everyone with a four year college degree or a PHD I think that ... that is not what this world can do\nIt is going to create a division that is even larger in this country between the haves and the have nots you cannot there must be good paying job and I think it's quite possible we play around with a term called new color which said we can see it\nIt's not a four year degree think of it is worth less than a four year degree made you want to call the six year high school you can get a very good productive job in the data economy in many many different fields\nSo we set out on this it's now been six years that we started down this path pointed new power though not little collar not white collar tried to have no stereo types that would be a negative stereotype with this\nBut the problem for students and companies like is it very few schools or other institutions are preparing young people for these new collar jobs\nSo IBM decided to take action with their own pathways in technology program to reinvent education is a public private partnership that spans grades nine to fourteen combining high school college and career\nWe will now be up to a hundred and twenty Texas is going to do another twenty seven states\nOr as as the old pipeline of every grade is full will be more than sixteen thousand kids and the idea is a hundred and twenty school very simple formula and I already know what's working 'cause I've hired a bunch of I'm already if they're coming out the other end up going at it and how long enough so I got ...\nUm the idea is simple pay for your high school with a joint community college\nYou offered the kids the chance to get their high school degree and their associates degree at the same time\nWe as industry public private partnership offer mentorship electronic mentorship for the kids and a chance at a job\nNow the curriculum is not like a trade for the kids are getting a good brought education but it is more practical education there can be hired\nAnd so the kids now are graduating and making double the median income\nOr whether it's not just cyber security job is not to direct I T job digital designers and we've got oh boy now it's up to four hundred other companies across the country helping us with taking on and giving the kids in mentorship an internship they even get internships during paid internships no less a during this\nAnd so to me that's one way for the use I think it's a public private partnership\nI Need the employees everybody I Know the employees I mean the gap of jobs in the country is still millions I just look at cyber security is going to be millions again to go forward and even with now the job that\nWe can bring him back all the jobs that we don't have to train people so to me the really big deal and when you look at the um graduation rates out of the community college for four hundred times better than the average community college graduation rate\nEighty five percent of the kids are either graduating with your associate degree or going on to college we started with the most underserved kids Seventy percent qualify for free lunch or lunch insistence that that that may be kind of a a guide for under served\nAnd they're coming out now so it's really something that I Am so you can tell I Hope so passionate about that and I do believe it's a responsibility I mean we create this it's our responsibility to work public private partnership and and there is no one better to sponsor it there is no love can other than it down there\nAnd by the way that's the sound of big bad business folks\nReaching out speaking out putting their capital on the line and say please help us educators families America we want to fill these jobs and we're here to help with the training with it she said before electronic mentorship we can pipe and a lot of learning from people who are on the job we're willing to give some other time to teach it's like apprenticeship\nVia the Internet we know this is possible right\nWell I never saw set of governors so excited to talk at one of these governors conferences is this was real I solutions without a burden on the tax payers folks here's governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado\nWas one of the IBM executives came and pitch beyond the temperatures in two thousand twelve in pathways pathologist because he ... the fact of but anyway I Love the idea gave this guy leeway\nOn all the time to go out and go out to other states first did it in New York and then showed it to work and then ... will will set up for you guys have got to engage in so we have it in these very school districts to house\nAnd the thing is amazing so it's in one of our school districts is in states Braves valley school districts and uh they're up to their their second year there there are certain school district but they have a little over a hundred kids\nSeventy percent comes from lower and lower income Hispanic households are almost every one will be the first generation first in their generation to go to college so that ability to provide technology pathways to everybody is really the communist one day sure you've got recognized for ah for the leadership so\nThank you for your leadership on it too seriously\nOne hundred kids' lives changed forever and again Seventy percent of those kids in that one school district in Colorado Seventy percent low income households next up governor Larry Hogan Maryland\nWhich started in Baltimore city we found out what you were doing from New York and we should we got to get this in our state and we took on we started with two schools to the most challenged schools in Baltimore city and teamed up with them or city community college I was just there a couple of days ago visiting with the teachers in the\nWith the kids are the students that I can tell you were trying to expand this all over the\nNumber one and we're going to wear the cyber capital of America where your house NSA national cyber Centre of excellence we're Seventeen universities or cyber related twelve thousand I feed companies and so we have a huge need for people with technical skills were doing that all over at every level\nNot just with this was about getting kids into 'em and learning technology the see the faces of these kids who are literally their parents are crying because of the opportunities are kids that might not have ever had any opportunity or any hope for a better future\nThan our mentors and paid summer internships and they're learning and they're excited and they see a future because of this in their first in line for jobs that IBM or one of the company to sponsor it's just incredible program so I Know ... six of my colleagues are already doing it\nUm I just want to thank IBM for the innovation and encourage all of you to take a serious look it's a wonderful program suspect\nIs it's a funny thing you know they are all of the uh education\nIt's a funny thing in the end all of the uh education because part of what we also do that kids learn you know I eat a business Neil what's the appropriate way to dress how do you go to I mean there are many things you teach beyond just the content that she's All right\nBut boy do I never met a parent that didn't want a better life for their child and I never you know it doesn't matter\nYep so true and finally Jenny suggested that we seriously consider how schooling fits into our lives is it really something that we can do in one big shown\nI continue to rethink the education model we are now going to be in a lifelong learning model\nThat is a different world because it won't be the last time and so where we used to think you can finish your grade twelve maybe go on through university they're done in the right to take care of itself I don't know to me I'd given a lot of thought about this need a new\nA new sort of continuous training model that gets put into education really change in every day

retraining it's going to go on I think it's going to be a fact of life or going to focus on\nAnd it is and you know you're thinking about hundred thousand dollars between the ages of Eighteen and
