negative the news\nAnd in broadcast form or negative news somehow it just coincidental I suppose there's not an organized attempt\nTo smear Donald Trump and to destroy his presidency among all of these people in the news media right if it's coincidence they all just happened to feel the same way right now there's a coordinated as ten Ninety One Ninety two percent of anything happens you can probably look at it with a jaded\nNinety two percent of the news coverage of Donald Trump if this news story on in broadcast or in print journalism contains the word Trump Ninety two percent of the time it is negative\nAnd for him to be at forty seven percent approval despite all of that hysteria against him you simply as I said going into break a modern day miracles so they're trying to tear him down it's not working and I just wonder\nAs a as a you know generally so did the journal generally similar just asked me is that uh is this a concern that they really really are nervous that

United states as one can imagine you know who else you know who else said something very very similar to what Barack Obama said in very very similar to what\nDonald Trump has said this guy\nPaul Americans not only in the states most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country\nOh my goodness Bill Clinton you racist how can you say you're disturbed by illegal immigrants coming to this country clearly you just don't like brown people my goodness how can you take people who are just searching for a better life and so casually dismiss them as disturbing the status quo in the United states\nThe jobs they home I'd otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants yeah\nWhite citizens' right that's what you're trying to say\nThe public service that use impose burdens on our taxpayers' oh and\nWe can only use public assistance for a white man I mean obviously\nI'm being talking and she could

things would be apoplectic\nThey would be going crazy on Donald Trump just as crazy Mazie and his Jim Acosta and the rest of them are\nRight now that's why our administrators moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards signed importing twice as many criminal aliens ever before cracking down on illegal hiring side barring welfare benefits steely lately\nWhere have you heard all of these things before my friends\nEvery one of these ideas these policies these initiatives being advanced by Donald Trump and being called racist Bill Clinton impose them in the exact same way in the Nineteen nineties and the left was fine with\nIt in the budget will present you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are\n[laughter]

people coming to this country this is we hate\nThat guy we must destroy Trump at all costs in the same way they pledge to destroy Kavanaugh at all costs that's what this is\nBecause the message he is
