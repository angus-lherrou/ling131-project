and a time when more immigrants were coming into the country than ever before he's a minority and Jewish\nSo already you have a lot of things that people in that time viewed as stacked against you he was an outsider he wasn't thought of as American and yet somehow he became America's first superstar\nAnd he really was that's not really even a debatable statement he was America's first superstar because although there were\nPeople who are famous actors on the stage and later in silent pictures they were famous for portraying other people other powerful people\nWho didn't was famous for who he was\nIs this small Jewish immigrants like Shane can hold he can escape from any\nThat's an unbelievable metaphor and given the time period this isn't a time when most people are feeling depressed most

is Joshua Jay\nHoudini was largely known\nFor the states but truthfully most of the gay for publicity stunt that were done outside in harbors to get people to come to his magic show so this is why he would be seen upside down the straight jacket or doing underwater escape Brittany jobs but in Nineteen away he had a brilliant idea to bring the major escaped to the stage\nAnd this is the one that he brought to the milk can escape it's an original Houdini illusion and this is the original milk that it would go inside the can so only has had with him or and then he would do something really he would say to everybody in the audience\nI have here the biggest stop watching the world and it would bring out of big clock and he would say I want all of you to help me warm up my lungs by holding your breath for a minute with me and he would get everybody in the audience to hold their breath a timer would start and he would go\nTo merge himself into the cat [noise]\nEverybody tries to hold their breath thirty second go by and\nThey learn it's heart he comes up after a minute they kick the can and and now it's really because what does he does he hasn't shown you that what he's doing is

Republicans voting because there are no places to vote there are no schools there is no electricity we are twelve days away for Thirteen Days away from the election they don't even have only place\nAnd they've got no place to go\nI read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this everybody wants to vote they will come and find you unless you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in just called the voter registration let me talk to you about\nUm Martha McSally in Arizona or because I think Christian cinema\nThat is not fit the serve are based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close friends I just can't\nAnd I can't see that being any more than two points in either direction and I don't think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum\nAnd this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out efficient effective border security that has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over borders why is it still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting ah the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants what's so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of a barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border then why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own\nI Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that in my audience is pro fans in pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people who are in the country already we're not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong call fence with a road between it\nAnd I know my I haven't thought about this for Fifteen Years and my idea if they don't find our audiences that are harder line but my audience is very very smart very apple and very educated very a Christian\nVery faith ... people who do not want to punish anyway now Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big firemen and you also it's also the other no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma\nI Know the good that they do the drugs she developed everybody gets that but this pricing\nIs crazy what should a Republican say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies use to do it voluntarily the public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want America is a more than Canadian that if they will not let were dropped\n... the public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want America is a more than Canadian\nThat if they will not let what drug prices here as they've done it in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drought under FDA supervision says nobody wants the height might be poisoned\nBy the Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that won't change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability reminds you of conservatives who believe in the market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of age age has been a guest on my show what he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the uh new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank was\nMore than that needs to be done at least a little public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face low doesn't help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still eat profitable\nBut that people will be able to afford the medications that they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nTired of
