I think I Do just about every single day I I usually mentioned the alliance defending\nFreedom a and I'm asking folks to uh to help them a help Americans are with religious liberty cases I thought would it be great to get somebody from the alliance defending freedom who's in the middle of these battles tremendous battles often with the U.S Supreme Court\nOn the issue of religious liberty something that we understood as a nation but have ceased to understand so now we have to have the court cases\nAre and if it weren't for the lengths defending freedom I don't know how people like Jack Philips domesticate masterpiece a cake shop and others are would defend themselves they wouldn't be able to defend themselves aligned with an agreement stepping up someone to talk to a\nTo match sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for legislative advocacy at the alliance defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me well listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy\nThat had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said\nBoys who identify as girls are allowed to use the Gulf facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show but we've been talking about what the dangers of\nThese policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluids I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the au cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean\n... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah that the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness of about two years ago\nAnd it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child and the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as ... daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as ginger fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as cautious daughter and to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho buddies religion who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nTo me is saying [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIn\nThe earth's axis show and we're talking with Matt Sharp who's a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty\nI'm Matt I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty\nOr in America why do you think it is that what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago you suddenly an issue and alliance defending freedom has to step up\nAnd be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage him and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American\nWell and instead of oh no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these beliefs you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even holding such if\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight\nIf you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote you better get your friends to vote and you better if you can you have to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonize is people of faith\nAs bigoted now again by you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up for everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem to think\nBiblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nAre there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are where the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that\nIs is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want to anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is the man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now\nWe're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this past year Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all of them might in Maine of the state or with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing a view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty of people who have traditional\nValues so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are you know playing these had games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nThe it's now incumbent on your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about the kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who were either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending\nChristians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even\nEnforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to go local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and how they're changing facilities\nAnd all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you\nIf people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say it all the people listening to me right now if this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy\nOr ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government or whatever it is get involved\nAt least vote folks at least\nVote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party of Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream\nAre are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where we have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fund raise for alliance defending freedom or if you\nWant to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks up put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just awful and it's ridiculous and is destroying America so you can go to our website ma taxes talk dot

I Know that there are people out there thinking oh Eric this fear mongering or\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know play to people's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just things like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fine and everything is not find if it weren't for you\nAnd the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her and you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've\nSeen this happen to a young five year old girls a result of this this was avoidable had the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board's saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy\nUm but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just ... and her daughter not just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm

much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle\nAnd you think about teenage kids and it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have unless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have

that I I Want to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what ... was asked to do was disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this says this was absolutely foul\nSexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and was wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\nIf every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in in in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think is a country we need to change our laws\nBut we're talking about right now is as far from that as you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak Philips has not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this\nShould have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously and the ice depending freedom has to defend them I'm Matt this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs\nThis isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying\nWe hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks are one we're fighting the civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody it's just not us against them God Forbid uh the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans it's it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't are so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again

not thinking anything of it and I told them out of the story and she was like shocked they were Rob in the house I didn't know well that's how my working life started\nMy mom and dad were hurt who to properly upper middle class\nSo work was always part one of the kids the dead [noise]\nMy parents eventually when more than I was in high school which was pretty hard\nThere's a lot of sacrifice in marriage and I think when we are so involved in ourselves and the second part of part\nAnd I just think that that kinda happened um\nI don't think the divorce itself was crushing as just to see them slowly and it really wasn't any glue they're really hold\nOr is it self wasn't as crushing as just to see them slowly grew apart and it really wasn't any clue\nThere really hold it together if I had my mom and dad here a lot of a bowl and they still get along fine which is very Dana kids but to see something that you invest in for so much just to be taken apart I just don't think they had any rules of engagement good marriage you know they have that\nAnd so John and I would go downstairs and we would move the upright freezer that's the thing that nobody can move we've already moved like five of them that week and then they would just go like\nWe're so sorry that we question it's like no that's fine but use them in a good tip\nThe funny part was we never got called out because we had no extra guys we had no office so it was like you know or walking a wire without a safety net there but John and I were both pleaser\nAnd this industry was very easy to please people would just do back flips if we if we even showed up or they would just be like oh my gosh against it such a great job just finishing up just like God and so we came here to do so and John and I left\nFor college bridges and job never thought of too many new truck as a career for themselves\nOut no never I mean it was like John I this was barren but money in that order and uh we're drinking green bottle of beer as opposed to it or other guys drink and like the cheap beer John and drink and really good deal that was like\nThe next move up you know phone\nKept ringing off the hook for to mental truck at our house my mom called up to like keep to pay higher couple of guys keep us going and we went out for sure and we came back she bought a new truck and we want with you doing you know we've got payments\nShe bought like a twenty foot truck and John and I would work at school\nBut it really became because it didn't make any money for kids for their money it was fine with my mom London and my mom quit her job at the state of Michigan She had enough I mean\nShe has passed up for a promotion because she was a woman she wouldn't talk to her boss and he pointed out the guy when he is a family to feed like my mom did my mom was divorced\nAnd so she had enough of that world\nShe took all her qualified retirement money attached it all in people were screaming at her own mother and my grandma was just going what are you doing\nThere's a lot of people just said you couldn't do it this is a man's\nWorld the first two years when she quit her job\nShip Paris off anything and just lived

finally made a profit [noise] third year I think\nShe made a thousand dollars and she wasn't sure how to do their taxes because she was like never had a profit\nSo it was the sweetest thing she\nWrote
