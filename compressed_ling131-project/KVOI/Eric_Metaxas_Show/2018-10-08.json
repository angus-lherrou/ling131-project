important show right now if you're listening right now hold on to your hat um because some of you know I've had on this program um are the folks who wrote a book about a Kermit gods now he is without question\nAre the most prolific serial killer in the history of the United states it's horrific but very few people know the story um he was a a late term abortion is\nA working in the Philly area and it's a gruesome gruesome story is behind bars right now of the folks who wrote the book uh are part of um\nA movie they made a movie on this important story it is a very important story which is why I Hope you listen to get the details because he probably won't believe them unless you get them from the people who actually wrote the book I have them on the line now\nAnd uh and failing welcome to the program\nIt's great to be here thanks so much Eric\nWell I I Love you both you you have done it you've really done God's work in telling the story now the most important question I'm going to ask you\nA an is how to how to pronounce your last name\nBlackout heading mackerel Henie Howard yeah that's the topic how why should I take your word for it ... ... and ... year\nAn earth you sound like a an Arabic but tactile\nYou sound like a couple of Irish sons have guns I really do I love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day\nBut you you use your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything\nAbout the story of crime and gun you know obviously the movie is just coming out now it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately I Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us in Salem\nI'm One of the basics give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they have never heard of this\nSo criminal ... go ahead and and I went out onto that'll be that go ahead go ahead there are\n... their parents or Australia or Mary we're not so much in the picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go you go to\nThe curb and God who is an oyster doctor who um is serving three life sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania for delivering babies alive and then and then cutting or next week or so he did this for Thirty years with impunity\nBecause of the establishment who you who who you know who wants to protect abortion said nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact to women and it's like and they still did nothing\nI'm so this is the ... this is the movie is actually about the trial\nThe investigation on the trial if we show nothing gory it's not it's all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode but but I think this is like a credit card Bill Gates I Am and an eerie you know of pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing this and\nThat brings up a lot of questions about\nHow did he get away with it for so long and ... why would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor or Catholic have allowed this to happen during his sharing his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinic which parts of the readers like off the last ...\nOne saw that in\nSharing your taxes\nAre that's early on John I'm late in taxes than I'm Talking to Salem ... in an macko Henie ended I pronounce it correctly that time\nHad a perfect absolutely perfect you're you're you're done very very well or\nAlthough to be honest you quite biased since it is your name so uh we're going to find somebody of jumped to listen you've written an amazing book what is the title of the book\nThe book the book is called and God's though the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer okay and the movie the movie is called God's know the trial of America pick a serial killer\nOkay it's such an important story a and I know it's opening an all across America as we speak I Want to make sure that people understand that sometimes we have an obligation\nTo see what is happening uh in our name this is happening in America are there are other God's nails out there who have not yet been exposed and I think people and especially young people need\nTo see this in World War two when we defeated the Nazis one thing that a U.S troops did us I'm a military leaders\nAre forced the local populations to come into the death camps and to see what had been done in their name they force them to see it so that they couldn't say I didn't know\nOr they would be forced to know now in this country we can't force people to watch this movie but I Want to say folks if you're a parent a you really want to bring 'em your teenagers to see what is happening in America says they can't say oh I don't know we need to understand\nWhat is happening in this movie or does is as good a job as as anything out there in showing what has been happening is absolutely horrifying and uh I I Want us to congratulations to\nBoth of you for pre existing with this because this is this is a big thing to write a book like this to do the research\nAnd I and I know and because we've spoken on this program before it's heartbreaking for you or when you when you encountered the horrors I'd tell my audience for those who haven't heard you on this program before when it was a that led you to tell this story\nYou know at the very center I I it's interesting that you mentioned the Holocaust actually because I often say to people that you know with this abortion story you know sixty million children that have died in America it's very hard for people to kind of get their heads around us\nAnd in some ways I think of our film in some way we do a little bit of what Steven Spielberg fits in Schindler's List\nWhere you know you're a member of that they had the ... tend to kind of washed out ... and ... colored strand except for the war on parts I think that that keep two two parts of the colors I think the flowers as well but it's a little girl wearing a red coat and you'd see her being lands\nAway by the officer and then later much later and certainly when we see that coat on the floor laughing up in a mass grave and I think by ...\nTotal floor and that's in a in a mass grave and I think by personalizing it by making by going into the very very detail of one life that was lost and this film does this go some way to do the same thing because\nAt the center of of the movie is it is the story of a one child who died there ... who was called ... and who you know audiences gets to the ... and ...\nYou know God's will joked about him and all of that and what he got more life because two of\nThe staff taking photographs of ... and ... you know from you ask about me personally\nHeat that baby shares a birthday with my father was born on July the twelfth and you know like my mother used to talk about the hand of God but I Do think it's kind of extraordinary and all the data from the year at the time to read the birthday of this child who or an end date on the same day\nOr two of the workers took a photograph of him and their testimony during the trial in interviews with subsequently\nYou know we're just are very life changing I Would say I mean they didn't know who is one of the people who took a photograph with asked you know I after I had to wear you know and we'll start with the office get arrested you know and she said I Want them to arrest was rescued\nAnd and she was asked also you know why it's taking a photograph why did you do that why did you take photographs and you know and she said I thought he could have had a chance he was so big I thought he could have had a chance I get it how how anyone could listen to test many like ... that was given under oath\nAnd by someone standing who had watched this child live and try to breathe and try to you know try to survive\nAnd he struggled any ... or the other person who took a photograph of cream across described she was asked I mean you know that the idea that this wasn't newsworthy like way beyond me she was actually a cream across it that's a stand up and show that jewelry\nHow to pay the moved how he had moved on how we'd actually curl up in a self help to try to protect themselves because babies at that age you with a little people like that who are like several several months and just station age you know he you know he'd be cold and the lights would be very harsh and he made this movement and she was asked if she stirred up a myth that movements I mean\nIt's it you know that the only thing that you could possibly come to compare this to this is the Holocaust people do need to know 'em\nAnd I edited personal and it becomes personal when you you know can we you know we'll work on the book for a long time we know you know the details of everyone who gave testimony to the life of a child um and even his mother actually who spoke of the trial\nAnd I think they're still\nLooking for a long way to a more placing his life and I Salem says a really wonderful thing actually about ...\nBut you know I'm a person can live a really long life that you could live to be a big age I never do anything significant in your life with this child has already done something significant to even though he lived a very short time he has literally melted hearts and changed hearts that changed hard heart\nI told the story of baby boy in Erie, Pennsylvania where a woman who brought her teenage child who was pro choice and very hard harsh ups and who changed who changed from just knowing the baby and they know when to lie for baby boy it because at the center of it he was murdered\nWhich he could totally it's used in the late ... if he had been killed in the ... so I'm\nYou know stories like this and that we that we tell in the film that I think are are significant and and the reason why we did a ...\nWell I have to say that um you know the the two of you have done tremendous a journalism in in telling this this larger story uh but I have I'm friends with Mollie Hemingway\nAnd with care ... powers both of whom I remember advocating very strongly on Twitter that mainstream media covered this now these are two women uh who are believing the sanctity of the unborn or because of their Christian faith\nUm one is politically liberal one is politically conservative but they both pushed and pushed\nAnd I I I Want to remind people that your voice counts you you have to speak up and I want to say to pastors who are listening or parents\nYou need to bring youth groups to to this I don't know what age would be appropriate but it seems to me the teenagers need to understand what is happening in America what has happened and what the mainstream media\nBecause they are in bed with the abortion industry they sweep it under the rug it is the scandal\nOf our time we we're very happy to talk about scandals of the past\nThis is the scandal\nOf our time is it I think we're going to look back on this and we're going to be horrified and we're going to wonder why didn't we do something well I guess I Want to say to my listeners see the movie tell your friends about the movie you can go to ... movie dot com\nAnd do we know how many theaters this is a opening in in in Salem\nIt's about seven hundred and I'm I'm\nAcross across the nation and I mean I Would say that people when they um when they want to open you know I think a lot of conservatives who came to go to the movies later and\nWe have a week or two you cannot within a week or two Hollywood lost oppose this movie done we'll we'll we work really hard together the seven hundred theaters we need to I wanted to turn out with a big fine\nBy the weekend or an instrument or going to do their best to ignore this film to suppress dissents are it's a it's the figures are going to speak for themselves so we can get on the top five candidates across the United states where\nThe big bang on the opening weekend that will become impossible to ignore the fact that will become a real story that we were successful with the mainstream media just as we were successful uh and raising the money you have the mainstream media just festival making the movie the mainstream media on just as we were successful\nYou know in in in telling and just as a citizen journalist like Mollie Hemingway\nCursing bars where she and she I mean the mainstream media and to telling the story um you know these are these are women these are great journalist cedar tree journalists who care about the truth and she and an forced all the journalists to tell the truth\nWell we all know the name of dietary\nJust on just on the point you had mentioned Derek actually you know we got a PG Thirteen racing though and I would say you know with ... those people can bring very young teenagers of all ages to see this film because\nModerates by couldn't back when the

we decided to make this a crime movie you know because we want it to be exceptional people under is ... first and foremost a crime writer\nUm you know we didn't want this to be a political\nScurried within laws it'd be preachy or pedantic wanted it to be a crime movie in the end of this is my mother was a criminal ah and Americans you know watch a lot of crime on the television law and order CI all these programs MCI yet\nSo we want to be enough John Ross who the ... festival for Americans across across the nation and that's why he chose Andre\n... as I say I I Hope that uh the churches across America will at least\nI take the youth groups to see this because we must teach our young people what is happening in America the media obviously um they're driven by the dollar a day care very little about truth there's a lot of posturing a lot of politically correct\nPosturing but when it comes to things like this are not only don't they care they often\nActively look the other way and I and I think that we as parents and community leaders\nHave to take our young people to see this is absolutely vital that we show them what is happening and they say it's American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that it continued as long as it did how many years was was he operating this house of horrors this guy's now\nWhat's Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know when he got rated with impunity and we know Seventeen of those years several teen of those years no one expected the clinic\nYou know one of the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that and that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know where most proud of enough I think is really important that we and we certainly are very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of ... you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder\nAnd and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who commented on that particular effects but the movie\nAs educational to them as alert they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine at least it's a very highly qualified to work all over the United states of America did not know\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying young people to go because they're going to get an education\nAnd the other side it's just like a law and order episode you have this you know or some doctor on the stand being asked can you describe a legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember fail the night the very beginning of the profits that whatever how that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script was very important to us because we believe\nNo one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd it's important and and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcripts of the trial\nYou know it wasn't you know what would you know writing their you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have it where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on our dish way and I think it's ... it's quite shocking for people
