Andrew Jackson so we can all learn about Andrew Jackson the author is Bradley birds or or maybe it's pronounced Bert sir I'm an African when we get 'em on the phone here but he's a professor of history\nAnd in American studies at Hillsdale College one of our sponsors you know that if you go to my taxes for Hillsdale dot com you can find out all kinds of stuff on on what Hillsdale\nCan do for you because they really want to help educate all of America about what it means to be an American in so many things but we wouldn't be nice maybe once a month we can have them on a to interview one of their professors and we could all learn\nTogether isn't that nice well right now folks on the line Bradley birds or\nOr is it bart's or Bradley Byrne to tell me how to pronounce your name really that's really the first place to start\nThat Eric and we can talk about your last name to shore it my all my relatives say ... but I'll be one of the German beer sir but what are what ... what do they know\nBirds or know how to use and how you say it ... ... yeah just surreal angle size or their well either you make your sometimes you know you said ...\nAnd people go huh no it's birth sir and they kind of you can tell that they're offended you know I I Am here I I if I were in the name cursed in ... and if you say ... she gets offended\nI got a better vaccine problem it's a real problem the problem okay certainly not picky about it really are you really are Bradley jade bird's or of I really am of Hillsdale a college\nAnd uh as you know I'm a big fan of Hillsdale you've written a book on Andrew Jackson and the title is in defense of Andrew Jackson now Andrew Jackson is a storied figure and\nWithout question a controversial figure many people hate him um many people don't know about him I Am one of the latter I have to say I've heard this I've heard that but I'm not someone who knows very much about him uh I Know he was a so called Indian fighter a he's a hero of the war of Eighteen twelve\nUm but there's something about the time at which he was president that sometimes that's a a ...\nOr in people's learning you know we learned about the revolution we learned about the civil war but there's something about the time of Andrew Jackson maybe we missed it uh so I'm really thrilled that you've written a book on him and you can tell us about um so what do we need to know about him and why is your book titled in defense of Andrew Jackson\nShark and thank you so much for having me on I remember very well when you came and spoke ... was a real treat so it's great to make this connection and I also appreciate the bigger playing Ringo Starr that was like\n... and reading a star is a big Jacksonian just in case you're wondering [noise] issues here actually [laughter]\nThat would be great yeah I'm so let me let me just say that he can distance really probably should have\nSo let me let me just say that weekend that fence up really probably should have been title more accurately in context rather than in the sense that there are certain things I think that are indefensible that Andrew Jackson\nAbout one of the reasons I wanted to approach it the way that I did and I I teach the period between the American revolution American civil award Hillsdale every year and it's a it's a blessing to be able to teach that\nOne of the reasons that I went this direction and part of it was a bit Mr this on my part\nPart of it was marketing I've written or he's part but\nI just gotten so tired of how polarized things are and how much ... and has become a symbol really of all evil in early America\nSo I wanted to kind of challenge that and I think there are things about it I mean you certainly Eric for you know blown off\nBy any means I live in a very very different kinds of characters and he's very different from other people are are you a new\nRussell corrupt or by any means but\nHe was a fascinating thing here and I think in so many ways for better and for worse he\nReally was kind of a corporate America at least a great representative of let friends here in America stood for in his own day and age so you know we're not going to be able to stand his sleep holding or some of the things that I Would try to do that but I Do think that there\nI think the issues are very complicated for a time and what I fail to at least in my own experience Eric the only true Jackson's papers\nIn a way that we don't see that often in modern politics he was so honest and just so ...\nYeah there's no there's no hiding with Andrew Jackson you know exactly where you stand with him no matter who you are\nWell as an artist and blunt that's I guess one of the reasons many people have compared Donald Trump to Jackson is isn't that true\nYeah you know there are some similarities I think a bit of course there are differences too I think a lot of the things\nThe bad about Trump especially the kinds of whatever's going on in his life outside of his marriage um that kind of stuff is not stopped Jackson would've done it would have put up with his act so all that it's another I think ... point in his favor how much he revered and twice\nMarriage so ... so Jackson took that seriously what was he did he considered himself a Christian Jackson ... where was he out for him and in in that you\nKnow he's he's Eric it's a great question and he didn't quite a lot about it himself\nBut he narrative very developed which area and and we know that he spent really the last few years of there's life not only as a devout Presbyterian but really spent the last nine years to life doing almost nothing but studying scripture and trying to get ready\nFor the next world and a ... he's a pretty startling guy and I think if we wanted to think of them in that way the best way would be to say originally kind of culturally Presbyterian but then he really grows into it as he gets older\nAnd okay so I Do that for people who know nothing about him and I'm I'm probably one of those sure uh let's I I mean I'm I'm always happy to admit my I'm not happy doing my ignorance but I'm willing willing to admit my ignorance but um ... if somebody says look I Know nothing about Andrew Jackson and why is he ... a great\nFigure why is he on our twenty dollar bill why does he belong there who is he\nA tell us who is he and why would he rise to the level of being included you know on one of our most a used bills I mean that's a really prominent position it's not mount Russia you're right but it's really you can't well what is it about him that led up people in the past to think of him that way\nYeah so you know from the lowly he entered on the scene in the Seventeen nineties publicly he was a controversial figure but just to get you a little bit of background Eric\nHe's morning Seventeen sixty seven and he dies in Eighteen forty five so ... is from the very last president we have who actually fought in the American revolution he was a preteen when he was fighting but he did actually fight as a twelve year old and then as a Thirteen year old and revolution\nBut he's also as the seventh president of the United states needs to be very different type of person than the first six right he's not permit Virginia we got an Adam's from New England\nYeah this is a guy who was from a hardscrabble back frontier country of the Carolinas\nAnd by the Chinese Thirteen not only is he fought in the revolution but he's lost every family member so he's he's in the world totally on his own with no money nothing and he really doesn't build themselves up and becomes kind of great person to Nashville, Tennessee\nReally a kind of old Roman patriarch living there on the frontier and well respected but of course as you mentioned his main internationally is made when he defeats of British during the battle at New Orleans in January of Eighteen Fifteen and going forward is reputation just continues until\nHe is elected popularly to the presidency Eighteen twenty four but he's not actually he doesn't actually attain the White House until Eighteen twenty eight and then he served two terms so if that's a a summary of the hopefully that's a good summer he just got to think about here's this friend tears running the scotch Irish guy who was cut it up\nYour furniture he wrote almost legendary demi God is day like Daniel Boone are ... Davy Crockett certainly have that kind of character but very different than the earlier presidents that we had had\nAll right and so how does he um what what are the things that he did a that would make people hate him or say that we should take him off of a twenty dollar bill\nWell so the two biggest things of course he's not guilty of this alone there were many people who are guilty of this he was asleep older he owns a number of slaves obviously slavery from any perspective as a moral and it's an evil\nBut even with in that he had ... that is he was seen as a ... and with an evil system he was seen as a link slave holder and certainly\nAnd I don't really I I guess I don't understand sorry to interrupt I was gonna say I don't understand all know that becomes an issue because obviously all of the people of that era were slave holders so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know when you think about uh any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and all of them\nAre they were slave holders so I guess I'm thinking they're ... something about him\nThat goes well beyond simply being a a slave owner in an Arab slave holding\nDemographic explosion in fact the largest demographic explosion history of the world happened quite there American frontier I certainly didn't know that that that's a it's a it's an astounding story\nWell it's interesting to me that you teach this period between the wars so to speak in Hillsdale because it really is a for me certainly a a gap in my learning I mean I have little bits and pieces here and there but uh to really think about what's going on in the Eighteen twenties raking thirties I I don't\nI I don't know very much about that time and so it's just fascinating to think of where we were as a country and about this uh ... explosion populations but we're going to be right back folks talking with Hillsdale College professor Bradley birds or the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise]\nHow I Would like

it really is a difficult for us\nToday to defend these actions that seems a palace um but it really is another universe when you think about the world of Eighteen twenty you're Eighteen thirty it's very hard for us\nOr to put ourselves in the shoes of those who lived then because it was obviously a much more brutal world\nTies I think that's absolutely right Eric and you were saying right before break this was an era that you're not that familiar with I think that's true for most people even American historians to individual act that period you know we're always no matter how liberal or PC the profession might be we still like dating everything by our wars\nRight act that there's no major war between the worthy equal to the next war which kind of forget that period\nI Want to get the Mexican war yet so we just\nJump straight to the civil war and most people would go to war well yeah yeah yeah so it\nReally is but what are the things I Love Eric about it and I think it would appreciate this as well this is it time period it's Jackson John Quincy Adams Madison still alive Jefferson still alive or so or throw\nEdgar Allan Poe there are some fascinating people alive at this time right and that that's just to mention whites or you think about some of the Indians like Black Hawk or some of these other guys which is a fascinating time than all kinds of ways\nWell no I can think you know I can think of literary people from that time but as I say when I think of what the world was like first of all\nThe world was you know you you you can hardly think of um what what what would life be like on the frontier compared to what was life like in New York or Boston I mean it's just an amazing time of of growth\nUm so ... what what what are the terms of Jackson's presidency or the year so\nHe was so nice elected in Eighteen twenty eight so it takes office and twenty nine and sitting there for two terms so a gun and thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he is when he was he really is it is interesting because he was even early on I mean I Know I Can't remember where I ... I read it but that ... even as a as a boy a he had controversy you were saying that he served as a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old\nIn the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine\nThat a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing and that that he was captured by the British as as a as a boy that's right ah and and that there was this controversial thing that that he was commanded by a British uh a colonel I guess I clean\nThe British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing many young boy that's very would refused to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nYeah uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him\nWith a sword a ... scarring him on his head\nIn his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being\nOr would you become if you experienced that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe is doesn't excuse a sum sure he did but it's important for us to understand uh\nYou know what life was like in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture\nSo it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who was a ... woman and she died catching a disease helping\nAmerican sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she taught him from day one as low scotch Irish children taught that violence is the way men solve things\nAnd that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people over the Tennessee Kentucky French years it was just very much a part of it\nWell it's just extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen a white and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of the whole life and she\nWell somebody will be put on
