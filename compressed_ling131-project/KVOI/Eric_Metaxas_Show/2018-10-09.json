he's not just a a behind the clouds sees not just a a moral or policemen no no no he actually works\nToday in miracles happen today I've experienced them every now and again I said let me drag on a friend or somebody who's experienced the same thing in today sitting in front of me is my friend rip\nWalberg rip welcome to the program I Can't believe you actually are here in the studio yeah it's supposed to be here than I Do now you live in Lancaster, PA we do okay but to I've met you through can fish who's been on this program many times and I just thought if you're ever in New York I Want to get you wanted to kind of to first of all tell your story\nAnd then to talk about you know some things that you have seemed to encourage people yeah so first of all your story you grew up in Fairfield county Connecticut yeah so did I\nWhat part of fear for cash and get a first in Fairfield than Trumbull in Trumbull yeah okay I'm I'm from Danbury which is the northern edge of Fairfield county but you go there and when did you come to face\nGrew up in church so effectively always feels like you know well a lot of people grew up in the church in that don't mean nothing I mean you grow up in the church but it was real for you yeah it was it was pretty good and yet when I was like Seventeen Eighteen I looked at my parents I said you know I've never actually been baptized\nSo that I get baptized finally when a senior in high school and\nMove on from there you go to church where do I go to know where did you go where a black church\nYou went to blackrock I grew up in blood ... incredible black rock never moved in this miraculous stuff that I was aware of no it was very foreign to me okay so when did you start moving into this miraculous phase so\nUm when I was Fifteen I went on a mission trip with teen missions to Alaska for the summer\nAnd first time I've ever met any real like spirit filled people and I thought well it's a classic kind of story they've got something that I don't have and it's really attractive than if I could have it I Want it\nBut then you have all the how do you navigate the experiential side of it and the reality and the different nuances of the theology that you can't explain at that age but you feel it\nAnd but I still wanted it and so on the way I got introduced to the vineyard and the when I was by the time a senior in high school and you know John was still alive\nAnd John limber you you mean John was using my ... who John is sorry John Limbert Jon Weber is is the man who created the vineyard a and was really used by God\nTo normalize the concept of healing for today deliverance all is great and stuff\nAnd I remember going to a like a charismatic conference in Nineteen Ninety I think it was an Indianapolis or something like that and I heard him speak wow uh this is for today oh yeah but okay so and at what point did you think you'd go into the ministry\nUh when I was Fifteen I thought\nYeah coming off that summer and I remember being on the summer and we're we're in a room in Alaska talking amongst ourselves just about God and how um wonderfully isn't all that he's doing and this and that and a real love for them and while we would do that\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nHey folks from taxes shows miracle Monday on this program and I'm Talking to my friend ripped Walberg\nWho is a a pastor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and rip or how long you been Lancaster\nTwelve years twelve years okay so that the loss of your fourth son aid and when he was four and a half years old that happened while you were in Lancaster yes my but my wife was up here visiting friends in Connecticut at the time and you you said\nThat um some years ago you were at a vineyard conference and you were talking the God about this pain yeah and you were asking him if he had been watching you and I mean obviously you knew we had but it's kind of sometimes we do that when we're praying right we have the obvious\nYeah it's like a son saying that did you see me right and so I was asking him like did you see what I did for you this is a thing between us I Want to be president with you I Want to give you everything but there's like I don't want to hold anything from you but did you see what I did\nAnd I'm In time the word in that moment said I saw what you did and I said did you see how he didn't deny you I sought to give you glory and my greatest pain\nAnd he said I saw what you did and I am incredibly proud of you\nAnd and then he asked me a question you said will you let me touch your pain\nAnd I thought well I haven't withheld it from you but yes you can have all of me and if you've ever heard people talk about the love of the father and that it feels like waves of liquid love that was to me exactly what it felt like just washing over my body and\nMy soul so this was a supernatural experience yeah absolutely was and yet it was as real as sitting right here although I didn't see him\nCould feel everything about it yes\nBut what I'm trying to say like how people speak metaphorically you're you're talking about something that\nFelt uh\nLike it was actually happening to you this is not just something in your mind does this was an actual experience got touched you yes and you felt his love yes um\nIt was not imagine in my head it was physically happening across my body and my soul\nWhen I mean people can only imagine a that when you go do something this painful it has to enlarge your heart and make it possible for you to feel things and see things in a way that you you couldn't before and that's why nobody nobody wants that\nUh it's kinda like nobody wants to be crucified nobody wants to die and yet you say lord here I Am if that's what you have for me I just want what you want for me\nAnd it's hard for us to process the idea that that got allows these things yeah and yet he obviously did allow this in your life and is using it\nYeah yeah it's a hard thing of um you know the odyssey what's the the the issue of pain and suffering in the world when and where it's got what's God's partners so we're kind of have our way of understanding how this happens\nBut nonetheless here we are and we went through this and um I find that\nMany people don't seem to come out the other side\nI find that many people don't seem to come out the other side they survive but they're not thriving [noise]\nWell it's just a it's an amazing thing it's every parent's nightmare to lose a child and ah\nBut I mean I think we need to know that God is with us I mean if if your faith is\nReal then you just know guys with you no matter what we need to believe that because all kinds of stuff comes out of sim life does yeah no question and by the way we all die you know there were nobody escaped that so it's like ... ... ... if you don't really know God\nI'm a win anything happens in life you're lost you don't know where to turn and uh\nWell I guess ... go ahead sorry so\nNo that's fine so he like yes in in that God's Grace was there and knowing him thankfully um I we had him to turn to and yes he sustains\nUs yes all that good stuff but for the longest time I thought um well I yeah I Want to write something but I ... in the time I read a lot of books on grief and how to you know both the the story side and the psychological side and\nAnd um but I thought well what would I Do that's different and so I just kind of waited for a long time um and\nI thought I don't I Can't encapsulate what I Want to say I can feel it but I Can't put it into words and as of recent time it's finally been more forming in me that that um there's hope to survive sorry there's hope to thrive and not just to survive if we'll let got touch our pain\nWow ah well I mean the scriptures is all things work together for good for the love that love the lord and calling creating this purpose and sometimes we can say that a very shallow way but I think it means that if you really are willing to walk with God and allow him to do what he wants to do in you and through you are no matter what you go through\n... has a way of of redeeming it and turning it into something beautiful and profound and more beautiful\nThan you can really imagine and I think anybody who's gone through the suffering a you know would would want to hear that because sometimes you really just to believe these things and you don't get how how it's gonna do it but [noise] I'm good\nSo I've got the ... you know got its been forming like you have the language for but also having gone through this now it's actually been very much in a real way kind of forming in shaping how I personally do ministries what I was up here in New York doing a ... I'm training in meetings on was\nWhen we're ministry new people how do we help them move that pain 'cause it sits in our life in front of us like an idle and we hold on to it in protected because we don't want to feel that again so\nHow do we help people emotionally move that and how is this happening in in the supernatural but in the gods sense and it's a reality in scripture ... how do we help people move that as we're ministry to them in real substantive ways and when we do\nThat I think the impact of freedom and life is actually a lot longer lasting it's really substantive instead of just the peak emotional experience which has a tendency to come and go\nRight now when did you start moving in what we call the miraculous when do you start seeing miraculous stuffed feelings and you know the kind of stuff we see a can fish counts [laughter]\nSome kittens tens unique in so many ways about that yeah so um uh being in the vineyard you you you touch it at least in many ways and but I I found that my ... al ... training in that I'm\nKind of hit a limit and then as I became a pastor a of a church that really wasn't at the time functioning there we had of the logical expression for it but we didn't have faith to go for it\nAnd this is the the vineyard church I Langley extra Pennsylvania yes and does it have a special name or just isn't called sanctuary sanctuary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania ... century of in your church right\nYep so uh I I Begin to want to take the church and the people to that and in one sense it felt like there were like well when did we ever become charismatic and I'm like well it's not about charismatic\nUm per se but at one point I found that I got to a point of I don't know how to get to the next step and so a mutual friend of Ken's and mine had met Ken and I reached out to him and said do you think Ken would help me\nSo I he can basically said yes we started connecting and so really I'm In about two thousand eleven in earnest when I um I had some basis from being stolen in the vineyards but that was when it really currently started taking off and I'm One of tens\nFirst questions to me on the phone was so have you ever cast at a demon\nAnd it's and I I so want it to impress him\nAnd Michael character matters so I Can't lie and\nI said like fishing like what's the biggest ... what's the biggest deem and you've got ugly and like\nSo no not at all and he goes well don't worry it the more you do this where you press into the kingdom yeah if you will yeah and sure enough it was probably within three to four weeks after that all of a sudden that was part of what we were doing\nI mean it's so fascinating 'cause there's so many serious Christians who just don't believe in this and they don't even get near it and I think it's weird or something and they think well no it's\nPretty beautiful because you're bringing really palpable healing to human beings and not ... they're not the same once these things happen yeah so I mean I've seen some of this um but now if if people are now you don't have a book out like you know but you're you're\nTaught I'm writing um yeah in a couple of weeks I'm actually start to outline at an earnest and then go from\nThere yeah [noise] um well I Want to talk about the miraculous because as I say there are a lot of people listening I think your average person believes in the idea of miracles and stuff I just think the challenges are they happening today can I see something\nToday and uh I always say I want to encourage people like absolutely but let's be realistic it doesn't mean that you know right now I mean I've got an e problem right\nPeriodic times right and so but when it's in a culture sometimes there's ebbs and flows\nOf yeah how it's yeah it is in such a mystery and people who don't like mystery\nIt makes them uncomfortable because they want to be able to kind of put it in a box and yes and it didn't look I'm One of those people are you want to figure out how do we do it with the way with it and sometimes it just doesn't work that way and frustrating and why do I pray I pray because I feel like the results are in God's hands\nI cannot for it I cannot force his hand but if we're going to be right back talking to rip Walberg ...

talking about miracles and I was asking you like what miracles of easy for you miracles are kind of normative at this point aren't they like you've seen so much of this stuff\nI I think I've seen but there's still always exciting too and I don't see as much as I like yeah you know I still go up to people knew where stuff doesn't happen yeah you engage in that doesn't happen\nBut have you ever worry ended up in really crazy like somebody pulling a like a silver dollar out of somebody's ear have you ever seen that stuff no not that no because man every time that gets me every time okay but you've seen or what have you seen because there's so many people have never seen anything like\nThis yeah um I I think it's good to to tell some stories not just us but of people like people we know so that it's there's two so I'm the testimony of of some friends of mine were in our city we're downtown and they saw a blind eye open on the street\nIt was it attached to a head or person yes there was it that show person um\nFirst of all a let's be more specific these are friends of yours yes okay they're walking downtown in Lancaster, Pennsylvania\nAnd that yeah that because what we're trying to do is is share the love of God as we go so when we're about our daily life not trying to just the event minded with evangelist and Russia or the guts and so they saw a guy in the ... ...\n... ... ... in the course of their conversation the they realized that he's blind in his says left I just didn't want I yeah I'm just wondering yeah and um so they asked they pray for him and they did and at first nothing happened and then eventually they parted ways but as he was walking away\nThey could see him from behind and he was kept moving his hand in front of his own face and they can see it from back in so he came back up to them afterwards and said when I was walking away from you I can see my I I was doing all this because I could see my eye of a sudden was restored as I was walking away from you\nKnow I always think of people who like by a metal detector and they go down the beach and they're looking for for something you don't need to buy a metal detector you can just pray for people in the name of Jesus and it's not going to happen every time it's like a metal detector like you've got to kind of walk up and down the beach and see and whatever but\nMan when you get something what could be more exciting than the idea that Jesus healed a man's I on the street and only because they pray for him yeah yeah like it wasn't it wasn't you know some big event they just chose\nTo to move and to to to talk to him and then to pray for him [noise]\nAnd and you get rewarded with something that you'll never forget for the rest of your life\nOh my gosh and it's so deeply enriching to her own soul ... it'll make your day you just walk away and you're like you're good for the rest of the\nI've I've had a number of miracles I've ...
