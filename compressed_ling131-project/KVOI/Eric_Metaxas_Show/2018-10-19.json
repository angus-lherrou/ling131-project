educated in England um [noise] uh at Oxford University of London or you came here to the U.S in Nineteen eighty four and um you've been involved in so many different things written so many different

you've been used by God or to really blessed me in our in our friendship I don't mean to um to embarrass you and your reserve Brett you can't stand being\nPraise or in person but it is true that many people have heard me say this story many times that if it weren't for you there would be no Socrates in the city it seems about five minutes ago we were in the back of\nJim lanes car up in Vermont\nAnd you uh suggested to me why don't we have a conversation or I could come and we can do this and I thought there it is and that's\nProbably Eighteen or Nineteen years ago\nWhich is stunning ... your ... your book for the call came out not long before that and you just told me that you you have a twentieth anniversary edition of the call just is it just out now came out this week with four new chapters\nWith for a new chapter is okay that's one of 'em my favorite books have you worked for the call and you spoke\nAbout that in fact he's in a city number of times before we were

being\nRegardless of any other description you might give them of class race size speed intelligence and so on is magnificent and terribly important do they cause you know we talked about as the post truth generation sadly we're becoming the post human rights generation and is more important\nHuman rights are being undermined\nThe whole value of the individual is being undermined you think of a whole lot of mountain views like multi cultural do some more utilitarian is the greatest go to the greatest number they have no place for the individual\nBut my concern tonight as we're looking towards singularity\nAnd post humanism those new hire view of human as to stand against some of the things that are coming so if you go back to see us Lewis establishment man he talks about the final stage of ... generation who think they will make people in their own image\nOkay [noise]\nOne of them may next thing that I Know I Know\nThe thing is easy\nTo show I'm sitting here in Studio with\nUs Guinness are just so happy to be able to say that us thanks for being here my pleasure I Want to talk to you about a mile everything you're just saying that but what you just specifically referenced this book home all day is who wrote that\nYou've all Harare well was freezing it's highly readable and the extraordinary significant in ... and where is you've all Harare he lives in Jerusalem which makes it so poignant he's a Jew\nWriting from Jerusalem the holy city and yet an atheist and says that modern scientists will do better than what he calls the Old Testament God\nNow when when somebody makes a statement like that I think it's really just to sell books because anybody with a brain knows it's absurd to even referenced the idea of God especially if you don't believe in God the idea that we could become God's it's meaningless and others were going to become enhanced animals were gonna become enhanced machines\nOr how how does anybody like this I think that somehow elevates us to be anything more than you know wonderful people\nPut it this way to the bio genetic drive in particular a lot of other things to a refueling the impulse to the tower available\nAnd I'm actually going to stop my talk was stuff on survivor and the other person people putting them up today hugely known in the Nineteen twenties but he wrote in Nineteen sixteen out of the ... World War one the ... little essay\nHe says this is some monstrous moment in history\nThe European spiritual unity has collapsed and the ... will will one but we need to build a new tower of maple and he appeals\nAnd he finishes the ... the ... the final send somebody knows I'm writing to all those who salvation and meaning is just try against the creator\nSo you can now he was he was saying that as a caution Nineteen ... no no no he's calling for it Stephan July yeah in Nineteen sixty now Silicon Valley that is alive and well\nThrough technology and all of Google and other things in give us\nWe will be in that will will we will be gone and you know and you've already talked about seeing mortality\nAnd you can then how much of the Silicon Valley and other efforts today are striving after then people who think they may live for a hundred and fifty two hundred and some say ten thousand yeah and so no it's a deliberate attempt to become as God\nWell but that doesn't just live ten thousand years he lived forever and so I still find it funny because\nYou know whether you live forty years or eighty years or a hundred and Twenty years or a hundred and fifty years you're still die and so all you're doing it's like saying I can make your eyesight even better do you think will be great but you'll never enabled me you know to see beyond the stars or to the ... it's it's ... to reference God\nStrikes me as just ditch cheeky ah you know it's one it's one thing to say we\nUsually I'm Francis Collins given incredible lecture in D.C this week ed covering the buyer genetic suffer the future pointing out the ... some magic gene editing\nIt cold some magic gene editing while you just said tackling problems so you overcome outside so Parkinson's or whatever right we're all for that right between that and what are your cold um germ line gene editing right\nTo explain his because I've had some people talking about this this is not so easy to understand well you're in line gene editing and when he was\nThat you change everyone in future generations and this is exactly what see us loses talking about in the evolution of men you will have a ... generation who thinks their views of conditioning humans will be the better way of being human but all humans often that will be shaped by what they've\nPut into play I guess my ... and there was this speaking for future generations this is the ultimate elitist totalitarianism\nWell my my question is what are the what are the parameters here another vote say somebody says I can eliminate glaucoma\nI'm more cataracts by gene editing and not only will be eliminated but hundreds of ethic but you know but it but I'm saying if your children will also not have that isn't that germ line gene editing\nOr you'd have\nTo bring from sue someone to discuss the details that I guess you don't quite clear that's the difference so and I ate says no to certain things with CRISPR editing and that's important most of the Chinese\nDon't have those ethical bender she remembers Dracula which many years ago with technology if it can be done it will be done yeah I mean if we don't do someone else to do it with a for profit or whatever and we were in that so the world but the point is this new ethical boundaries today\n... Lewis was attacking what he calls subjective is some\nBut the ultimate subjective ism Fabio ... says what's called social construction is and what you can see say in the transgender debate there or you know the three little principles no givens\nNo rules no limits\nSo male and female out that is no longer a given nothing is again that's extremely radical that is Lewis is subject to visit him at a creators level\nAnd that's what we're moving towards the front says says if people can you know with CRISPR editing insulin designed children as they like because we'll be at the mercy of the Lewis calls the condition is we would call them control those ... so called them the Guardian's\nWell when you when you mentioned I'm just now that uh was it ... who said that you know if we can do it we will do it right that the idea that or\nNot if we because we might of ethics if\nIt well it emitted I'm yeah I'm saying if if you ... are capable of it then they will someone will will do it though I guess when we're talking about the ethics here obviously a science cannot tell us whether we ought to do something you can only tell us what we might do but it but it can't really\nPrescribe what is good what what is bad\nAnd so when you talk about something for example like uh the transgender issue a\nWithout ... I guess my question is don't people see that a DNA tells us I mean if I take a drop of blood from somebody from their selves I can tell whether they're a male or female\nAnd most people know that that is you can you can tinker around I can get a different hairstyle I'd be dressed differently I can I add things are cut things off from my body but the end of the day there's no way I Will ever be able to to beret childhood\nAm I on the transgender extremes uh extreme another was until this point they said we can replace revolution the Bible and all that with science but with the transgender extremes\nFeelings override biology yeah now that the cost goes back to those people I joined jak Russo if you read a meal he says\nWhat I feel is good is good what I feel is bad is bad\nAnd that's again and emotionally called his motive isn't technically but you're into an incredibly dangerous world where even sciences over written in the name of the power and the pleasure of those who have the power the elite that's incredibly dangerous right\nAnd and to get back to where we are saying originally that it unless you believe we're created in the image of God it seems inevitable that things slide in this direction and say you say that some people are aware of this\nWell there's a catch twenty two I mean one man puts like this the greatest obstacle to announcement is the view that humans have sacred yeah the fact that humans are considered sacred is the only barrier to the dehumanization that may come there's a catch twenty two\nYeah well at the dehumanization you talked about elites I mean the idea that some people would be able to\nUm have children that are enhanced I mean obviously the technology will probably enable us to have the children that are smarter that are taller and stronger you know that that's something that a ... that Internet itself is not so horrifying what's horrifying or is that\nIf you only believe that we get our value from what we're able to do a then if we don't have inherent value then obviously does create a pecking order which ... which is the enemy of freedom and democracy\nYou remember earlier it was that view among liberals like H. G. wells and Margaret Sanger and people had that which led to eugenics and all sorts of things like that and if Hitler had not given it a bad name\nIt probably would have gone wrong and it's significant now the of people like Richard Dawkins who own most talking as if that back to that sort of world again right and that will come in\nIn other words the the new polished up version of eugenics and so on well\nI mean it follows logically we know that uh if\nIf you take away the biblical worldview it really does lead to the death camps I mean we have to make that case over and over and over again that the Nazis were only consistent ... you know what if you say there's no evil or good or anything like that then why\nAnd we need to understand how it came through the rough and

our land [noise] a table\nWith Houdini ten cups was set near the edge of the room with the Hollywood Sign as prominent dramatic backdrop lit up in the distance of the Halloween Night\nNow the final plea to the great to do to appear spirit for\nAbout\n\n[noise]\nBut anyway\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nJoshua Jay's is successful magician and respected Harry Houdini expert joined us from the contemporary Jewish museum in San Francisco\nAll right so let's talk a little bit about putting in a metaphorical fats who is going to any lenient five foot three he's considered at this time period an outsider Hungarian\nAn immigrant and a time when more immigrants were coming in the country than ever before he's a minority Jewish\nSo already you have a lot of things that people in that time viewed as stacked against you he was an outsider he wasn't thought of as Americans and yet somehow he became America First superstar\nAnd he really was that's not really even a debatable statement he was America's first superstar because although there were\nPeople who are famous actor is on the stage and later in silent pictures they weren't famous or portraying other people other powerful people\nWho do was famous for who he was\nHe's this small Jewish immigrants like Shane can hold he can escape from anything\nThat's an unbelievable metaphor given the time period this isn't a time when most people are feeling depressed most people are feeling like there's this feeling to how high they can write here's a man without education without any money is the ultimate rags to riches story\nFrom Nineteen oh seven inch around Nineteen ten Deanie performed was reached success in the United states you freedom cell from jails handcuffs chains ropes and straight jackets optimal hanging from a rope inside of a street audience or out in front of a major newspaper for the extra publicity\nBecause of imitators Houdini put his hand tough act behind him in Nineteen OH began escaping from a locked water filled milk him here again is Josh ...\nWho was largely known\nFor the states but truthfully most of the state for publicity stunt that were done outside and harbors to get people to come to his magic show so this is why he would be seen upside down the straight jacket or doing underwater escape British jobs but in Nineteen oh eight he had a brilliant idea to bring the major escape to the stage\nAnd this is the one that he brought to the milk can escape it's an original Houdini illusion and this is the original milk that he would go inside the can only has had with him or and then he would do something really he would say everybody in the audience I have here the biggest stopped watching the world and they would bring out a big clock\nAnd he would say I want all of you to help me warm up my lungs by holding your breath for a minute with me and he would get everybody in the audience to hold their breath a timer would start and he would go\nTo merge himself into the past [noise]\nEverybody tries to hold their breath thirty seconds do by and\nThey learn it's heart he comes up after a minute they kick the can and and now\nIt's really because what does he does he hasn't shown that what he's doing is impossible like most magicians is showing is that what he's doing difficult and real and that in the way that everybody remember even if there were three thousand
