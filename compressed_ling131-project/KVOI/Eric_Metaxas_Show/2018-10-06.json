[laughter] ... and Salem macaroni or\nAn earth you sound like a an Arabic but tactile you sound like a couple of Irish sons have guns\nI really do I love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day\nBut you you use a your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything\nAbout the story of Kermit got nailed obviously the movie\nIs just coming out now it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately I Hope that and it's why I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us and in Salem I'm One of the basic give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they have never heard of this\nCriminal who is going to get onto this will be ... go ahead and go ahead around\nThis has this apartment or Australia or married or not so distant driver's license such isn't a picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go to\nThe curb and God who is an or say doctor who um is serving three light sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania for\nDelivering babies alive and then and then cutting or next week or so he did this for Thirty years with impunity because of the establishment who who who you know who wants to protect abortion that nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact two women died and it's like and they filled it nothing\nI'm so this is this ... this is the movie is actually about the trial the investigation on the trial it we showed up and gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like\nA law and order episode but but I think this is what a credit card Bill Gates I'm On a jury you know of pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing that and\nThe film brings up a lot of questions of art how did he get away with it for so long\nOr ... why would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholics have allowed this to happen during his sharing his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinic which was part of the reasons like off the last ...\nWatson discovered earlier um you know there's also the question that the story brings up and walked the least of which is how the media ignored that this happened once the story could break and water and the courts in Philadelphia how\nOne saw\nDown\nJerry ... show\nA that's early on John I'm late ... talking to Salem ... in an ... an did I pronounce it correctly that time\nHad a perfect absolutely perfect you're you're you've done very very Well Eric\nAlthough to be honest you quite biased since it is your name so uh we're gonna have to find somebody objective ah listen you've written an amazing book what is the title of the book\n\nThe book the book is called and God's though the untold story of America's most prolific serial killer okay and the movie the movie is called God's know the trial of America pick a serial killer\nOkay it's such an important story a and I know it's opening a all across America as we speak I Want to make sure that people understand that sometimes we have an obligation\nTo see what is happening uh in our name this is happening in America are there are other God's nails out there who have not yet been exposed and I think people and especially young people need to see this in World War two when we defeated the Nazis\nOne thing that a U.S troops did us I'm\nA military leaders\nAre forced the local populations to come into the death camps and to see what had been done in their name they force them to see it so that they couldn't say I didn't know\nOr they would be forced to know now in this country we can't force people to watch this movie but I Want to say folks um if you're a parent a you really want to bring 'em your teenagers to see what is happening in America says they can't say oh I don't know we need to understand\nWhat is happening in this movie uh does is as good a job as as anything\nOut there in showing what has\nBeen happening is absolutely horrifying and uh I I Want us to congratulations to both of you for persisting with this because this is this is a big thing to write a book like this to do the research and I and I know and because we've spoken on this program before it's heartbreaking for you ah when you when you encountered\nThe horrors I'd tell my audience for those who haven't heard you on this program before when it was a that led you to tell the story\nKnow at the very center I I it's interesting that you mentioned the Holocaust actually because I often say to people that you know with this abortion story you know sixty million plus children that have died in America it's very hard for people to kind of get their heads around us and in some ways I think of our film in some way we do a little bit of Steven Spielberg in Schindler's List\nWhere you know you remember that they had this set be attentive to kind of washed out ... and ... colored strand except for this war on parts I think that that keep two two parts of the callers I think the flowers is well what does a little girl wearing a red Colton you'd see her being lands\nAway by Nazi officer and then later what shape it and so even if he got caught one floor and that's in a in a mass grave and I think by ... by making it by going into the very very detail of one life that was lost and this film does this go some way to do the same thing because\nAt the center of of the movie is it is a story about one trying to attack their baby boy who was called ... and who you know audiences gets to the ... and you know about\nYou know God's will joked about him and all of that and plus he got more life because two of\nThe staff ticket photographs of ... and ... you know from you ask about me personally\nThe heat that baby shares of course with my father\nThat baby was born on July the twelfth and you know I my mother used to talk about the hand of God but I Do think it's kind of extraordinary and all the tape and the year at the top report their child who or an end date on the same day or two of the workers took a photograph of him and their testimony during the trial and interviews with subsequently\nYou know ... are very life changing I Would say I mean Adrian ... who was one of the people who took a photograph with asked I asked her I said to her you know and we'll start with the office getting arrested you know and she said I wasn't arrested was rescued\nAnd and she was asked also you know why it she taking a photograph way to do that why did you take photographs open and you know and she said I thought he could have had a chance he was so big I thought he could have had a chance I get it how how anyone could listen to test many like ... that was given under oath\nAnd by someone standing who had watched this child live and try to breed them try to you know try to survive\nAnd he struggled any ... or the other person who took a photograph of cream across scribes she was asked I mean you know that the idea that this wasn't newsworthy by the way beyond me she was actually a cream across to stand up and show the jury\nHow to be moved we moved and how we had actually credit themselves up to try to protect themselves because babies at that age with a little people like that who were like several several lumps in just station age you know he you know he'd be cold and the lights would be very harsh\nAnd he had made this movement and she was asked if she stood up and made that much I mean it's it's you know that the only thing that you could possibly come to compare this to is the Holocaust and people do need to know 'em\nAnd I and it is personal let it becomes personal up when you you know can we you know what works in the book for a long time we know you know the details of everyone who gave testimony to the life of a child um and even his mother actually who spoke up a trial\nAnd I think it's still looking for a long way to ... his wife and I Salem says a really wonderful thing actually maybe ...\nBut you know I'm a person can live a really long life that you could live to be a big age and never do anything significant in your life what is China's already done something significant to even though he lived a very short time he has literally melted hearts and change hearts that changed hard heart I told the story of baby\nOur son changed hearts that changed hard hard\nI told the story of baby boy in Erie, Pennsylvania where a woman who brought her teenage child who was a pro choice and very hard harsh ups and who changed could change from just knowing the baby and they know when to life ... ... at the center of it he was murdered\nWhich he could totally ... and ... ... if he had been killed in one so I'm\nYou know stories like this and that we that we tell in the film that I think are are significant and and the reason why they did a ...\nWell I have to say that um you know the the two of you have done tremendous a journalism in in telling this this larger story\nUh but I have I'm friends with Mollie Hemingway and was curious than powers both of whom I remember advocating very strongly on Twitter that mainstream media\nCovered this now these are two women are who are believing the sanctity of the unborn or because of their Christian faith um at one is politically liberal one is politically conservative but they both pushed and pushed\nAnd I I I Want to remind people that your voice counts you you have to speak up and I want to say to pastors who are listening or parents do\nYou need to bring youth groups to to this I don't know what age would be\nAppropriate but it seems to me the teenagers need to understand what is happening in America what has happened and what the mainstream media because they are in bed with the abortion industry they sweep it under the rug it is this scandal\nOf our time we we're very happy to talk about scandals of the past\nThis is the scandal\nOf our time that I think we're going to look back on this and we're going to be horrified and we're going to wonder why didn't we do something well I guess I Want to say to my listeners see the movie tell your friends about the movie you can go to ... movie dot com and do we know how many theaters this is an opening in in in Salem\nThey told me about seven hundred I'm I'm across\nAcross the nation and I mean I Would say to people when they um when they won it opens you know I think a lot of conservatives tend to go to the movies later\nWith a week or two you come up with it or weaker to Hollywood wants to close this movie darn well we'll we work hard together the seven hundred theaters we need are willing to turn out with a big fine\nAbout the weekend or an instrument or going to do their best to ignore this film to suppress\nDissents are it's a it's the figures are going to speak for themselves and we can get on the top five of the skin it costs you know it was\nA big bang on the opening weekend they become impossible to ignore the fact that will become a real story that we were successful with the mainstream media just as we were successful um and they're the the money you have the ministry of media just festival making the movie without the mainstream media on just as we were successful\nYou know in in in tally and just as a citizen journalist like Mollie Hemingway crushing ours were sham sham mainstream media and to telling the story um you know these are these are women and these are quick journalist feed it through journalists\nWho care but the truth and she and forced all the journalists to electric\nWell we all know the name of dietary\nJust on just the point you had mentioned the rhetoric actually you know we got a PG Thirteen racing though and I would say you know with ... those people can bring very young teenagers of all ages to see this film because\nModerates I couldn't buy from the conventional wisdom was how to be a moderate but at what they need to remember that Eric portrays\nThe moderate I Do yes they do\nAll the consultants told told what very wisely that oh you oh you have to be moderate you after ... ... have been in Ohio yeah well that yeah they will sell the work that\nWe're going to go we're going to go to another break hang on a folks I'm Talking to and macaroni and

little about truth there's a lot of posturing a lot of politically correct\nPosturing but when it comes to things like this are not only don't they care they often\nActively look the other way and I and I think that we are as parents and community leaders\nHave to take our young people to see this is absolutely vital that we show them what is happening and they say it's American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that he continued as long as it did how many years was was he operating this house of horrors this guy's now\nWhat Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know when he's operating within the and we'll at Seventeen of those years several teen of those years no one expected the clinic\nNo one of the department of health decided to to to see you know to do that and that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country I mean one of the parts of the film that we you know where most proud of what we think is really important that we only certain ... were very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of climate or do you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder\nAnd and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who commented on that particular effects that the movie as educational to them as learn they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine at least it's a\nVery highly qualified to work all over the United States Americans get knocked no\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying young people get to go because they're going to get an education and it's just that it's just like a law and order episode you have this you know of course your doctor on the stand being asked\nCan you describe a legal abortion to the to the jury I remember feeling the night at the very beginning of this process that whatever happened that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script that's very important to us because we believe no one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd it's important to 'em and no one can criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know what would you know rising there you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have it where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on varnish way and I think it's it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know that subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that\nOne thing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so
