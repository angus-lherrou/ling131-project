thousands of foreigners marching\nThis show and a few weeks ago I was in\nGreece every year and then I can I go to Greece I Am Greek my dad grew up there and uh it's a joy for me every year a but in the last number of years it's been kind of tough because of the Greeks as you know if you read the papers\nHave been going through hell financially they effectively sold their souls to the European Union everybody was saying oh you got to do this at the time and it has been a rough\nUnpleasant ride I have views on this but a better than hearing my views I Am on the line Paul Roberts uh you may know him from his writings are in the uh\nUh in the rain in ministry and uh he was assistant secretary the treasury for economic\nPolicy a he has written many many things and served in many many capacities and he is now writing among other things and one of the things that I read was an article he wrote called genocide of the great nation and it is my ...\nAm on the line Paul Roberts welcome this program on a factor but\nI just have to ask you this article and I rented it it blew me away so if you would maybe reprise diseases of it for my audience who are unfamiliar with what's going on in Greece\nWell that's a long story\nUm for the first time I think\nAn indebted country instead of having the creditors right down the country's debt to a level that the country could service [noise] some managed to use uh the IMF\nAnd the European Union and the European Central bike\nA pressure from the German and Dutch finance ministers to force the Greek people to pay the debt and the way they pay the debt was\nIn these ways [noise] um they were forced to have um the pensions got to have a social programs cut education caught\nUm the government was forced to lay off a government employees\nAnd the money saved by not paying the full pensions and by not paying the full social service bill and by firing people went to service the debt\nAlso ah the Greeks were forced to\nSell off a national assets for example municipal water systems but we're you know owned by the municipality\nWell I'm just questioning I mean I Want to ask you is I think my audience is probably wondering okay so what is wrong with everything you're describing why was that bad what ought to have been done instead of what you're saying\nWell that's what I've said to getting a traditionally these problems are always solved by the uh [noise] creditors writing down the debt\nFor you mean for all are giving them and the death service\nYou see the people themselves didn't contract the death [noise] now you get an argument from these right wing crazies that uh all the people benefited from it and so they should have but they didn't because most of this that\nWas a product of corruption above a in a among the creditors out among the governments are very few of which were democratic [noise]\nFor example a it's a German but a garden bikes would show up\nAnd there would be talking to the great leaders and they say hey you know why don't you bar\nA all this money from us and here's a bag of money while you think about it and then you can use all the money borrow from us to buy some new German submarines for your navy [noise] so that's the kind of transactions that a lot of this debt [noise]\nI was a car I guess like when I'm when I'm trying to understand though is um [noise] uh when\nThis was going on I mean it seems very clear to me that this was all wrong that this was a horrifying and as somebody a with relatives who are suffering as a result of this uh\nI I really I'm as I said at the beginning I think the Greeks getting involved in the European Union in the first place was a bad idea but I I guess my question is what do you think is going on with the leadership than the European Union that they would do this\nTo Greece do you think that they are are they just being a nap or are they being ... various ah where are they are they doing things that they think are good but but that aren't good what what do you think is going on in Brussels that they would do this to destroy this nation\nCourt to thanks a line is that countries that are members of the ... you have really given up this already\nBut goes they no longer have their own money except for the British had enough sense to keep the British pound so a lot of the other countries the French fries is gone the grid ... well I think it was the German mark all all of this is gone\nAnd so the governments of the country and no longer create money to services that [noise] and so they've already lost their physical independence and so what year was doing was\nA it bans during this centralized leadership of governments\nIn Europe in into the ... year so by forcing a the Greek government to pay all the great people service debts that country couldn't service\nFor the centralized this principle that you\nControls fiscal policy all the countries that they\nDo not have been the tax and budget ... self so is\nThis not a a kind of a reverse American Revolution in other words you had these independence day there existed they were sovereign nations and then you have a bureaucracy or a kind of global list bureaucracy that he's using its power\nTo suck these sovereign nations away from their sovereignty and into becoming part of something larger we always\nIt's a fact we actually just what the American Revolution there doing it set up the central government and for ... saw the stage to give up some of their sovereignty to the central government and then through time\nMore and more of this ... was forced a states were forced to give up to the central government until the day for example the tenth amendment which reserve all sorts of powers to the states it was a dead letter amendment and that's what's happening now in your ear\nGreece will be a positive sense of the European Union so well France or Germany\nSome provinces will be more powerful and just like in the United states California's powerful province New York is a powerful problems [noise]\nBut they are all a have lost their power to two ... two elements so this was one of the purposes of forcing the grid and through the kind of austerity has so badly\nOr reduce living standards are created extreme poverty forced a lot of women and prostitution and all cause massive exodus of Greeks from Greece\nOr in the fact is a very destructive\nA policy now at the finish answering your question the other reason for it was at the financial shutters courted to establish a new policy that if we make bad loans is not our fault we don't have to write them down\nThe people in the country who is the government may alone so they have to pay [noise] so you had the financial interests and use interest\nGanging up on Greece and they chose to race because well it's a relatively small country in the south you're\nAh not much power not much influence and so they said okay we'll start there and then we can move at all to other countries like Portugal Italy\nSo you do that this was playing by the emu the heads of the year\nUm I don't know that they plan Greece's indebtedness but when they saw the bottle and they knew how to use it for their reason\nThat well that's what I'm saying that manage to where it's right\nThat you know the great people now it's not clear what a what they can do for girls ... countries route\nWell I'm not sure what you mean by that took to what extent is it ruin what what well actually we're going to go to a break when we come back we will continue this line of questioning folks and talking to

successful magician respected Harry Houdini expert joins us from the contemporary Jewish museum in San Francisco\nAll right so let's talk a little bit about containing a metaphorical sense who is going to any Houdini it's five foot three he's considered at this time period an outsider Hungarian\nAn immigrant and a time when more immigrants were coming into the country than ever before he's a minority in Jewish\nSo all ready you have a lot of things that\nPeople in that time viewed as stacked against you it was an outsider he wasn't thought of as American and yet somehow he became America's first superstar and he really was that's not really even a debatable statement it was America's first superstar because although there were\nPeople who are famous actor is on the stage and later in silent pictures they were famous for portraying other people other powerful people\nWho he was famous\nFor who won\nHe's just a small Jewish immigrants like chains can hold he can escape from anything\nThat's an unbelievable metaphor given the time period this isn't a time when most people are feeling depressed most people are feeling like there's this feeling to how high they can write here's a man without education without any money at the ultimate rags to riches story\nFrom Nineteen oh seven inch around Nineteen ten Houdini performed with reached success in the United states you freed himself from jails handcuffs chains ropes and straight jackets off the wall hanging from a rope inside of a street audience ... out in front of a major newspaper for extra publicity\nBecause of imitators Houdini put his hand tough act behind him in Nineteen await began escaping from a lost water filled milk him here again is Joshua Jay\nHoudini was largely known\nFor his escape but truthfully most of the skates for publicity stunts they were done outside in Harvard to get people to come to his magic show why he would be seen upside down the straight jacket or doing underwater escape Brittany jobs but in Nineteen oh eight he had a brilliant idea to bring the major escape to the stage\nAnd this is the one that he brought milk can escape it's an original Houdini illusion and this is the original milk that he would go inside the can only has had with him or and then he would do something really he would\nSay to everybody in the audience I have here the biggest stop watching the world and it would bring out a big clock\nAnd he would say I want all of you to help me warm up my lungs by holding your breath for a minute with me and he would get everybody in the audience to hold their breath a timer would start and he would go\nTo merge and south into the cash [noise]\nEverybody tries to hold their breath thirty seconds they'll buy ants\nThey learn his heart he comes up after a minute they kick the can and and now\nIt's really because what does he does he hasn't shown you that what he's doing is impossible like most magicians is shown is that what he's doing physical and real and that is a way that everybody remember even if there were three thousand people in the crowd could\nUnderstand and identify on a very intimate level so real danger that he was in\nThe region as magician Joshua ... with the details on how exactly the ... and worked\nSo this is how the illusion would work he would say after a moment of meditation\nI Wanna hold my breath much wrong and it would re submerged six assistance with place the top on the hand and then the last six had locks on the side a small courting one place around if this was to protect the secrets of his illusion remains of secret for this day\nAnd then the clock starts after a minute almost everybody in the audience couldn't hold their breath after two minutes a skeptic stare at the three minute mark\nThe theater manager would come out with an accent his hand looking very confused like this never happened before and of course it happened every night at the same exact\nWay this is ...
