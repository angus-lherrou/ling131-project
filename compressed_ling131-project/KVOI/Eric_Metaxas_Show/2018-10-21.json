just it now they did that too\nYes and hundred and twenty thousand dollars and that one's going to show people that do they have any money for a down payment because they make too much\nAt all about to change all of them\nWere in but what worries me about that Kathy is are we going back into the area which got us in trouble which is a no no in a very very little money\nAnd I work at night and it was that we were doing\nWhen he does that yeah that was terrible\nAre we what are we are if they're relaxing the standards are we going back to [noise]\nRelaxing standards are we going back to\nYou know you know they they they do a lot of research on who\nYou know and honestly they're not alone\nThere are going to be a little tighter so yes they if you have to credit score didn't look at you look at your employment they know me\nAs far as not having any or closures and a hundred percent financing and like we did it but yeah they're all in the in a more ... these people really want to be alone and I think people care a little bit more now\nTwenty years ago out their credit and you know building up so I think they really researched it they're just handing out it was it that\nThat means less money for you and me when we walk into the bank to borrow money and it since they have less money they're going to be more particular about who they lend to so credit scores and all of that are going to happen to be higher or you're not going to have a chance of getting a loan down the road\nYeah it's gonna be a credit crunch or for normal people and they ... as well yep I'm telling at least ...\nAll my friends and everyone around me don't don't have any dead don't as they'll buying major assets and the next couple of years just wait because everything's going to get a lot cheaper and then they made a lot of people left holding the bag and it's not going to be good for those people\nWell they've done a pretty good job I've got to give the fed credit for I mean it was an experiment and they did a pretty good job of of trying to patch through the recession of two thousand eight\nI'm bringing the question is how do they unwind that and that's always been the question of how do they get out of what they created and we'll see how skilled they are doing it but they've got to do it\nIn a slow drip drip drip fashion yeah\nWe'll see how they do All right Richard I appreciate the call\nEight five five to nine five\nSixty six hundred John ah Reno nevada Hello John\nI um I I think we've had this conversation before but I think the main focus now should be that get the corporate taxes back up again they once I'm thirty five percent affect the right to twenty but\nThe way that corporations were basically they're not putting in anything into the federal budget now they're getting out of all the taxes and they made an eight trillion dollar profit in twenty Seventeen\nRight so I mean\nWell I was standing about three trillion a year with the government\nSo the idea is that corporations can make a trillion and not pay that anything into the system you know the lows the labor air quality everything you know they've got to pay their fair share even before the system I always thought it was fifty fifty but when I looked at\nThe taxpayers are still putting in over eighty percent of the budget ... finance at about one that I was telling them that are paying anything into the says oh no no\nNo no no no the the look at corporations have always been the small portion of revenue for the for the federal government individual income taxes have always been the biggest they always have been so by dropping the corporate tax rate you're not going to change that much revenue\nDo or the federal government but what what do corporations do they provide\nJobs are they hiring obviously unemployment rates down to the lowest levels since Nineteen fifties I think it is I mean this this is the ... you have to look at the other side of the coin there is a benefit\nFor corporations to be sitting there and especially banks having losing money because if you want to go in and borrow money even though interest rates going up they will have the money to do that\nBut if you wanted to have them send all their money off to the IRS\nThey're going to be much tighter on making loans\nI look at it I I think it's a good thing that I think corporate rate should go to zero and you also have always heard about the fact corporations don't pay taxes\nThey just as whatever the cost of the taxes onto their products and services so I as usual John you and I are on opposite sides of the argument on this thing but I\nI don't see why corporate taxes exist at all I think it should be zero\nThe more money they have to say well why do you think are unemployment rates gone so low who hires people the ...\nThe unemployment rate\n[noise] [noise] the unemployment rate\n[noise]\nSixty percent of the people are not even in the workforce in the war [noise] we have\nNow we have a participation rate or close to Seventy but that's another fact but the point is\nCorporations are not the evil bogeyman that you want to make them out to be they provide\nTo our economy a benefits that are other than the rate that they pay to the federal government on their income all that has passed through to their servers are in their products\nUh I I think you ought to take another look at the corporate America but John ah I Do appreciate your call\nWe go round and round on this line there's always people out there that that hate corporations they don't know why\nThey're just uh we just know they're begging they make a lot of money and so therefore they should pay more money or if they do what are the what's the the cause and effect for the cause and effect of lowering their taxes the cause of doing that has led the effect of lower\nUnemployment more jobs\nPhone number here date by five to nine five sixty six hundred you can find my phone number lengths to the show on my
