about Andrew Jackson actually I'd like to talk with the author of a book about Andrew Jackson so we can all learn about Andrew Jackson the author is Bradley birds or or maybe it's pronounced Bergstrom and ask him when we get 'em on the phone here but he's a professor of history\nAnd in American studies at\nHillsdale College one of our sponsors you know that if you go to my taxes for Hillsdale dot com you can find out all kinds of stuff on on what Hillsdale\nCan do for you because they really want to help educate all of America about what it means to be an American in so many things but we wouldn't be nice maybe once a month we can have them on a ... interview wanted their professors and we could all learn\nTogether isn't that nice well right now folks on the line Bradley birds\nOr or is it works or Bradley Byrne to tell me how to pronounce your name that's really that's really the first place to start\nThat Eric and we can talk about your last name to\nShore my all my relatives say ... but I mean what does your survey but what are what ... what do they know\nBirds or know how do you say how do you say it ... ...\nYeah just surgery will size or\nWell either you make sure I got some times you know you said ... and people go huh no it's burnt shirt and they kind of you could tell that they're offended you know\nI I every year I I if I were in the name Kirsten ... and if you say cure ...\nShe gets offended I got a better vaccine problem it's a real problem the problem okay I don't really know about it really are you really are Bradley jade bird's or of I really am of Hillsdale a college and uh as you know I'm a big fan of Hillsdale you've written a book on Andrew Jackson and the title is\nIn defense of Andrew Jackson now Andrew Jackson is a storied figure and without question a controversial\nFigure many people hate him um many people don't know about him I Am one of the latter I have to say I've heard this I've heard that but I'm not someone who knows very much about him uh I Know he was a so called Indian fighter a he's a hero of the war of Eighteen twelve\nUm but there's something about the time at which he was president that sometimes that's a a ...\nOr in people's learning you know we learn about the revolution we learned about the civil war but there's something about the time of Andrew Jackson maybe we missed it uh so I'm really thrilled that you've written a book on him and you can tell us about um so what do we need to know about him and why is your book titled in defense of Andrew Jackson\nInsured and thank you so much for having me like I remember very well when you came and spoke recommends but it was a real treat so it's great to make that connection and I also appreciate the bigger playing Ringo Starr that was that was licensed\nEntering a star is a big Jacksonian just in\nCase you want to ensure a huge absolutely oh\nThat would be great yeah I'm so let me let me just say that began distance really probably should have been title more accurately inclined\nIn defense of really probably should have been title more accurately and contacts rather than in that sense that there are certain things I think that are indefensible that Andrew Jackson\nAbout one of the reasons I wanted to approach it the way that I did and I I teach the period between the American revolution American civil war Hillsdale every year and it's a it's a blessing to be able to teach that\nOne of the reasons that I went this direction and part of it was a bit mischievous on my part part of it was marketing I've read or he's part but\nI just gotten so tired of how polarized things are and how much ... and has become a symbol really of all evil in early America\nSo I wanted to kind of challenge that and I do think there are things about it I mean you certainly very good for you know blown off by any means I\nHave a very very different kinds of characters and he's very different\nFrom other people have written a new Russell gr or by any means but\nHe was a fascinating figure and I think in so many ways for better and for wars he really was kind of a great\nAmerica at least in great representative of let friends here in America stood for in his own day and age so we're not going to be able to defend his slave holding or some of the things he did that I Would try to do that but I Do think that there\nI think the issues are very complicated from the time and what I found it at least in my own experience Eric going through Jackson's papers\nIn a way that we don't see that often in modern politics you will show on us and just so ... ... ... there's no there's no hiding with Andrew Jackson you know exactly where you stand with him no matter who you are\nWell send us an artist and blunt that's I guess one of the reasons many people have compared Donald Trump to Jackson is isn't that true\nYeah you know there are some similarities I think a bit of course there are differences too I think a lot of the things\nThe bad about Trump ... especially the kinds of whatever's going on in his life outside of his marriage um that kind of stuff is not stopped Jackson would have done it would have put up with is that you show moral bats it's another I think ... point in his favor or how much he revered his wife\nMarriage so Jackson took that seriously what was he did he considered himself a Christian Jackson or when we're with the ... in in that and\nHe's he's Eric it's a great question and he didn't quite a lot about it himself\nBut he narrative very developed whereas the area and and we know that he spent will be the last few years of his life not only as a devout Presbyterian but really spent the last nine years to life doing almost nothing but studying scripture and trying to get ready\nFor the next world and a ... he's a pretty stunning guy and I think if we wanted to think of them in that way the best way would be to say originally you kind of culturally Presbyterian but then he really grows into it as he gets older\nAnd okay so I think for people who know nothing about him and I'm I'm probably one of those sure uh let's I mean I'm I'm always happy to admit my I'm not happy doing my ignorance but I'm willing willing to admit my ignorance is but um if somebody says look I Know nothing about Andrew Jackson and why is he ... a great\nFigure why is he on our twenty dollar bill and why does he belong there who is he\nA tell us who is he and why would he rise to the level of being included you know on one of our most a used bills I mean that's a really prominent position it's not mount Russia right but it's really great Mexican well what is it about him that led\nUp people in the past to think of him that way\nYeah so you're from the lowly he entered on the scene in the Seventeen Ninety publicly as a controversial figure but just to give you a little bit of background Eric\nIt's MORNING Seventeen sixteen Seventeen dies in Eighteen forty five so ... is from the very last president we have who actually fought in the American revolution he was a preteen when he was fighting but he did actually fight as a twelve year old and then as a Thirteen year old or evolution\nBut he's also is the seventh president of the United states needs to be very different type of person for six right he's not permit Virginia we got an Adam's from New England\nYeah this is a guy who's from hardscrabble back frontier country in the Carolinas\nAnd by the Chinese Thirteen not only is he fought in the revolution but he's lost every family member so he's in the world totally on his own with no money nothing and he really doesn't build themselves up and becomes kind of a great person of Nashville, Tennessee\nReally a kind of old Roman patriarch living there on the frontier and well respected but of course as you mentioned his name internationally is made where he defeats the British during the battle at New Orleans in January of Eighteen Fifteen and going forward is reputation just continues until\nHe is elected popularly to the presidency Eighteen twenty four but he's not actually doesn't actually attain the White House until Eighteen twenty eight and then he served two terms so if that's a a summary of the hopefully that's a good summer he just got to think about here's this spring tears when the scotch Irish guy who was kind of\nYour friends your hero almost the legendary get many God of his day like Daniel Boone ... Davy Crockett certainly had that kind of character but very different than the earlier presidents had had\nAll right and so how does he um what what are the things that he did a that would make people hate him or say that we should take him off of a twenty dollar bill\nWell so the two biggest things of course he's not guilty of this alone there were many people who are guilty of this he was a slave holder or he owns a number of slaves obviously slavery from any perspective as a moral and it's an evil\nBut even with in that ... that is he was seen as a good and evil system he was saying there's a link to a slave holder and certainly\nI don't really know I I guess I don't understand sorry to interrupt and say I don't understand how that becomes an issue because obviously all of the people of that era were slave holders so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know like when you think about uh any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and all of them\nAre they were slave holders so I guess I'm thinking they're ... or something about him\nThat goes well beyond simply being a a slave holder in an Arab slave holding\nFlight so I think that gets lumped in generally with envy and ... and the fact that not only it'd be a bit of slate older but you remove all of these Indians for their data ... there's no doubt about\nThe largest demographic explosion history of the world happened quite there American frontier I certainly didn't know that that that's a it's a it's an astounding story\nWell it's interesting to me that you teach this period between the wars so to speak in Hillsdale because it it really is a for me certainly a a a gap in my learning I mean you have little bits and pieces here and there but uh to really think about what's going on in the Eighteen twenties raking thirties I I don't\nI I don't know very much about that time and so it's just fascinating to think of where we were as a country and about this uh X. explosion populations but we're going to be right back folks talking with Hillsdale College professor Bradley birds or the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson [noise]\n\nI mean I Would like to talk of a relief factor sure

College professor Bradley birds or a friendly birds are welcome back it's fascinating to learn about this period in history and it really is\nPainful when you realize sometimes things are just ugly I mean it really is a difficult for us today to defend these actions it seems a callous um but it really is another universe when you think about the world of Eighteen twenty you're Eighteen thirty it's very hard for us\nOr to put ourselves in the shoes of those who lived then because it was obviously a much more brutal world\nSo I I think that's absolutely right Eric and you were saying right before break this was an era that you're not that familiar with I think that's true for most people even American historians to individual at that period you know we're always\nNo matter how liberal or PC the profession might be we still like dating everything by our wars right that there is no major war between the worthy equal to the next war which kind of forget that period\nI Want to get the Mexican war\nYes so we're just jump straight to the civil war and most people would go to war well yeah yeah yeah so it really is but\nOne of the things I Love Eric about it and I would appreciate this as well you know this is it time period it's jak St John Quincy Adams ... still alive Jefferson still alive or so or throw\nA girl and so there are some fascinating people alive at this time right and yeah that that's just to mention whites or you think about some of the Indians like Black Hawk or some of these other guys which is a fascinating time that all kinds of ways\nWell no I can think you know I can think of literary people from that time but as I say when I think of what the world was like first of all\nThe world was you know you you you can hardly think of um what what what would life be like in the frontier compared to what was life like in New York or Boston I mean it's just an amazing time of of growth\nUm so ... what what were the terms of Jackson's presidency or the years so\nHe was so nice elected in Eighteen twenty eight so it takes office was twenty nine and sitting there for two terms so in gun and thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he ... he really it it is interesting because he was even\nEarly on I mean I Know I Can't remember where I ... I read it but that ... even as a as a boy a he had controversy you were saying that he served as a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old in in the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine that a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing\nAnd that that he was captured by the British as as a as a boy that's right ah and and if there was this controversial thing that that he was commanded\nBy a British uh a colonel I guess\nTo clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing many young boy or a colonel I guess\nTo clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing any young boy that's very would refuse to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nYeah uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him with a sword uh enjoy scarring him on his head in his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being\nOr would you become if you experienced that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe is doesn't excuse\nA sum sure he did but it's important for us to understand uh you know what life was like a in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture\nSo it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who is a maze a woman and she died catching a disease helping American sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she taught him from day one as low scotch Irish children taught\nThat violence is the way men solve things and that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people on the Tennessee and Kentucky French years it was just very much a part of it\nWell it's just extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen uh right and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of those yeah his whole life and shake her forgave\nWhat do you do oh somebody over being put on the money [laughter] you know that's a nice little with numerous no but it was really in the Nineteen thirties that the west in boys yeah they do a great he\nWas going to say our energy in your wrote a book about an hour or
