now why you should pull your child from public school before\nIt's too late I'm I've spoken many times on this program program about the um\nThe toxicity of\nYou know the culture in which we live and unfortunate fortunately that's the situation in the public schools so if you as a parent a ... and I as a parent to ... you know we we send their kids off to school what are they learning what the culture of that\nEnvironment it's supposed to be in local per rent is right the whole reason your public school you pay taxes so that they can teach your kids because you can't because you've got a different job right\nAnd they're supposed to be really doing what you want them to do frankly okay you're paying your taxes this is not like some government bureaucracy that gets to tell you when did you ... they're supposed to be doing the job that that you've hired them to do by paying taxes and as we know that's not the way it works so are the two women to whom I Will talk in a moment or

very dramatic dramatically title to get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late I\nHave my self made the case generally speaking that this is how I feel as well but you take an even stronger stand a so let me ask both of you and you can talk as you like uh what is it that led you to this dramatic\nMoments to to not only write a book on the subject but you write a book that takes such a dramatic stand on this issue\nYou know air both of us are in positions where we're talking constantly to parents around the country and we were hearing sort of a lament with parents saying my my child who is now in college or it's a young adult\nThe longer it goes to church or they become so progressive in their their idiot allergy and they're they're leaving behind the values and the belief that we were trying to train in my pin and so\nWe've both been hearing this and we started dating and because there's been a lot of focus on the radicalization that's occurring on college campuses you know telling our kids left for the what we found out\nWas that the data shows this occurred in elementary school and then in high school that that we're losing our kids\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThey both his ear protector show I'm Talking with Mary right past and and Theresa foreign them about their new book titled get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late or and Marion Theresa welcome back thanks so much\nA this is such an important conversations to try to understand how this all happened so you're talking about John do eat a philosopher\nWho had an outsized influence on the American education system and part of what he brought to the equation was this idea of pragmatism as a philosophy in other words we're just going to talk about what is we're not going to talk about what ought to be or what should be or what is better morally we're not going to do that\nRight and we're seeing that Eric even in terms of the departure from science so one of the game changed for us as we looked at this and looked at what parents are facing in the schools is the transgender agenda which has just come in\nAnd is permeating the school culture not to mention in many cases changing the rules in terms of bathrooms in terms of participation athletic teams and\nUse it pronouns and all that sort of thing but what's happening there is that our children are being instructed that what did they learn about the human person that you're born male or female is not true that\nThere is what really matters is weather person identifies as male or female or not binary or something else in these genders or multiplying so that\nIt's a pragmatic view in the sense of paying for what's happening people's feelings are taking them here that must be that's what we do with there's a departure from scientific truth which tells us that every cell in your body is either male or female and the can't change even if you have surgery or take hormones\nBut our children are being taught to disregard that\nAnd to go with someone else's feelings of what's true but\nOur kids are drawn into that you know this kind of magical thinking they had to participate in that\nWell this goes way way way back in other words I remember I'm back or cs Lewis in the abolition of man\nI Believe it was in that book that he ... he begins the book with a discussion of this very thing and so I guess he was writing this in the forties but this had already taken root\nIn England back then that that the children were had a gun to be taught differently and it was more about feelings and less about ... what is actually true which is that that somehow your feelings\nCan Trump the reality so it's like we moods beyond materialism it's it's there's irony here right in other words if you you have\nAnd and I I'm just guessing this traces all the way back to the romantic movement but something happened in the nineteenth century and so this goes way way way back but you're telling me that it's finally too cold in American education with John do\nWell and and Eric I I Would add um I guess the question\nOh and and Eric I I Would add um I guess the question\n\n... sorry\nChasing\nDo have we lost her one of our or people I Will ... will try ... will try to get them back I'm right now is our and me I mean well Mary yeah you can leave\nSo it's a one of the one of the issues here is that um parents and along which onto his philosophy is is this idea that what happens in in the family and is\nSort of separated so parents as we're looking at these radical changes in the public school where where kids are being taught that yes they're born male or female well that doesn't necessarily mean anything it you have to figure out your feelings is that parents are being fenced out\nAnd so I'm really relate a little incidents I a friend of mine was telling me that she was\nUm volunteering at her her public school um during playground Judy her daughter is a kindergartner and her daughter was one of those girls who\nWas a tomboy she just wear T shirts shorts rough and tumble and all this stuff\nAnd yet she knew she was a girl but one of the teachers came over to to this mom and and said well we can see your daughter's exploring her gender we are trying to support that in other words they were pushing her to identify more with the boys\nAs opposed to saying you're a girl who likes to rough and tumble things and and so if that mother had not been standing there she would never have known this this push that her daughter was kidding she she pulled her daughter out\nThere that is I mean that a staggering and I and I want to say you know to my listeners that\nBasically this is a good example of why\nThe thesis of of your book and I know we we we have to read the back the thesis of this book get out now why you should pull your child from public school before it's too late um is apt because when you describe a situation like this my blood boils the teacher\nWould dare would dare to cross that line and to do to impose his or her morality\nOn my child that unacceptable and frankly is a great irony here the separation of church and state dictates that that ought not to happen in other words that write my faith is supposed to be sacrosanct and so when you have the government in the form of a public school teacher stepping in\nAnd imposing his or her\nFaith view or you could say lack of faith you whatever it is it doesn't matter it's a faith view on my child that is actually unconstitutional\nRight but what's happening here is they they um cover themselves by saying first of all this stuff comes in most easily you know the anti bullying program if you're doing an anti playing program you got to teach kids all of that algae beauty cute kids and all the definition gender identity gender expression\nBut but then what happens and this is written into the school regulations excuse me now of many schools where they face civically that because many algae P. T. Q. children are not accepted at home the school needs to be the gatekeeper to protect her\nTo shield that child and not reveal anything that's going on at school if that child is showing some gender confusion not reveal that without the child's permission\nSo this is really being written in with this creating a an assumption really hit parents not only can't decide what's in the best interests of their child but they can't be trusted right and that's a school yeah to be in that right\nI uh you know because we only have an hour let me cut to the chase this is a panic or when I hear that bureaucrats who do not love our children\nAre are presuming to step in to push the parents are who are in many cases half kill themselves to feed these kids and the clothes these kids to take care of these kids to change the diapers to love them\nWhen those people are being pushed out because some bureaucrat has been given the authority\nTo to do that we are\nAt a dramatic impasse and so I Want to underscore the title of your book is get out now I mean I think the problem for a lot of people is how do I get out the public school is free uh where do I go I mean I think this is why so many people push for school vouchers and those kinds of things\nWere Erica one that one of the things that were\nSort of running into that when we have all we we can get that response\nFrom parents what do we do and and I just wanted\nTo return back um I I Want to emphasize that they can you know problem if you're a pastor and you're listening to this broadcast look around in your church they kick in your congregation are blooming aggressively avenge\nAlive or secular and says no one that we see the number of millennials practices phone drop and the numbers with the next generation I don't and I will be if\nIt even a lower and so that the responsibility while I have the parents have a responsibility for my own children\nOf a political who don't have children or who are in position to help Marshall and resources and try to come come together I think a creative solution for everyone if you are involved in a church need to look around and try to find a way to educate your young people\nWell I mean you can have a ... this is the whole thing is that I Know so many people in these people to me that they are heroes\nThey are home schooling their kids it blows my mind that they can do this but then you find people that are home schooling their kids and they don't seem to be as amazing anything how're you doing it and then they tell you well um we have different ways to do it there are other families are in the neighborhood or in the town who do this\nAnd we so the idea that you yourself have to home school your kid there's a whole network\nOr with all kinds of resources so that's that's a very real option I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nRight and that's one thing I mean I Would emphasize here at home schooling today is radically different from what it was before the because of the Internet because of the availability of of collapsed because it's it's just much easier to accomplish it and it's no longer kind of the ... thing that it was maybe Thirty years ago or something\nRight and ... to the political reality is\nLegislators have been doing the minimum as far as things like vouchers go and part of it is because they haven't had to do more they don't want to rock the boat and if they realize that Christian parents who are looking at this ... this is that this is not good for our kids are kids are out of here\nYou can bet that they're going to be responsive and start talking about really letting the money so I Try\nI Want to talk about this when we come back focus your taxes show this is very important conversation stick around for you

D divorce has tried to take this on at the federal level but this is dramatic I mean we do need to give our people options especially when they when this ugly option other than the public schools is a is is the main one\nRight so what's happening with the vouchers as in states that do have voucher programs they typically limit them my income they limit them by number so you might have only three thousand children in a particular area who are allowed to use vouchers they limit them in terms of funds\nAnd that's not at all the same thing and a wide open voucher program that acknowledges that the parents as taxpayers\nAre have already put in the money to educate their children and so they ought to be able to take that money or at least a portion of it even given how much states are spending per child sometimes ten Fifteen thousand dollars per child even if you're gay parents half of that\nAnd allow them to use it to you is tutor supplemental services to afford private schools to home school whatever it might be parents are going to make a far better decision and they'll get the education they want but but we have a lot of um [noise]\nI hate to say this but kinda cowardly legislators who are cowed by the education unions and biology advocacy unions who say you can't disrupt the public schools and my question to them is\nIt are the public school is doing what we want them to do they're they're turning out kids who are politically left who have no faith\nWho are gender confused I wear activists in in the you know sort of left wing sense is that really where most legislators if you put it like that is that really where they think the taxpayers want their money to go we need to create alternative\nWell it really is a it is shocking that legislators I mean I tend not to think of politicians is being courageous people um but in this case\nIt is up to the people which is to see the voters to make them understand you must do this we demand that you do this or this is why we elected you\nRight in there a lot of um uh how how they put an obfuscation here when it comes to the dialogue surrounding this you can't mention ... so that people complaining that you're trying to defund the public schools\nBut actually if you look at um the proposals that are out there they only preserve the operating costs for the school and then they they take the money that the instructional cost per student\nSo that\nThe public schools are not they find that they really don't they don't have the same amount of money\nThey will need to educate those children right any amount of money to get into the parents certainly not a huge chunk that normally allocated per student because every single proposal reserve the operating and so\nThat that's one of one of the problem here is that\nTeam in many cases to be up to the to the to the challenge or we're out of time Mary and Theresa God Bless you and thank you so much for this book\nAnd they hate you for having\nFolks or
