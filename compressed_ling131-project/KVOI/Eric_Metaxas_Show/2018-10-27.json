I think I Do just about every single day I I usually mentioned the alliance defending freedom a and I'm asking folks to uh\nTo help them or help Americans are with\nReligious liberty cases I thought I wouldn't be great to get somebody from the alliance defending freedom who's in the middle of these battles tremendous battles often with the U.S Supreme Court on the issue of religious liberty something that we understood as a nation but have ceased to understand so now we have to have big court cases\nAre and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom I don't know how people like Jack Phillips of the ... masterpiece a cake shop and others uh would defend themselves they wouldn't be able to defend themselves in line to frame of stepping up someone to talk to a\nTo match sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for legislative advocacy Appiah lines defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me well listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as the girls are allowed to use the girls facilities\nAnd so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about with the dangers of\nAdopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the oath cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah that the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness of about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determinations of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child in the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this ... as ... daughter was using the restroom does a young boy that identifies as gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as cautious daughter and so to give a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but as we leave at ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nTo me is saying\n\n\nIn\nThe earth's axis show and we're talking with massive sharp who's a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty\nUm met I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty\nOr in a miracle why do you think it is\nThat what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago he suddenly an issue and alliance defending freedom has to step up and be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage and and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American Well\nI guess the other ... no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these beliefs you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even hold him such if\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight if you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote\nYou better get your friends to vote and you'd better if you can you have to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonized as people of faith\nHas bigoted now again by you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up for everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem\nTo think that biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nA there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are where the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listening carefully 'cause I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here the government can't take sides on issues that touched on the ultimate questions right religion\nIdes on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is a man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now we're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage\nWith regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this passion Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all the might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing a view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty of people who have traditional\nValues so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these head games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nIt's now incumbent on your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people are who are either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even enforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to\nGo local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and other changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you\nIf people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say it all the people listening to me right now if this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy\nOr ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government whatever it is get involved at\nLeast vote folks at least vote because right now in America\nWe're seeing a takeover of of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not the the Democratic Party of Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream\nAre are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where we have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fundraiser for alliance defending freedom or if you want to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks\nUp put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just awful and it's ridiculous and is destroying America so you can go to our website ma taxes talk dot com ma taxes talked outcome if you'd rather call I've got a phone number for you it is eight

I Know that there are people out there thinking oh Eric this fear mongering uh\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know played A People's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just think like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fine and everything is not find if it weren't for you\nAnd the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her and you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girls the results of this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy\nUm but it's taken ... ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're gonna take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just posh and her daughter not just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that and have a physically strong mail whether it's the same age or older\nUh but but attack them or something like that that that shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's a situation we don't know the details but uh it seems that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about teenage kids and it it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have\nUnless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have folks like the alliance defending freedom defending these ideas\nAnd something really disgusting that I Will not mention on this air on the cake so ladies and gentlemen I ask you is somebody demanding that\nA

we're talking with Matt Sharp of the alliance defending freedom now Matt I when I was saying that I I Want to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what jak Philips was asked to do\nWas disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this is this was absolutely foul sexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and we just wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\n... if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in in in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think as a country we need to change our laws what we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak dogs is not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say the folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against\nThis kind of violence this this should have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take that seriously in the ice defending freedom has to defend them I'm having met this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the\nCivil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this\nCommission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying\nWe hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting a civil war when we were fighting the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight a and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't\nDon't do so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know anybody\nThat is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to attacks us talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled please give what you can\nAnd this is that folks this is why God gives us money\nAnd energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because\nThey will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually they're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values you can go see

mom and dad work hard mood is properly upper middle class\nSo work was always part of what the kids are dead [noise]\nMy parents eventually when forced out of high school which was pretty hard [noise] I just think that\nThere's a lot of sacrifice in marriage and I think when we're\nSo involved in ourselves in this world that can pull off apart\nAnd I just think that that kind of happened um\nI don't think that the divorce itself was crushing as just to see them throwing part and it really wasn't any glue\nReally hold it together if I had my mom and\nIn ... there are really holding together now if I had my mom and dad here I Love a bowl and they still get along fine which is it's a very young kids but to see something that you invest in for so much to be\nTaken apart I just don't think they had any rules of engagement in marriage and you know they have that\nTo John and I would go downstairs and we would move the upright freezer that's the thing that nobody can move we've already moved like five albums that week and then they would just go like\nWe're so sorry that we question it's like no that's fine but use them in a good tip [noise]\nThe funny part was we never got called out because we had no extra guys we had no office so it was like you know we're walking a wire without a safety net there but John and I were both leaders\nAnd this industry was very easy to please people would just do back flips if we if we even showed up or they would just be like oh my gosh you guys should such a great job just finishing up just like gotten so we came here to do so and John and I left\nFor college bridges and job never thought of to miniaturize a career for themselves\nOut no never I mean it was like John I this was barren book money in that order and uh we're drinking green bottle of beer as opposed to our other guys drink and like the cheap beer Jana ever drink and really good deal that was like\nThe next move up you know phone kept ringing off the hook for two minute trek at our house my mom come up to keep the higher couple of guys who keep us going and we went out for sure and we came back she bought a new truck and we want with you doing you know we've got payments\nShe bought like a twenty foot truck and John and I would work at school\nBut it really became because it didn't make any money I mean for kids for their money it was fine but my mom London and my mom quit\nHer job at the state of Michigan She had enough I mean just passed up for promotion because she was a woman she went and talked to her boss and he pointed out the guy when he is a family the ... like my mom did my mom was divorced\nShe had enough of that world she took all her qualified retirement money and cashed it all in people were screaming at her own mother and my grandma was just going what are you doing\nThere's a lot of people just says you couldn't do it is this a man's\nWorld the first two years when she quit her job\nShip Paris off anything and just lived off qualified money and rama noodles for two years and if she was sitting here in his room she tell you is the happiest days for life I think she's crazy but she loves building the business she finally made a profit [noise] third year I think\nShe made a thousand dollars and she wasn't sure how to do their taxes because she was like never had a profit\nSo it was the sweetest thing she\nWrote ten checks or a hundred dollars a game to non profits in Lansing\nAnd that got back to the chamber of commerce and some other business people and anyone who is this way\nIt was at that time the Lansing like wrapped his arms around him in a truck and what this is our [noise]\nWhich was a cool [noise] and\nMichigan State university had a bunch of small businesses come in to talk of the business school\nShe went in there [noise] my mom was very shy\nBut God Bless her she got through it this way to turn to you ever consider franchises among those who by moving [noise] she was well I'm a pet I take care of people's pets I franchise so I think if I could use it\nAnd my mom said let's do it\nAnd went through just a wild ride we didn't know what we didn't know about you know trucking regulations franchising rules and\nThe state police showed up at my mom's are about to take her to jail because we were doing you legal move to like what's the legal up moving furniture well there's probably a lot if you're not license [noise]\nBut my mom when she started franchising to mount a truck forty nine years old no college education [noise]\nI was on a northern Michigan is rugby team we were having a party and we needed hotdogs and the party that we're at was kind of like in the student ghetto so there was this random shopping cart on the side of the road and so famous walking by with a couple of her friends and we just want you want to go on a cook out there like [noise] okay\nSo me and my buddy picked up Fran and we put her interested to this now [noise]\nPut her in a shopping cart you started pushing her down the road all the way to the blue and party started to get hot dogs\nI mean the girl fan agreed to be put into shopping cart\nShe did she was cracking up I mean it was all innocent as in the middle of the day and it wasn't that far\nAnd she thought it was kind of funny [noise]\nAnd then I got to know Fran at this party and my roommates are like bring we've got to go we got to go back to health and so they [noise] they drew me in the car like\nCollege guys do\nAnd I own role in the window and I yelled Fran Sheila [noise] I'm going to marry some day

school with my parents wouldn't be perceived as upper middle class a lot of things that she worked hard on I took for granted I went that's really cool [noise]\nAnd then I ended up getting Fran pregnant and I don't mind sharing this I asked her if I could share this she said as long as it helps people don't like running around but yeah I guess [noise]\nBut when we were younger we wouldn't share this but now we share because when she told me she went I'm having this baby back then [noise] if you said I'm going to have an abortion as I find that gr either [noise]\nBut she said you don't
