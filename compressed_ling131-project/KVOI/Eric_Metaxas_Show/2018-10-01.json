come to south\nDakota but it's wonderful to be here um I I Want to talk about a couple of things today of course this Friday we liked to have fun on friday\nWe do so um we we are in our one today by the way we uh we spoke with Bob Woodson mhm when I met up with\nSome uh some months ago I could not believe that I had never met him or knew about this man is a giant he is a big deal a he's an African American who knew charcoal and very well and\nUh he was awarded the Wilbur force award and\nThat step back in I think was February when was that I think it was so right but the point is that it to me to him and they get to know my thought I have to bring him to my radio audience so if you missed out talk dot com\nYou will be blessed I mean he is an amazing amazing man a in a couple of minutes I'm going to be talking to Jeannie Allard a who is with Samaritan women\nJust a great organization will tell you will tell you about that right I don't understand who come in October on two quick\nThings are in the short a time that I have to call in from South Dakota here um basically\nI wanted to mention that I've got copies of my book Donald rains the swamp and Alvin ... I haven't even told you this yet but it is based on a true story\nYeah it's a fable looks like a kids' book but it's based on a true story or there's some people in the story that you will recognize a I don't want to I don't want to tip you off because I Want you to have the joy of recognizing them and do it\nThere's a lot of humor in here there the character of the main character Donald\n... piece followed around by a little blue bird can you guess are the little blue bird sort of sort of a Twitter is at him and um it's not prominent it's just there for you to discover who but it's a little bluebird that that\nTweets and twitters and and some people may understand ah that that's a joke if you don't understand that that's a joke I Can't help you uh uh but uh but the bird follows him around that's and that's number one number to some of the swamp creatures are vaguely familiar okay\nI'm One of them who is read as a communist uh well I'm going to leave that for people to identify who she might be it's very interesting because ah I I\nBoom loaned\nMe\n\nMan\n\nMan of gain\nNamed my taxes show 'em as promise I'm I'm going to focus this hour on something that's extremely important\nUh it's the abolitionist movement of our time I'm about a year ago sometime last year I spoke with gene Allard who heads up an organization called\nThis American women and they deal with this with sex trafficking very important they've got a conference coming up I thought to be a good time to bring her back on the program dean Allard founder and executive director of the American women welcome back\nThank you how much\nAre telling me a a little bit about what your organization is because I'm not assuming that people who hurt us ah some months ago whenever that was will remember\n[noise] sure and there is what we've been doing for the last decade or more which is providing long term store to care for victims of domestic sex trafficking specifically young women who had been victimized here in this country\nAnd helping them re enter society in a productive way and that's been the bulk of our activities and like I said for the last eleven years\nAnd we're moving into new areas at maybe we can talk about\nWell so tell us about the conference coming up it's up to a pretense\nYeah October ... at the Newseum of the Bible we are hosting a symposium of\nA torch bearers across the nation who are invested in the church specifically I'm fully engaging in this issue of eradicating slavery in our country and around the globe and so we've got people who are coming from research\nPolitics academia entertainment\nUm social services etc who are all speaking to how this is an issue that affects all sectors of society and how we all can play a part in bringing about the abolition of modern day slavery\nWell to to somebody who's just tuning in to just dive down the road they turn on the radio and they hear about modern day slavery a lot of people would say what what are you talking about we don't we haven't had slavery in this country since ... masturbation proclamation what do you mean specifically\nYeah and if you look at the technical definition at the ownership of someone I suppose we could say that that\nThat is technically accurate but it really applies as a term for today\nBecause we are talking about people who are so enslaved who are so oppressed and who are literally under the control of others were talking about children are boys girls\nWomen predominantly in this country who are forced into sexual servitude ah for the purposes of other people's profit and pleasure\nWe have labor trafficking in this country so the production of goods and services so that we can get the best dollar and the best price on a particular product and these are not bad labor practices this is not just a willful prostitution listed forced\nCo worst and oftentimes imposed by acts of violence\nAnd threats for these individuals to engage in these acts\nWell again\nI think you know part of what we're dealing with on this vital issue\nIs ignorance I mean in the time of Wilbur force his big role I think was educating a the citizenry of his country and what was going on under their noses they had no idea I mean it's an amazing thing to think that over two hundred years ago\nWell before I was having to tell people what was going on that almost no one knew about\nIn this country when we had a regular chattel slavery most people knew about it uh it was happening right here you could see it\nUm what we're talking about right now is more similar to what was going on and we'll be forced to stay in the sense that your average American simply doesn't see it they say where where where's this happening I don't see this happening uh so what you're saying is that this is all around us\nBut most of us would simply be unable to see it\n[noise] well exactly and that's a great frame of reference because then one of the major dealt says is that in Wilbur forces era when we are talking about transatlantic slavery in you know in America we're talking about people who are no only and identified as slighted right and\nOne of the things that has often said in this movement in that in contrast back in those days you that individuals who literally had chains on their wrists and their necks and on their feet but today we say it's the chain on the brain\nAnd that's more than metaphorically because we deal every day with individuals who are so\nBrainwashed into place of love ploys of fame plays of belong that they are trapped in this state of\nCall it desire but that puts frankly too much agency on it because the capture the the perpetrator is one who is very artful this is a process to get a person to so believe that there are those promises are going to be filled or that a goal\nIs going to be realized and it is a process of grooming in the case of sex trafficking that renders\nAn individual or to the point of servitude doctor Judith Herman a at Harvard puts it I think the best\nShe wrote a great book called common recovery and she says the objective of the Kaptur is to create a willing victim and I think at the W where we get confused because we see on the surface what looks like complicity\nThat yeah that's the thing and and uh and yet a lot of these people are are so vulnerable and so used to being a emotionally bullied a or were threatened with violence that they they go along and and\nSo we would say well it's it's voluntary but really it's it's not is the point it's it's really not voluntary these people that don't don't\nSomebody needs to speak up for them well we\nThe Ninety five to Ninety seven percent of the women that we have served for the last eleven years have\nBeen victims of childhood sexual abuse as young as far as intense frankly but on average between five to seven years old and so if we see her in our program by the time she's Twenty one and this has just been a long trajectory of abuse\nAnd so even calling it ... um PATS be is is inaccurate this is complex trauma because it's layers and layers and layers and one direction or the views that leads towards victimization\nIt's unbelievable I mean\nI ... when when you hear about this kind of thing a as a Christian and the only thing I think about is this is satanic for someone to abuse a child or any human being but a child sexually\nIt's so horrific that I I think part of the issue is that we want to look away because it's so horrifying to do most of us who have children that we ... we can't beret\nUm which is why I'm so grateful for you or a gene a and the rest of you are who are involved in this issue because it's something that\nIt doesn't seem possible in our culture and yet it is happening and we need to do something about I Know there's so many aspects to it I Know at this conference coming up your your\nYou have people you know from government you said from the law firm the academic world Human Services and all these pieces come together so what are some of the things involved\nIn dealing with this I mean I Would say number one what we're talking about is is helping people understand this is happening all around us are so education but what can we do for example legally on this issue\nAwareness is hugely important because uh we we have to have a citizenry that has been formed in order to have good laws\nYou know as a general populace doesn't think that this is happening across the United states we are not going to put into effect and the kind of penalties are the kind of intervention on behalf of law enforcement if you have a state where training law enforcement is not even required it's not going to happen and I think that it\nYou know the adage rings true you're going to find what you're looking for and and the number is also being true or not looking\nIt's still going on and that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist\nSo I think the citizenry being informed is an important first step I think we have to be contacting our legislative officials and a council people at the local level all the way up to the federal level and really make a hue and cry about this and say what is happening this is intolerable in my nation\nAnd to a call them to account\nOn this um so I think that's incredibly important we need much better research on the systemic issues around is the social forces that create an enable this problem I recently did a presentation to\nA a law enforcement conference and I laid out for them the complexities and I will say all of the the loopholes and complications associated with how we define the difference between an adult and a minor\n[noise] it does because we have cases of individuals who are\nMentally challenged who are physically disabled who are economically impoverished and when that slavery exploiting a vulnerability in his age that constitutes vulnerability or do we look at those other factor okay I'll irrespective of age\nHang hang on again forgive me ah folks I'm Talking to gene our founder and executive director of the American women we will be right back\nHave been talking about yesterday I talked to in a second you got to say okay this is important\nIn a lot of people live with pain okay they live at with pain I'm not talking about pain mimic people I'm Talking about people who live

because the kids love it hey we're talking about a really serious subject\nIt is the subject of modern day slavery or sex trafficking I have on the line the founder and executive director of Samaritan women a gene our gene we were just talking about what constitutes\nVulnerability and and I think we can all agree\nThat below a certain line chronologically and others if you're in any way of using a a sixteen year old or a Seventeen year old\nTo make money off of their body that you go to jail because it's like the rape of a child and you can just do it very easily when you say anybody below age Eighteen or something like that but when you go above that line\nHow legally maybe it's not a legal issue how do we do how do we ah help a law enforcement or the the the legal um at the people involved in in in the actual law on this how do we\nDo we help them to see this as slavery and not just as something that's happening between consenting adults\n[noise] well [noise] at the risk of having too simple of any answers the ... of the crimes that should ... should suggest to us\nThat it's not consensual\nMeaning we're talking about in a you know in a car in a hotel room I'm at Fifteen times a day\nWho wouldn't confirm to that with her right mind so I I think that there are some elements of the that the way the crime trends lacks that I'm with law enforcement education they already able to\nDiscern um that somebody over the age of Eighteen is not willfully engaging in this okay so now there's even a dollar a\nYear go ahead\nI'm Sorry go ahead with your question\nWhat was going to say so so it does seem like one way around this is by saying that\nNo matter whether the woman says it's consensual or not we can legally say no it's not we can say this kind of behavior is exploitative no matter what the the person who's exploited thinks minutes is that part of the way we can deal with this\n[noise] so we now we now step into the other macro argument that country doesn't really want to have which is what is our position on prostitution because it's trying to find a way to say well then\nHow can we make enough parameters around trafficking so that prostitution is okay could we say that it's not could we could we say that we don't want to live in a nation where any person cells their body by choice or coercion that that\nThat's not the citizenry that we want to have that's not the nation leave on house right so I think that you can't have one argument without having the other they go hand in glove\nWell right I Would ever ... go ahead\nOftentimes it's that age that changes it because it Seventeen and three sixty four she's traffic\nAnd Eighteen she's a prostitute right that that's I mean\nThis is one of these things where we realize that the law is fundamentally crude you know a ... at the end of the day the law\nIs is is the last resort in in in a way you want a culture that makes this a something that almost never happens and then those rare cases you have to bring the line but unfortunately this happens a lot and so we have to have\nLaws and so it is a terrific to me that we have now is like a quote unquote sex workers industry that is arguing that this is a wonderful thing and it's an empowering for women\nThat obviously is working against those of us who who think that prostitution should not be happening in our culture\n[noise]
