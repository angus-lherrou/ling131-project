good economy and I'm\nA sell off in a good economy is nothing but a bull market correction I I don't mind a bull market correction I worry about is the overall economy starting\nTo himself and I don't see that here but it's going on elsewhere in the world eight five five to nine five sixty six hundred a Janet thank you for wedding welcome you're on the Tom Sullivan Joe\nHi Hi I'm OK you were you wanted to talk about um uh terrorists\nYeah well I mean if you notice them I don't know\nWhy well I uh China why is China hitting record sales to the United states if these terrorists are so bad\nWell I don't know what we just had to like on a solid you just have to raise those twenty five percent yeah being hit deploy an industry has hit\n'em by their so I don't know you know I don't know where you're getting that not that can anybody because I had to do a price increase because of it and we'll do another one anyway\nOne or two things going on either people are saying okay I'll pay more for the product or the company or from China is eating the the tariff so that you don't have to pay more\nOrderly eating the terrorists were were eating part of it absolutely we we just we ate the first ten and then when the fifteenth came out we just couldn't do it\nWhat are you wait a minute or you are you are you this hour or are you the customer\nAnd the seller\nOh you're in that go right there in the flowing business you get these products come in\nDoes your does the wholesale company give you a date eating it doesn't sound like\nWe're eating we ate temperatures than\nYou did and what about ... no no no no no the Chinese company that you buy from\nDo they eat they eat anything\n[noise]\nI couldn't tell you that I I I Know that was supposed to be Fifteen and take our cat entertaining that's what we did and it just seems so whether they ate it or not I I I just couldn't tell you\nSo they raised their price to you that you saw the price okay so they're not eating the debt raging their prices and you are buying their product and you're traveling around in in order to show your product\nTo a customer your eating the extra cost of buying their product at wholesale\nOr eating ten percent Fifteen Percent it's going to be shared with the cuts\nOkay\nAnd if you're hurting your second have you heard any customer say I'm Sorry that's too much I don't know I'm I'm not going to buy it\nIt just you know I've been getting calls when you're raising raising everybody's freaked out about what what it's going to be so I don't I mean we started on the first so you know I'm I don't know if the people that I work in the eating it said\nThat they might eat Fifteen it's just going to depend upon the customers what they think they can do\nAnd also you've got to make a pricey decision do because you've got you got to look around it at that one of your competitors\nDo because you've got you got to look around it at that one of your competitors doing and a Wally made a\n... yeah we eight to ten percent you know so so that was affected this Asian but the Fifteen is just asking to match the F yeah you can't go on but it it it I mean it is right here and I was thinking about it\nAnd going why can't we get some people are getting you know 'cause everybody has this right All right so I just find it funny and whatever\nThat ... that ah the bailout for the farmers that's my job that you know I mean I Know but you know where the ... floor you know where the farmers are\nThat are getting the bail out there in the Midwest and that's where politically they don't want those farmers got to be mad at the Republican so last right above jak what it's about they\nMaybe it will be cost competitive with American Made and then the customer takes a look at one versus the other I don't know how this how long have you with a store to this whole thing of\nThe costs differences the late ... usually it's it's ... working for a dollar a day or that sort of well much of the of the ...\nChina is also not as the cheap labor that they used to be\nThe the Chinese have they figure it out and about labor unions they figured out a lot of different things over in China that the the good old days in China that's why you see a lot of uh made in Vietnam and other places third world countries because China got too expensive\nSell\nWell we'll see how this plan sorted out America yeah I hear you Brian I appreciate the goal is well it's good Steve are you on the show hello Steve how are you\nHave some good afternoon how are you doing\nGood thank you what do you think\nThey don't go out terrorists are directly impacting I'm I'm a I'm a real estate agent and we've seen some pretty dramatic changes over the last ... Ninety Days I'm meaning the most damage tore we've seen in six years\nAn inventory for people that are not in the real estate business means you've got a lot more homes for sale\nHomes for sale correct yeah yeah\nMeaning more competition weren't price reduction um so I just think we're starting to see some beginning signs at least you know in my business\nOf a shift and I connect with a lot of real estate agents across the country and the percentages seemed to be pretty consistent\nAnd a lot of the the bigger markets across the United states\nUh as far as ... well that's going on in New York City there's a ton of places for sale in New York City and prices are coming down so exactly yeah but yeah they're just\nStarting to feel it yet um but you know as as that continues going into that next year you know first quarter in second quarter\nI think a lot of that has to do with new housing starts have been up consistently for the last year and all of that that supplier or new houses and coming to marketing causing um some challenges I think that you know continue its gains of of housing values you're over a year a\nAre starting to slow or and that directly hits Americans pocket book\nWell what about the uh the interest rates because I've got a a story here that mortgage interest rates are fast approaching five percent now do you sound old enough\nSorry you sound older no you don't sound old you're going to sound older you sound old enough to to remember when that five percent was a bargain\nI I mean I write you know I mean if if Romney buddy bought a home in the early eighties it was Thirteen percent but I ... years and years and years seven percent mortgages were kind of normal\nBut uh we've been spoiled for the last decade\nAnd now with him going all all the way up from three up to five people are are they turning their noses up\nDefinitely I think that the biggest change where you've seen really this year as bad people sitting on their hands buyers don't want to get caught at the top of the market sellers are flooding the market because they don't want to get stuck at the top of the market\nUm you know interest rates here locally or are averaging five\nTo five and a quarter and as a direct impact on fires affordability so each time that rate is rain by a quarter percent or ... percent it calls the percentage of available buyers out of the market whether they just\nCan't afford the neighborhoods they want to move into or simply can't qualify for loans anymore\nAnd the average interest rate hovers over the last thirty to fifty years around eight percent if you just look at that number it's still a pretty good deal yeah but in a market like California\nWith the housing prices at or nearing an all time high that five percent becomes you know a lot of money\nAdvertised out over Thirty years sure did too I think that\nEveryone's just on hold that's what I'm feeling I focus more on sellers\nI I just have seen a just a paradigm shift over the last sixty to Ninety Days\nOf everyone just holding tight what about wanting\nAcross all price ranges or or is it affect you won all boys\nRanges yeah all price ranges and you know the high end stop\nKnow we've seen that supply well well more than double\nInterested I I mean I I Would the mortgage rate starting to go up and I think they're going to continue to go up a yeah I think I was thinking about all you in the real estate business I think you're probably going to feel pretty soon see thank you I Do appreciate your point we'll be right\nAbout that matter review of
