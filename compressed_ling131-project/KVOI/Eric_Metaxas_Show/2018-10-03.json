you shouldn't and he encouraged go go to do the same\nAnd so they it just kind of spiral downward a from there um I I really didn't want to talk about this too much on the air because Todd wants to

on when you were there was that around the time that you are on\nShe was okay so that's the last time a pop star kind of act it out and did something really really outrageous they all try but they failed only shunned that O'Connor and by the way people who don't know a genetic ... she's the the lovely a woman with the bald head\nOr who is Irish and very angry and she um she took a picture of the pope this is like what was Ninety One Ninety two is a long time ago\nWhen she took a bunch of hope and tore it because everybody knows that John Paul the second is him meaning he's really mean and so anyway she tore picture the problem is very very controversial at the time and you were on SNL during that time weren't you\nKnow I didn't have any live around here my room and young younger

song I guess the lord must be in New York City I I remember hearing and thinking what that's like where did that come from but he was yeah he's a\nKind of famous once he discovered him hey we're talking about ... first of all I Want to say to my audience again I Apologize if you didn't know or that go go to the gym pet passed on to that great\nApe house in the sky a and they came as a shock to you to learn that that go go was no longer with us I Apologize we should have sent out a statement a hand tied woke us and we're so close I'm that I'm\nA lot of people who knew Todd well who know tied well consider him a friend we were uncomfortable about the relationship with go go and so I think we just didn't want to talk about it you know what I'm saying\nI'm Glad there's now picture of him go go in the yearbook\nWell go go uh ... hey when you're talking about flatulence go go always comes to mind he was a kooky chimp and you know the laughter indelible in the hippocampus as I remember go go\nIs the laughter are just incredible or if that chimp wasn't laughing he was making us laugh\nI'm just an amazing thing but we need to talk about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff and I want to talk to you about SNL because we were talking about the fact that Kanye West this weekend was on Saturday Night live and he did something that the the the most recent\nA memory of anything like it we have to go all the way back to Nineteen Ninety One when Jeanette O'Connor or who some people confuse with a uncle fester from the Addams family because they're both extremely ball proudly bald she performed this this done with a picture of the pope\nAnd Kanye West did something pretty similar he came out with a with a make America great again hat and people just freaked out it was just an amazing thing did you see clips of it\nBecause like I said I went to a Bible study but I ... and there was something about it and leaning up and going to go to YouTube and all that\nWell he um\nBeen pro Trump or at least he hasn't been anti Trump and he he's worn a make a make America great again hat and it's a funny thing because you know we we live in a country where you're supposed to be able to do as you like\n'em but people like Kanye West they do feel bullied they feel that oh because uh I'm black I have to be against the president and he says you can't tell me how to think ah but the people backstage at SNL were were really hard on him and saying you can't go out they're wearing hats\nAnd he said I'm going to go out they're wearing the that had him when he when he went out um he he\nIm going to go out they're wearing the that had him when he when he went out um\nHe he kind of delivered a speech about it and it was just shocking that ah first of all it was shocking that he had the guts to do that that's why I never thought that I Would be tipping might have to come on us but I Am\nI admired just a his bravery in going against the stream you swimming against this dream in that but it was it was just an incredible thing but I wanted to talk more about you how you hate the pope\nWell first I Want to tell you I Am very proud of him to for doing that I read that he also had a shirt on that was a pro\nPicnic shirt right\nSo I think that's interesting because maybe you're thinking statement like we all have the freedom to\nDo have an opinion on you know it's free\nTo a B maybe he's just a marketing genius and he knows how to get attention\nThat's why the neighborhood and that's why she sticks chair\nYeah I guess you're ... you're probably right now what does she she net O'Connor she NATO countered doing these days I don't really I haven't ... if you\nGo if you go to but she and a lot of trouble and mentally and I'm financially\nAnd I'm like what if I don't go on YouTube and she's still in a lot of trouble\n[noise] no I'm just going to watch her interview with Dr phil and it made me really allowed her I I feel like I understand her and I love her and I feel terrible because her mother was so mean to her and you're for ten years here parents can I think it's really hard to rebound from a hard\nChildhoods and you know I actually didn't I didn't know about that so so ... I mean look\nWe're joking around 'cause it's but this was so long ago when she did that uh I mean it's literally Nineteen Ninety Nineteen Ninety Ninety One that she did that on Saturday Night live but now a year you're saying that\nShe\nShe sort of moved on in life and and she's\nShe's having troubles and she\nUm she very dead I saw a recent performance of hers and she's very different towns that\nShit so she I guess she's um ... but you're saying that her mother abused or in some way\nYes her mother very much abused her\n\nSo we pray for her I Love her and didn't know what her back in the spotlight I'm thinking because that's their gas [noise]\nWow I see I didn't I hate when I learned something on my own program I'm supposed\nTo be I think one thing\nIt is yeah I had no idea\nThat's been sounding\nI'm just being emotionally distant but auditory I'm right here\nCan you hear me I can hear you very well yeah\nI got like a pair thing siren Boy Scout and I\nYou know that in Ninety One do you remember the fallout or or was that something that you weren't in ...
