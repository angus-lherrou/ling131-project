about ... well um [noise]\nI I don't think I was thinking about the string theory because my brother told me about that that everything that material is actually vibration wait did you ever hear of this thing\nIt's not the string theory is just called string theory\n[laughter] really yeah [noise] well I\nHeard of that one that like even Black Hawk down and like they're sometimes that we can hear but that that guy here and like when the universe was created got both the universe and to exist and that ... the way and they're still waiting you know\nWell yeah listen this is why you you're very deep because you think about this stuff and this is apt cs Lewis a wrote about this in a in a in his books where he describes heaven or he he talks he mentions is kind of thing and then people who have been to have an income\nBack um they talk about this huh yeah so there's clearly something to it which is why your song the greatest song it's ever been written a is you're onto something really big and it's it's beautiful there's just this is deep stuff\nOh because you know and and the way that makes us down and I wonder if it's all harmonizing some beautiful song God\nWell there's in my mind there's no question that that that's exactly correct I think that that is exactly right and I think that um you know you're you're on to that and the idea that we are the song that the things that's such a beautiful idea even if it weren't true pope politically it seems true but I think that on some level\nThat is true and the word the the word Pima the the the the Greek verb\nWhere we get home from it does mean to make\nA so to speak to make a all of these things are somehow related on some deep level it's almost like the stem cells of the universe or you know our ... it's all related basically when you get right back to the beginning\nYeah I thought that this song was saying that yeah the lesson that I think\nWell what what is what it says that the greatest song as you or something how does it end\nOh that's interesting I thought it meant gee that but I think Jimmy saying\nWell wait a minute what what are the lyrics you wrote it so you have to his own but\nI don't know if you're in ... [laughter]\nDoesn't a song literally at the end of the song said the greatest song as you or something like that but yeah you meant you meant you're singing that back to Jesus yeah so he's the greatest song yeah oh that's interesting oh wow that's interesting\nOh wow so it ... it could be a lesson in the greatest song because we are okay Paul\nWell it all it all depends on whether he is the singer or the song we're both I think that we're getting into some deep we're getting some deep water right now\nWe're\n... we need to bring this back to something shallow like Gary Grant dropping acid or Jamie Farr Merv Griffin or something shallow because this is so deep I don't want to lose anybody okay Dianne can and didn't want you to read scripture at at any of these events because she thought it would push people away\nYeah Franklin going oh what did she call these events she's\nA Bible study the one I went to was on that that was a lot a lot a CBS Radford or something like that but you know I think if you leave the Bible out its danger that\nWay to ... wait a minute wait a minute she's she calls it a Bible study yeah I think no\nNo no she died party\nOr ... oh that that's different if she calls it a God party that God party well I I think she's\nPretty serious about her faith and she's just trying to reach people in a different way I don't think it's as simple as well just look you know and I know some people can share their faith in a way that's off putting and if you try to be sensitive to some people", "show_name": "Eric Metaxas Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "04"}
