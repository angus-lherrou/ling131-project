fall Todd Wilkerson ha hey it's air contacted shall we got to get serious okay we can't be kidding around all the time I have in the studio somebody that I like to call David Limbaugh\nDavid can claim that yes okay\nUh you've written a new book called Jesus is risen Paul in the early church we're talking about it yesterday I Want to continue the conversation\nJust because the doors are locked and you can't get out so this book that you wrote it's effectively a commentary like when somebody says I don't know reading the Bible is confusing you've written a whole bunch of books and this is the latest in that it's like a commentary you're helping to read or go verse by verse\nIn a common sense way in your explaining it when did you get the idea to start doing this for all of the New Testament because I just love it\nIt is so presumptuous when you think about that I that I decided to do that and it's so daunting and I don't mean that facetiously I mean who am I to be doing this uh\nYou know those people who know you are thinking exactly the same [laughter] I think you know what I Know David and it just doesn't make any human sense it's gotta be God that's that's the only explanation but does everybody knows you're not that talented oh not that smart so it has to be guy Dan how are you explain it\nI'm merely a vessel that as as a doctor titles set a pastor I an instrument of God's Grace you know it's it's um\nI don't know because I I I wrote the first Christian book man there's so many people born dollars willing and better at this than I Am and yet it came together in a way that I think it was accessible to people that my buddies couldn't my buddy theologian or pastors could probably not have raised a lot of ...\nAnd then I got the courage to do the next one that the Old Testament the pointing to Christ and I did the gospels and I don't know I really don't know every time I finish a book I I didn't write that somebody else wrote that I couldn't do that in the same thing with this one I got\nIt before I START I can't do this I got a call ... I I I signed a contract but I'm just kidding and but then I get into and I study immerse myself in in ... yes I can do this again and now I'm doing now twenty four seven violating the Sabbath four months to a to rewrite these things\nI don't know I just feel like there's there's something or to studying this and sharing it in a way of people that are on the level that I was I have an enthusiasm that I Want to impart to them or I think I can help set some people on fire and I've I've gotten great feedback on that I'm\nFrom a lot of readers and I don't know I don't it's just kind of my niche I Do think it's pretty bizarre that I'm doing this without having any formal\nTraining although it's not as I listen to you know teasing you I I did the same thing okay and of course you know we'd be an arrogant fools not to have a moment of doubt and humility into say indeed who am I to tell the story about the same time\nA scripture is full of stories where God just tell people to do stuff and they said oh I Can't do it in the end of the fact of the matter is if God has called you to do something you do it in obedience and you trust him with the results in the matter is that you have a gift of communication I find interesting your your brother\nIs it rust red ... rash also as a gift of communication and when you have a gifted communication which I I Am by God's Grace also have you want to use it\nTo help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject people write books on subjects just like this book and it doesn't seem it doesn't speak it it sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it\nThis is easy\nTo live\n... year college access show I'm sitting here with David Limbaugh who continues to write these marvelous books the new one is Jesus is risen Paul in the early church and and David\nMy first question in the segment is what do you need to do this show for your friends with Sean Hannity he has you on the show and the book goes to number one so what what are you why you're wasting your time you should just be writing another book back home where do you live a Cape drawn to Missouri You live in Missouri still I Love it here in Missouri man yes\nSons awesome great friend rush helps me mark within they all help me and I've been blessed you have a unique perspective a unique styled interview and your cerebral you bring up things that nobody else that I don't know is this a pay that\nYeah that was just gonna say I am I'm listening this is pretty good I better shut up\nBut I told I told Lauren that that's not my daughter Laurent with regular I told you that before this yeah this is interviews or a\nMale you know speaking of ... is the publisher of your book regular he's also the publisher of my book\nIs called Donald drain the swamp and I'll tell you something I spent months\nThinking about writing that book and I spent an afternoon writing that book and it is a fable and I think John's going to have me on his program to talk about that you'll see when you read it because it's actually a\nIt is so shallow that anybody can understand that but it's really stupid and it's really fun but ... is the publisher so we share a publisher we share a face yeah uh we were both uh kids in Missouri actually that's not true I was in ... but we're both kids\nAnd here we are in the same room with what are the odds of this it's unbelievable ... Jim credible okay so your book you were just going on to say\nThat the the the figure in this book because it talks about Paul Saint Paul in the early church\nThis takes us really from the gospels into act right yes so suddenly Jesus is crucified he is\nA resurrected from the dead forty days later he is sent to heaven and then everybody standing around thinking okay now what do we do like a he's gone he's resented into having we know we rose from the dead\nWe many of us saw him we talk to him but\nThen we enter what's called the early church and that's what your book talks about is like weird did what happened in those years I'm forty BC fifty bc as Paul and Peter and the other apostles kind of fan out through the early world I'm a ... of that day um\nAnd we were at the point where you said Paul this incredible prosecutor Christians is on a horse on his way to Damascus he's causing a lot of trouble people are scared to death of this guy yeah and he's blinded by the light knocked off of his horse and basically has the ultimate conversion experience\nBy the way you said forty BC\nEighty we've got to make sure the readers\nDon't never correct me and my radio show yeah sorry uh somebody saying that I'm Sorry forty eight the ladies and gentlemen and no dome in the very you know you're the lord okay and so yeah\nYeah so So Paul ... is one of the greatest apologetic a fat or moments or evidence is that\nPaul who is this a persecuted her art in labor of our our ... this labor of Christianity becomes the greatest convert and Christ commissions him to be the apostle to the gym tiles\nAnd the ... means be non Jews and non Jews and yeah it is are they call them in the Bible Greeks can you relate to that you know isn't that interesting is they they limit Greeks you think and and it says but now it says in Christ there's neither you nor Greek yes but only lithuanians [laughter]\nAnd I've spent a lotta manuscripts and look into it and help but isn't that interesting that that\nPaul was appointed specifically\nTo speak to those outside of of the Jewish community now you know it doesn't mean that he didn't speak to people in the Jewish community to convince them that Jesus as messiah but he was specially commission to go to those who were not part of the Jewish community did not go to synagogue and it said to them oh by the way the God\nThat we Jews have worshiped is now available to you through Jesus and God chose the Jewish people to bring a faith in him to the whole world and now the time has come that everybody beyond the world of of the Jews\nKimball leaving the God of the Jews through Jesus he's the bridge and the time is now I mean it's an it's pretty amazing\nPretty amazing and and also amazing and as told in this book which is about the Bible\nThat Paul always retained his heart for the juice for his people and he tries tries to convince them of the authenticity of this message in of Jesus Christ that he is really the messiah and in fact the book of Romans\nIn part as a lament he's suffering so much agony over the idea that he can't convince so many of his Jewish brothers that Christ is the messiah\nOr and and he talks about ultimately Jews coming around by the way I don't want to offend any do I believe that\nThat we believe that Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament and not the abolition of it or not the abolition of the cabinet but the fulfillment of it and at the New Testament is a continuation of the Old Testament completes the picture\nBut I think that Christians authentic Christians have a heart for Jews and we don't we everybody has the same under Christ and you just said there's no great there's no ... it everybody is offered this gift to salvation [noise] uh and\nPaul is you see the agony as he writes or to the early churches who we're deviating from the message\nAnd you see what a raw human being he is and he and he was writing just like it's today because human beings and human nature hasn't changed in two thousand years\nWe're falling people made in God's image which is another paradox and yet fall and Paul rights and pleads with these churches that he found that he feels like they're\nThat he gave birth to them in a literal sense and that his kids are going off the path and he wants to bring 'em back in a disciplinary sense to the true word of God not for his benefit but for theirs and they also will become ambassadors to other Christians and and producers in multiples in that sense throughout the Roman empire and throughout the world in history\nAnd so this is a story these fissile pause writing of these people but the same problems we fear experience today\nThey're they're they've got falls teachers coming in their ... puffed up on their own false stories trying to build their own legal or maybe maybe demonic Lee inspired to get people off the gospel\nBut and they're they're in disarming in their churches there they're making a mockery of the lord supper and fighting and he's telling given a practical advice practical mundane advice how they get back\nTo the spiritual practices and then he's also in getting very lofty as to Christian doctrine and he this is preserved these weren't scripture when he wrote them and they were but nobody knew and preserve their letters to individual churches are individuals\nAnd now they are preserved by God's Providence to become letters for all Christians so that we can be\nFBI isn't is amazing I mean I I always want to say because I Know there's somebody out there listening who doesn't\nKnow when Christians talk about the book of Romans or the ... whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul uh is traveling around the ancient world creating churches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here and here\nAnd hearing here but then it keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he's not just like oh let me just down if you know these thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains\nTo school them in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you just had this practical stuff that he hears about arguments about communion or this or that\nAnd he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing and in another parallel thing\nIt's grounded in actual history just like\nThe entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as badly resurrection so here's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit a empowerment he's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice and doctrine\nNot knowing that they're only going to be available to us right in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was literally that's what's so cool is that when you say in a transcending way when he was writing them as you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that he just thought I'm just writing\nTo the specific group of people either in Rome or in colossus or in a delay show or one of these places he's writing to them but the way he wrote God used it to reach Christians for ever and ever and ever it becomes the word of God\nIn and they but they have this idea that that those of us who believe this really are a bunch of village idiots who who haven't even considered that the the uh\nReasons not to believe in that we didn't have the same doubts ourselves we of course we had the same doubts herself but now you were convinced anyway\nThat see that's the thing I mean I I Know that you and I we had ... we have so much doubt that we didn't believe it yeah and then\nSomething happened folks are we're going to be right back talking to David Lynch bought the book is Jesus is

that's gonna it's gonna outlast you I mean you're putting in the pages of these books stuff that people can read any time help them understand what the Bible says you I mean you've just got to be probably really accomplishing something for the ages\nYou know this was the proud of his name is your microphone on is this is my phone on okay guys yeah he\nProbably are not supposed to be proud of these things but I I Am I I feel really good about that that I I've gotten the feedback from a lot of people that they these books do help people understand scripture better and make them want to get into scripture better and and as you say that they do they will survive\nOr to some extent I don't have any idea and and again I don't take personal credit for whatever it is and this is a false humility we all know\nChristians that this has to be from the Holy Spirit if it has any lasting value that's a positive value and yeah I'm humbled by it I I Love it it's just an exciting thing is exciting period in my personal or professional development that's more gratifying than anything I've ever done\nAnd what happens after this book did you say you're going to go into the other uh pistols or in in the scripture\nYes I Would have finished the ... the New Testament after the gospels with this book\nBut space limitations which must be a demonic thing yeah [laughter] that's it I just I let the content speak for itself it dictates the amount of space I'm going to cover I don't try to artificially reduce it to try to make it accessible but deep enough\nTo to impart what I Want and it just lend itself to these six books\nA pause missionary pistols once he wrote on his three missionary journeys and on his trip to Rome now he's got seven I've got seven officials left to cover on excited to cover does and the rest of the episode that the other apostles wrote I don't think I'm going to have the audacity to tackle the book of revelation well maybe we could do that together\n'cause we're we're we've got to get knocked out on the weekend or no seriously that's a that's a pretty big but well I mean look part of the reason that you didn't want to do it all in one book is because once it goes beyond three hundred pages people get weird yeah and I think that reg Murray probably smartly said hey\nAh please keep it to to the kind of a size of a book where people actually pick it up and buy it and read it and stuff and\nAnd again you're very accessible and so sometimes I think are book fools people into thinking it's going to be very\nUs skull scholarly a yeah times my bigger books have done that people kind of scared and a half and the fact of the matter is no that's uh that's just an appearance but\nUm I I just think the idea that you're basically

when he was barely forty years old a dynamic guy and he was at peace and he started asking me what my family in\nFinance or don't Tom you've changed since I saw you four years ago he said yes I have a job\nAnd then he looked up at the clock and he didn't look nice right now but he said oh has accepted Jesus Christ and committed by life too\nI got to tell you are going to people I took it for a river bottom I'd sure I'd never heard anyone talk like that I grew up in that vast Unitarian wasteland of New England I never heard that gospel I never heard anybody talking about Christ as a as a person\nLike on the Sunday school and learn the lessons you learned in Sunday school but it didn't mean anything today\nHe looked away as I found out because he never done this with anyone before it\nI thought about that for the next three months\nI couldn't get a lot of my mind that so I went back to the money isn't an artist and Nineteen Seventy three and I was a time you got to explain this to me\nAnd he said before I Do I Want to rejoin chapter from a book chapter I'd recommend for all of you particularly because you're Taipei high achievers you wouldn't be a Columbia rather was\nAnd I am a he read to me the chapter from cs Lewis says Mira Christianity entitled the great vice a great sense ...\nProbably not as always looking to life looking down on other people and things and therefore can't see something above themselves or the measurably suburbia God\nI'd listen to this chapter and she goes to listen to you know I'm the Oxford dean who was a great question of power just as well as a great professor of medieval literature\nI listen to that and I realized he was running around me\nI thought I'd done all these good things because I Want to\nServe my country and I wanted to be a success that my profession and\nIt was really all about me\nAnd I was up there that night in pain listening to that chapter\nAnd I'm Tom told me how we'd gone forward in a coup saying here in New York with Billy Graham preaching and given his wife to Christ\nAnd I was really move he wanted to pray with me and I said no I I remember a parade acts up in a church so he probably but that might eat\nHe told me of his own experience when he gave us like to Christ and here I was the tough guy and\nI don't think I'd ever cried or I'd love to know if I did I left his home at night\nI look back and I got into the automobile and I tried to drive away or I could not\nBecause the tough guy was crying too hard I couldn't see the road in the front of me and I pulled over and sat there I have no idea for how long\nWe used to now maybe longer thinking about my life thinking about could there be a God than it is if the work that I Know him\nAnd I just called out to them I didn't know any of the words I'd never seen any brochures about other job closed him I never knew there was such a thing about organized Christianity except I once in awhile to drive to church as a kid\nBut that night for the first time in my life I was sure and that was a cat\nAnd I was sure he was hearing me\nI woke up the next morning figure and I was going to be embarrassed and they're still I couldn't wait to get my hands on murder Christianity and read it from cover to cover\nAnd I can only tell you that voted for me to forty two years without God and same chapter and that's why almost wasn't going to be able to speak after that I had not heard that clip before I mean if you are struggling with pride pick up near Christianity\nIt'll wacky over the side of the ...\nSo you're taking that first step and is

prisoner in the state of Washington more than it was about to her up in a riot because\nThe inmates were rioting over the fact that I'm often that sells for nine months\nBecause ten guards had been murdered or twelve month period it was the most brutal place I've been in my life\nAnd I came into a room just watch like this one in a prison\nAbout the same number of people you hundred scattered around the room\nNo guards came that one guard you know they took his jacket off so it wasn't on ...\nAnd I talk to these guys about what had happened to me in person I talked about what caused could
