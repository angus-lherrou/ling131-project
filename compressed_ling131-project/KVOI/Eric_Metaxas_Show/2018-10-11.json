my friend well this is called why we fight defeating America's enemies with no parties you have\nUm carved out a place for yourself you you are real fighter and I and I think we talked about this on the radio program because my parents grew up under communism in Europe your parents did you know what it is\nYou do not buy into the mushy American Lawyer who are we to judge you know evil when you see it and you know that you must fight evil and that's what this book is about as far as I can tell but I Want hearing your words when you say why we fight feed America's enemies with no apologies who for example who are America's enemies when you say that what do you mean well\nThe book is a combination of two things number one it's a strategic analysis of all the threats are external so I go through every body ... hobbies China Russia you name it what what they wish to achieve how they wish to destroy us and what it's going to take the Donald Trump from a tree for intelligence services to negate that threat\nBut the second pop 'em they're off for vignettes in the store is so dry national security I talk about American heroes and the four great American heroes that I write about a number one is the first\nThe man who led off first counter terrorism right against gee how these two hundred years ago\nStephen Decatur the youngest captain the U.S navy ever today and this was under ... percent yes this was on his that Jefferson had enough of our ships I'll say this is being taken hostage by the hobbies of North Africa the Barbary pirates\nSo he deployed this man and he took a covert mission of twenty Marines to recapture the USS Philadelphia that had been taken by the ... the Barbary pirates of as as a boutique\nThat that we are so powerful and he\nThe fact that we don't know there's the ... and this is why like I'm so thrilled you wrote this book because\nIt's part of my mission in life is to to find these things that not that we should know we must know every American should know this story this is our history and you are putting it on the printed page so now a generation Americans can discover this because I did not know that part of the story\nYes so Stephen Decatur is the first one that I Want to reintroduce to America that I go through the Korean War and amazing marine cool a legit uncle chess the polar who turned around that he was a real war hero than turned her out of the war in the Pacific on ... almost singlehandedly\nA legend in the marine corps when they ... they shot the cadences today that they took the shot about due on for just the people that do twenty protesting so this is a guy who is you know we need to know about him\nThan I talk about the Vietnam War veteran who most people probably have heard of\nA naval aviator captured\nYou have to read this chapter this is what this will speak to you directly or a man of faith captured a in Vietnam spent six and a half years in the handle Hilton\nNever lost his faith in

people I think who under the age of thirty ... sadly and that's where the ...\nAnd my my argument is the following you don't need to wear a uniform and carry a gun to be a hero where they could do that but the man if he is he a here he is important I didn't have no idea what was going to happen in the last month\nBut Whitaker chambers was the man who was capital before Kavanaugh was born right we we are some people are shocked at what the Democrats did to this garbage man yet off this Kevin ... and I want to tell them\nThey did it Seventy years ago they did it not just to Clarence Thomas they did it too wicked chambers in the first televised congressional testimony a man stood up for the truth\nThis is the man who had been a communist and said I Know who the agents are inside the U.S government working for Moscow because I was in Korea and I'll tell you who they are one of his ... his a darling of the Democrats a dollar his\nJob is it not amazing that this I mean ... you're exactly right in that if you're old enough and we're old enough to all your memory of history that the or if you read history you just see that there is nothing new under the sun I remember the same kind of\nFlavor of bitterness um when Reagan was president I remember being in Europe you know with my backpack and and and and left wing or Brits saying something about Ronny Reagan and it was the same\nFeeling of hatred about American greatness and really of course it's a misunderstanding but it turns into this hatred and you you do all the way back to Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers and it goes before that I mean luckily in his book of course would occur chambers what's his hero inhaler and but ... has gotten many yeah which is written about the ... of the late\nForties yes in the late forties identifies all of these things were already deeply entrenched in academia in places like Yale and so this is just more of the same it's the same uh evil enemy\nThink about what does this for a moment those who think that that that will happen to Kevin ... is is new and shocking Whittaker Chambers who stood up for the truth a man of faith what did they do to him when he said ... is a communist and there's an agent of Moscow they accused is a man of being a homosexual\nA drunk an alcoholic they accused him of killing or being responsible for the death of his brother none of it none of it or the Tiller was true and you never gave up and he wrote that incredible book witness so ... ... capital guys it's not the first time and it won't be the loss right\nIt's it's a real battle and I think that the reason I get so excited about your book and about your personality is that that the title the why\nSo excited about your book and about your personality is that that the title of the book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies by the way that I I'm pretty sure this is going to go to number one because this is it's the book we need you haven't come out with a book so many people love you but the attitude of understanding that we must\nFight that you cannot have all of the blessings we have in this great country unless you're willing to defend it and you're not willing to defend it unless you appreciate what it is and there's so many Americans who actually think oh this is just something that it's no big deal it's not that\nYou think you know this is so rare in history to have these kinds of freedoms and this kind of wealth and entire nation where everybody can have a TV and on and on and on this is absolutely historically a a blip most places in the

is a blessing if you take it for granted it will go away\nWhy why do do a founding documents think of the declaration of independence why did the founders use language such as we will pledge walk we will pledge a treasure our lives in ... for the last part of that sentence or a sacred or on the\nCan you imagine that they're using words like honor who talks around honor today it doesn't exist in

Bush would've said right or whatever but you realize that none of those more establishment figures had the craziness the chutzpah\nTo go as far as Trump goes to be willing to say the things that everyone says you can't say that it's like it's kind of like\nWhen Reagan said Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall the state department said what ever you do you must not say that removed it from his speech seven times and okay I've arrived and so it's a kind of a prophetic\nThis is the antithesis of honor this is the antithesis of dignity this is what they have embraced folks I'm Talking

was just extremely miserable and um when you are in that situation you had\nYou don't know how to save for yourself you don't know how to make choices that I I didn't know how to go to the grocery store I didn't know how to really do anything at all on my own um that's another thing that they do to keep you under their control because you know it's a it's a constant here\nAnd there was a constant fear as\nMe that I Am this horrible person there's a constant fear that you know I'm going to do something wrong because every single thing that I did was to always remember what I said or did it was always wrong and I either got\nUm some form of kids who punishment sexual punishment or um [noise]\nThere's just tons of things that\nThey used to control me\nWhen I was in my twenties I began to\nAn eating disorder and\nEvery single little thing is controlled so\nYou know have a lot of a lot of issues a lot of\nDepression and\nAm it's very obvious on\nMe so I was in it in a situation where\nIt just worked out to where they [noise]\nThey took steps to try to help me you know\nIt took quite some time\nI was finally able to open\nLittle at a time about what was going on with me and I'm\nAs I began to do that they began to take steps to give me a place to live\nAnd they gave me a car to drive it helped me find jobs\nYou know just a safe place to this day now\nIt's hard to understand um\nWhen every single\nMovie that you might think has been controlled it down to who you speak to normally\nIf I ever spoke to anybody that they didn't want me to speak to that wasn't involved in all the things that they were doing they would tell me\nWell you know that we're going to sell you didn't then\nSo they are involved as well and so I just\nEverybody you know that's just what people visit me and I didn't I didn't know there was anything different so\nThey began to make these steps to show me love and show me kindness and it just started breaking down walls that\nCould never have done I'm ...\nAnd I'm sad began to to learn how to trust them like I\nYou know night after night with things okay well when is going to be the day that they're going to\nLike that of all the other people like when when are they going to change 'em because I was continually told that\nYou know they would be just the same um\nBut over time\nHaving them less me like my ... a real family having them\nCare for me like a real family not expecting anything because I'm\nAs someone who is just like somebody that's being trafficked everything you do\nEverything you get in everything that even your basic needs are because you've done something to earn and it's not in not seen as for free and so as I began to do things for me and love me and show me\nHis kindness and to break down the walls\nAnd I know it's very hard and difficult for people to understand but I'm Still waiting in traffic during that time because I just\nI had been settled trying to think that that's all that I deserved\nSince I began to just show me my value and show me that\nYou know I deserve better and and you know it was just waiting and waiting for something\nAnd it just never dead and so\nAmount of time you know there's always threats there's always um\nThe kids are losing\nTheir lives and money they're losing\nControl so there was a lot of threats a lot of threats for those people a lot of starts to me\nIn for me I I could deal with\nThe threats for myself you know I\nHad such low self esteem and was OK with being her\nThose consequences for myself but\nNot towards these people so because of\nThat fear I continue to the traffic is I I was so terrorize\nThinking that they you know they would do something to the states\nAnd you know I think it just took time God was striking down laws and helping me to say that I could be free\nYou know I I just\nI Can't say that any other way and then gave me the strength to to step out and I\nI had some money saved and I uh\nYou know just left and\nDidn't tell anybody you know make sure they knew you know that\nThey knew that I was gonna be okay the people that were helping me they knew I was going to be okay and I was taking care of\nBut I I I Want to protect them and I left you know pretty much packed up everything and left without telling anybody exactly where I was going and I'm\nPretty much for a whole year\nWas so Tara afraid you know they were going to find me I didn't really speak to anybody until a\nAbout a year later and you know I\nI guess it took that long for me to really believe that I can be free\nAnd believe that\nGod let me enough that I can\nI could really say that I was\nWasn't a controlled I wasn't as five any longer and so it was a long long journey but I'm extremely grateful for every\nLittle detail that ... to\nTo wrestling you made a deal when was it the hope realized she was asleep and the victim of sex trafficking [noise]\nWell I\nThink that are really\nRealized until I met this couple and I began\nI began to see how they treated their children\nAnd I began to see how their children with their lives\nAnd\nAnd it didn't change like ... it wasn't like in front of people they were one way and then when they came home\nThey were a different way or if they were church several one way and I left and I wrote a different way it was consistent all the time this is consistent against\nThe people that didn't\nYou know traffic to me they were hideous and in in in in tortured me I mean they [noise]\nIt is hard to even say the things that they did [noise]\nBut then when they were in\nPublic at church or at school\nOut you know whatever they were doing they were completely\nDifferent and um and so I was the one that was taking all the time and her and all that so
