I always know\nWho is getting the award who's just bought bought some guy and when I heard your story I just flipped I said this is nuts and in part I think of the best thing about you're getting that award is that\nIt made me realize who you are so I could have you on this program so that all of my listeners not just the people in that room at the closest but could get to know you and the work that you're doing a\nAt the at the woods and center it it is Mitch magnificent to me now that night I'm part of what made it interesting is you had a number of these men whose lives that you have seen transformed so to review for people who are just tuning into this program ... you're in the business of a a a retail\nYou you you are working with people you've created the woods in center to to work with people that are struggling with drugs addictions are all kinds of stuff and you get them to turn their lives around and you have decades um ... in this in this world\nAnd as we talked I was saying that it must be discouraging because you're fighting an establishment that you have seen from over fifty years ago\nThat that that the what the civil rights movement morphed into a kind of a grievance a thing it's just not something you saw from the beginning that it was not going to work and you dedicated your life to something else and I thought it must be so hard but you said it's because of these men\nThat puts a smile on your face that you keep going\nYes Mother Teresa or when she was walking Bombay was senator Packwood the time and he said to her\nMother Teresa you must be frustrated that you are more successful after all you can only help three hundred people at your hospital and their three million who need help she said God God does not require success of me just say to them as\nIt is for him to determine when and if success is to occur and that move me to to just continue yeah and when I reached out to those young men and I saw how some of them I could ... when I first met them\nThey were just looking evil and I said to myself there's no way this guy's going to ever change them saying to myself\nAnd then within two weeks I began to teach something awaken in him and then next thing you knew he took his same leadership for for evil to turn it into good and he became suddenly this Joseph is inspiring\nAnd then he went on to a inspire others um and and so I I was just moved in and out and and so we look for in other words\nThe principles of the market economy applying the social economy in a market economy only three percent of the people are entrepreneurs but they generate Seventy percent of the jobs so we're looking for ways of solving problems in the social economy\nMost of the innovation of curves among a very small number of people like the Derek Ross's than others but because of their witness and their influence they can begin to take a what they have done and influenced the majority of people\nThis is a is this the trickle down theory and it works I mean it's it's really amazing to me because you have these leaders ah ... they have an outsized effect somehow that people look at them and it just has an amazing effect so it's like a trickle down of wealth but it's cultural well\nIt really does see and that and that violence reduction we we we we've refined those principles and we have an operating for Fifteen Years in Milwaukee school system I just got an invitation from the chief of police of the city and the head of city council\nIn Indianapolis, Indiana to bring our violence free zone program to one of the most dangerous ZIP codes in that city we're going to be working through Pashtu Webster Emanuel missionary Baptist church\nPastor Webster has a very unique ministry where he has had hundreds of men when they called a boot camp as his church\nThe hundred and fifty men most of them ex offenders come twenty straight days from five thirty in the morning to seven no breakfast so you have to be intentional about wanting to change the past two Webster has done a tremendous job of helping to transform and redeem people we're going to take this\nThis ah um I took a gym daily there and he did a A N of folks on the on the family\nSo we're going to this is a rich resource that exist within that community and I'm going to take our skill and talent and training\nAnd take that and apply it to that dangerous ZIP Code and so we're going to demonstrate that we can reduce violence than almost any community by twenty five percent in three months\nOK so obvious question Chicago or I mean are they not desperate enough to reach out to\n... I have made three trips to Chicago's talked to various groups offered to bring our approach there but there's the the the resistance to this is that\nPeople feel that they didn't invent it [noise] it doesn't exist and if we have spent three to\nFour million dollars at the University of Chicago school of criminal justice and their interventions having worked if we put millions more and then how can you\nUh work so what we're fighting again ... is a tradition of failure that has become ingrained in institutions that resist anything new but fortunately we have some cities like Indianapolis and others and Eric I Hope to be able to demonstrate\nThe effectiveness of it in some place and we can get the kind of public attention to those successes right and maybe we can change it\nWell I mean it it it's extraordinary you you know there's a situation in Chicago\nIt seems beyond belief at this point and I guess I kind of wonder I Wish I could uh read the mind of the current mayor of Chicago to wonder what is he thinking what where does he think you'd go just to just go away maybe just goes away a\nBut it is so bad there and you're telling me\nThat you have the solution you've done this for decades this is not kind of okay here's a crazy idea it it has worked over and over and you've seen it work over and over you can talk about it intelligently this is not just some crazy idea that happens to work you know why it works you can just cry and you do describe how and why it works\nUm do you depend I see that with the Senate dot org means that you're a non profit so yeah so you depend on donations yes contributions contributions ... I I really hope a Bob that there's somebody listening right now\nThat understands that are you guys you're proving it I mean when somebody ... you know you you you are investing stuff that you know a ... it's not a joke it's not a crazy idea at each working and this is something that's working it's very simple it's not very complicated right you're right when it is working but let me let me\nJust walk you through how it works yeah ah because we took those principles that transformed those young men and we'd be find it and to operating principles and others have you have a school like I started in Milwaukee Fifteen Years ago one school the Bradley Foundation gave us a grant\nTo go into one school if you have a group of ... or let's say a thousand students are controlled\nBy ten percent and that ten percent ten percent\nSo if you so if you get youth we put about eight years to ... and young adults from the community many of them have dropped out of those same schools they have been transformed and they are moral mattress in character coaches so they they speak two weeks to identify who the shots call this the people\nWho is this is really funny this is a movie by you understand somebody needs to make a movie about this 'cause this is real\nAnd so what happens if you're a dentist by that ten percent of a cohort and then you reach out to them and and you\nGive them a respectful way to be peaceful\nAnd uh and then they influence the other uh a Ninety percent and that's\nWhy we're able to go into a school most dangerous schools we only went into one and the principal said uh I'm not getting reports from teachers or something we what do we call it climate survey we as teachers just\nDo you feel safer and the principal and the superintendent said hey the police are not getting calls to the school every so we did this one school\nHow many lives were changed how many many lives were changed and ... that kind of attitude which is exemplified by you we just we don't\nSeem very much of it although I have to say I I Am a little bit encouraged not just by you very much by you but but I'm encouraged by some other voices that are out there right now I think that it's possible that this has been done a to change uh it it is changing\nA in certain parts of the African American community we're going to be right back folks I'm Talking about what's in\nPlease go to Woodson\nCenter dot org you need to know more about what the ... center is doing with the center dot org and my website of course my taxes stock dot com we'll be right back\nHey I'll Ben hey can I tell you about really fat or at least to please no no I'm asking you can I owe you may you mean I I I may you know for me but I tell you what we've got somebody else who's going to talk about really factor let's hear from her first her name is sue here it is\nI suffer with pain all up and down the law for Thirty years or pedals for more clout I was desperate and I all to find something that would help them home when I heard about the quick star program or order and a ... or help our own free\nOkay that sue right now I was just with my relatives down in Atlanta for a wedding and I was basically saying the same thing to them why I said look I advertise this thing on my program is called relief factor okay and some of them they've got ...

just it's such a joy to have you here I already want to have you back\nAnd we're not even done with this interview or you you said you wanted to talk about solutions I'm happy you said that because we need to hear what are some of the solutions the woods the center and you you are\nPutting forth the solutions day by day most of it unheralded the news doesn't you know that's one of the reason I Want to have you on people need to know what's happening but tell us what are some of the solutions for first of all are\nYou brought up when you approach the problem of poverty and people say well Seventy percent of people living in particularly in the black community ah living in communities where the kids are dropping out of school and gone to jail\nAnd I say ... suddenly a thirty percent or not [laughter]\nThe question is what is happening among those who are raising children in poverty but not of poverty\nThey're raising children successful they are the real experts so I said two scholars I say the others go into a community not on the assumption that what you what you need to offer his charity but before you offered to do anything to find out who's already doing things\nThat is really brilliant I have to hand it to you because it's something that you seem to have a particular knack for seeing this kind of thing but that's it it strikes me as counterintuitive but then you say it and I think wow now may I mean anybody would say that makes perfect sense and so you you are but you have done that very thing\nThat we call them the Woodson principles that's what the staff called and the principal is is that to solve the problem of poverty that people shouldn't have to surrender the dignity to get help\nThat the foundation of any health relationship is pretty pro quo I give something you and you get something to me\nAnd so we are to not do do food pantries and just hand things out to people\nWe must let them or in a matter of fact you uh uh I I talked about this that the acting Institute in the piece I did\nI for example or are they had a a a a a woman's shelter abuse shelter where moms were there and each year volunteers would collect toys and give them out to the kids everybody was happy but the moms\nWell executive director the second year allow the moms to burn toy vouchers by sewing by babysitting by performing certain chores that they would then or in a voucher and the toys that were collected workplace in a store\nSo the moms could shop for their own children are so this is the fundamental principle that we should follow when we're trying to help the poor\nAssume that they desire to they've got the ability to and the agency to help themselves that you should never do more for people than they are willing to do for themselves wow\nThat's I mean again that's perfect common sense but the concept of dignity\nOr it seems to have gone out of the culture it's not part of the vocabulary of this culture dignity now I Know that when I think of civil rights heroes like Rosa Parks Dr King Jackie Robinson there was tremendous dignity it seemed to be the main thing you notice with these people dignity\nThat's just not a word that you hear\nNo but all of our grassroots leaders that's what\nWhat was really has help restore them is they their embrace of the ... the fundamental virtues and principles of our founders\nFelt self determination we look for agency we look for an opportunity to help\nAnd so we go in with the expectation that you have the answers to your own problems and therefore we will give you help we will give you access to money we will give you access to training\nBut the solutions have to come from you I'm not going to come and paint show walls\nYou pay your own ball [laughter] that's I mean it it it's wise is funny it's funny to me because it's a it's delightful to hear you say these things 'cause it's it's obviously true and anybody but a fool recognizes this I mean this is basic human stuff unless you really\nHave a view of people that are deeply patronizing\nYou recognize that that people want dignity people want to be able to work people want to be able to earn something but it's as if it's not as if a ...

taking care of that she can fight with nobody all\nRight so it's you have to do a good job and know that you know I'm not in control of if I live longer than her or not\nI mean I could I could worry about that I suppose but I'm not in control of that so [noise] um [noise]\nHave to make sure that if I'm not here I'm not able to be here that I've got other things in place to make sure that she's going to be taken care of\nAnd I have no doubt I there there are people around this community that would adopt her tomorrow if if they had they not I don't think they fully understand what that means\nAnd I'm not going to talk I'm Out of it but [noise]\nYou know I have no doubt that she will be taking care of it is you know we have colleagues weren't here tomorrow [noise]\nShe would be fine and the rest of my kids would be fun and I think that's all you can\nDo but I don't think that's any different than any normal paranoia sure\nIn the end [noise] she's a normal kid [noise]\nBut she is different in so many good way [noise]\nI Wish that I had her attitude I mean she will come up you shake your hand she'll tell you she loves her shirt\nAsk your name I mean she is literally the most personable person I have ever met [noise]\nShe's unreal she you've heard the phrase that you know I don't know what it is she's got is you'll see he's the walking it [noise]\nThey all three of Alex\nFills you up with broad as a parent you'd love for I'd love to be that way I'd love for all my kids to be that way [noise]\nUh I was just shocked kid in high school that never wanted to talk to people even if I knew your real well the windows open up that much a lot of people thought you know I just got stuck up or a snob and I was just shocked I literally just didn't want to talk to people [noise]\n'cause I didn't know what to say I was always going to call them the wrong name them horrible with names [noise]\nIn having her [noise]\nAubrey has opened up my personality because I don't have any option\nIf she's there she's talking to everyone so then I have to interact\nAll the time so me today versus me Thirteen Years ago\nA complete different personal I mean I as far as personal talking to people going up and meeting people you know\nI'm a lot more apt to do that now part of that because I'm older and I'm growing up and I\nWorked in business and you learn these things but part of it is because I didn't have an option [noise]\nShe's supposed to be a different one way or the were absolutely I mean there is there are things about her personality that if I could just [noise]\nTake an implant in myself I Would do it tomorrow\nYou know we've met so many people we never would have met if we didn't have her we'd have relationships with people that we never would have had were not for\nThe daily owns came to mind their family that we met basically through our\nOur baby sitters last man he\nOr she worked for all the time she was actually a student teacher at the school that we went to in Jackson [noise] and then she started coming over to the house after school\nShe started come over to the house after school and keeping the girls are a little bit and then she keep 'em whenever we'd go to in a band or something like that pushing the coming over a lot like even when we didn't necessarily need a meter we wanted to kind of keep her busy and keep her because she was so good with the girl she just\nShe came from a really good family they really had a heart for it you know taking care of special needs and being [noise] you know\nMindful of that she was in college a bell haven\nShe played soccer ... when she and her free time to come help us and so her parents come to town to watch her play soccer\nAnd they want to meet us was the first thing that want to do 'cause all they've done is heard about all every\nThey're just fantastic people as well and they you know now they come to town they're coming they actually are going to come up here and they want to have you know time with the girls that are already has gone to their from Houston originally and Auburn has already has gone to Houston on two or three different occasions to spend a week with 'em down there just for a child I mean so it's\nWhen I say she has this magnetic personality that draws people in in ... a really good people in and I think I've learned more about how good some of these kids are out here in the community just because of how they interact with operate [noise]\n'cause she just this kid you know my\nMy wife works in a clinic around the corner and [noise]\nShe had a kid and the other day that said hey you know [noise]\nShe found out you know kids a certain age and goes to school to shows all the you know all brie and [noise]\nLike yeah I Know All right well I'm her mom\nShe is so fun [laughter] [noise]\nI guess in the end if we've done nothing different than just get the word out and kind of [noise]\nThe inclusion piece of him being included in the law in the classroom so these normal kid [noise]\nAs these kids grow up and go into society they're going to be more inclusive Italy absolutely are places that are a lot a lot better and I think that starts in the classroom with the kids you know the people that are in the workplace for the most part right now when they were kids [noise]\nThere was exclusion you know you you you segregated these kids out and you didn't have any any interaction so I don't think they even know how to go about trying to make that happen now for the most part\nBut now since a lot of these schools are inclusive and they do include these kids and everything you know as those kids grow up and go into the community [noise]\nIf for no other reason there'll be used to it and there'll be more progressive and they'll try to get these kids involved and you know you know maybe they can't do anything but [noise]\nWe agreed or at a restaurant or you know what they're limited in certain you know factors but they can make it happen\nAnd they'll understand okay she's got limitations but this is this is something we need to do\nYour concerned about being a dad in terms\nThan that is why else I've heard\nYou know that it's easy to like the one child take up all your time and not paying enough attention\nYou know it's it yeah yeah that's something that you worry about because [noise]\nYou know they don't have a van and you know all the time to say congratulations on your normal child right you you have a case like this to raise awareness for your Down syndrome child or your special

it's not hey congratulations on being you you are such a great person [noise] but yeah you're worried about things like that are they going to take it the right way but and you have to have occasional conversations you know even with my five year old\nEspecially get her right now because my other one's been through enough we've had conversations since you understand you know um [noise]\nDoesn't understand why we're always doing something for a brief\nStart laying those the the NATO now your five year old you can understand a little bit more\nAlready thinks differently and [noise]\nThis is how her brain works [noise]\nThere are other kids that are like her and you\nSo blessed to have her in the family because you're going to learn a lot you know if you're trying to get those like less than through generically like adult schedule a time to have those thoughts but\nWhen it comments made or something I'd try to take that time to say hey [noise]\nSorry you know\nNone of us really you know choose that we're going to have a daughter 'cause as the greatest my daughter is she\nLike any other kids she has tame terms and she can't control that some time and she's got different medications that she tapes and\nSometimes those medications where all at the most inopportune time and you're gonna have to deal with that and it affects mood and all that kind of stuff so [noise]\nYou have to take all that into account and we don't choose that but you try to make sure that five year old just understands that [noise]\nThis is something like I I'm honestly think mother to kids are going to be\nMuch better all long range\nBecause they have all of this because they've had to take things they always have to think I Need to take her into account don't need to think about her what's going on with this [noise]\nYou know they get to be kids it's not like they're [noise]\nBut there are things that they have to take into consideration what other people don't
