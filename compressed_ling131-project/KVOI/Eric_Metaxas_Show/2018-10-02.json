Iraq John welcome back\nThanks Eric and I'd I'd like to point for people to an article I wrote last week which has gotten some some play the title of it that's a stream Christian glaze blazing forward abortion profit here I just want to point out this woman did work for six years\nFor a company called course heft that makes the abortion pill\nI Want to have a question John I just got to ask you a question when you told me this and I read your article and we've talked about it on the air this has gotten virtually no play not just by mainstream media who cares about the mainstream media in the conservative media Fox News which is reporting this twenty four hours a day\nHas barely mentioned this I don't know that they mentioned this this is one of the most important pieces of this whole puzzle how do you account for the fact that this woman who is their number one a witness this everything hinges on her we find out\nAmazingly that she was on this gigantic multi multi billion dollar company that produces the abortion pill how would always not talking about this\nWas on this gigantic multi multi billion dollar company that produces the abortion pill\nAlways talking about this but they're but they're only talking about this and I let her in a second going out\nYeah they don't want this to be about ... the way the White House is saying no no don't make this about abortion because we need Susan Collins is do we need Murkowski's though\nDon't make this about abortion so the ward has gone out from the White House don't make this about abortion but I'm a journalist I work for the White House and I have to point out\nThat Christine Ford work for six years for a company courtship technologies that makes one product the abortion pill now it's also used\nFor Cushing is disease okay and that's how they got an FDA approved what's for innocuous uses and then what they do what they use it off label you know the way people use opioids off label right uh only most of its revenue there that it makes like two hundred and sixty million dollars a year\nThey're not enough crushing stations on the face of the earth\nTo provide that kind of revenue so it makes its money from abortion what I Want to know what is it a disease or taps\nHas stock it what does she have stopped from what she worked there which ... which she Lewis financially if we're all the way to overturn a senator should have asked shirt that\nYou know it is a ... well see this is the whole thing and and this is why I Love you and want you on the air with me because a lot of these\nMen in the Senate and in leadership they don't have a lot of guts and basically they're so afraid of being perceived as an angry white male or a bullying white male I Want to say to anybody who accuses me of that you can drop dead either I'm speaking the truth\nAs somebody who believes in Jesus and who believes that if I don't speak the truth I answer to God I don't really care what angry people on the other side of the issue think\nI answered a God and you have a lot of senators who are so worried about being perceived in a certain way that they that they lack\nThe vigor to push back and so that I think\nThey were told by the White House it would hurt his chances of confirmation so I'm not blaming them I'm explaining it\nIf it was a strategic decision on the White House is part to get the guy confirmed not to focus on that same part of the reason for picking him rather than any Barrett or someone else who is openly pro life was to get confirmed so we need to get more seats in the Senate in ... Republican so we could appoint Alex Jones if we want\nTo ... million nine nine Alex Jones but then I just say you know let me that people don't understand that we're no fans of Alex Jones but let me let me didn't\nSay that this is parent that ugly one thing that people have to learn from what's happening right now is if you do not vote\nShame on you if you do not vote in this election\nSo that the GOP of Emmerson control ever says not mean I've got to be clear this doesn't mean that I Love the GOP there are people in the G O P\nOr even people that I like that are doing things that I don't like and so we're not talking about some across the board\nThe GOP is the only party and what the point is effectively speaking right now they are the only party this doesn't mean that you can't be a principled person or a person of strong faith\nAnd and have conflicts about voting but my point is if you do not vote and if we do not keep\nA majority in Congress and in the Senate\nThis lunacy which is fundamentally anti American that's my big issue with it it's not just that it's not\nWorking my way it's an American and its destroying the foundations of law and order and all of the things that have kept us effectively floating for two hundred and forty years those things are being destroyed because of it's a it's a scorched earth policy on the side of the Democrats it's deeply shameful\nBut I just wanted to say people need to vote\nOn November sick for the midterm elections\nIt is a rerun of the presidential election you know that hearing did not limit a world court of law where it was more like it was a show trial of the kind that left us on campuses all across America will rotting falsely accused students on flimsy evidence or it was kind of like a backroom decisions they make at Facebook and Twitter\nWhen they're deciding who to manage the monetize which pastors and they're going to silence\nAlso was a lot like a human rights commission in a state like Colorado where they sit around this discovery\nSorry deciding which Christian business they're going to bankrupt for opposing anti gay bias if we let\nIt show trial ended up in a political can politicized conviction\nLet 'em ... onto the ashes of history all of us could be next in our country is in very deep in serious trouble if we start start accepting Soviet style show trials as the way that we do politics in America\nOh is that look if that happens in this is what I talked about\nIn the ... ... in the last election and the election between Trump and Hillary Clinton the reason I said publicly\nYou must vote for Trump was not because I don't care about adultery or because I Want it to sell my soul for political power all of those cynical things that people have said about folks like me are you that that's not right people need to understand\nWhat is at stake right now America as we know it is at stake if you don't believe in law and order and you want to burn everything down\nThe Democrats are pushing forward that agenda there saying nothing matters but winning there is no good or evil it's just us versus them they want to when they want to take down their opponents they don't care how they do it and they have basically thrown the kitchen sink at Kavanaugh enact Trump\nAnd I just want to say from the bottom of my heart I Am grieved for my country and if you are not grieve for the country when you see this kind of thing you need to step back and and really try to educate yourself on civics and understand that if we don't have the rule of law in America\nIs evidence against it every person she is named has denied it\nUp as kids oh can you imagine we are as it were still argue that it's that's\nCounter of it when we when there's negative evident\nWhen we come back for him to

it was fictionalized\n... very thinly fictionalized to Italy fictionalized\n... when you mentioned is a guy named you mentioned a guy named something oh Kavanaugh\nKavanaugh was to ... so I think when\nThe George Soros team that was a scientist stop whoever Trump nominated since Supreme Court I think the law that they got the short list they started doing research on all the names and it was not hard to find the mark judge connection and they said oh wait here's a memoir that talks about drunkenness and sexual activity among teenagers\nSome of them at the same school is mark judge let's find a woman who was actually sexual us at some point in her life who's from that area and you know ...\n... maybe that's a motivation she wants a divorce illegal maybe she worked for an abortion company let's get to pick her views\nOn Capitol and we can use the details from the memoir to build a plausible story that will check out in certain the particulars because we took them\nDirectly from our judges ... memoir and let's make ... mark judge still fall guy because he admits in the memoir\nThat he he got drunk and blackout that she has memory lapses so he can't say it didn't happen because he's already admitted he has no credibility as a witness that's why he didn't want to testify before the Senate because he would just go there and get badgered by\nLiars like Senator Blumenthal who pretended to fought in Vietnam\nAnd now that's not a joke I mean the idea that you know the details on on Blumenthal in the Vietnam claims\nYeah he got as many ... trap deferments as she could finally couldn't afford it anymore and the poll whatever strangely he could to get a U.S assignment he never left us soil\nDuring the Vietnam War but he talked he won he more than once gave

when we Americans we're fighting in Vietnam another with no\nNo he said no no he was talking I think he's talking about soldiers he said you know when we were serving in Vietnam you know it was a it was in the context of fighting himself in Vietnam\nWell that's how I thought I just want to be clear but yeah yeah so we have a situation where\nUm the people uh in in the Senate on the left side of

of their best employees but I just had problems and never forgot them worth a look back and it wasn't too long looking back going ... in a while that had to happen but I might have been there for years later [noise]\nBut it would take more than one incident to really kick\nIn my living\nA real life\nMy fifth year reunion with my class everyone's now is out of college they get these amazing jobs they've started families are they've kept with the same company since high school stay\nIn my mind they were way ahead of me and it was very it was\nBothering me inside and then it was just going wow everybody's ahead of me and I'm doing stop to show up you know I got into you know I was a card counted then I took sick are counting class professional card but I hadn't even started it yet or whatever I just do it the class so I'm I'm bragging at at the reunion about skydiving with a pair of shoes not opening and\nOn my car accidents or my you know card counter things that they've never seen or the mafia coming after me you know so I'm blowing their minds\nAnd so we don't get on the topic of uh yeah how you doing for work or you do or not you know what are you doing Mike how many kids got home you know how the family you know I'm just completely\nPutting up the wall you know to these other things so they're all thinking I'm nuts basically but it was a very it was that starting there was a very much a driver and it was like there was a lot of now starting to be a shame you know I'm going you know this is\nThis is not who I can be then then I prayed I said you know God all I Want is to meet the right woman and have you know kids and and uh you know be that the white picket fence so to speak and then got brought at all to me and handed it to me on a silver platter\nUntil my could jeopardize animals or prayer all\nBy then I was very functioning cocaine addict too I look back on the ... it was perfect well no there was a lot of dysfunction even though it's hard to for the addiction to to hide it all the time the kids didn't even know that and that's so good I Would assume it was a lot of\nWork hiding the cocaine and then the crack the kids didn't know okay even like neighbors let's give our kids are sending their kids over there because we were the fund\nYou know this is back in the you know when they were younger with cocaine but then when the crack came on that took us down fast when cocaine turned into crack and and the kids\nAnd my daughter at that time and when we got right when it all kind of blew up she says we're very dysfunctional family or I don't know what that means but don't ever say that again we're not dysfunctional ... why do you mean what I've decided to just horrible I didn't know what it really really meant you know\n[laughter] so that don't sovereign [noise]\nBut I lost it all [noise] you know Mitch Lee last at all\n\nAnd in the midst of a lot of this dysfunction Mike was all ready running\nMy hello\nI Try to repeal even when I was sixteen years old I bought one of my first paychecks when to buy a pillow at that grocery store I worked at\nThis teenager spent Seventy dollars on it that would be two hundred and eighty seven dollars in today's money\nOr at all so I spent the most expensive pillow thinking it would be the best [noise] it was down below and it was the worst 'cause they you know I Know now they just sell us air I mean I I mean how can\nThat be it feels good down and goes but I couldn't return it\nThat I Do remember they would not let me return that pillow but then throughout my life I'm trying different pills and I always have problems with sleep and wake up in the morning I had a cake but mostly these sleep interruption or not being able to get to sleep right away\nSo and in two thousand four I had a very clear dream\nOf the name my pillow and wrote my pillow all over the house in connecting the wind in the pie and and you know these logos and I'm going\nThat sounds really corneal um but I go well here's my goal you know I mean if you it's hard for you to think back now because there's my everything and it was because of my pillow got big everybody took up demise but my daughter came upstairs and there was she looked and there are pieces of paper written all over and\nLizzie says she gets the glass Russia I don't know ... years old and she said what are you doing dad and I go I go I'm going to\nMemphis pillow and I know it really is I hadn't even got the you know what what is going to be made over what's going to do is going to be the best thing ever I've\nSeen it in and this is going to be called my pill and she looks at all these piece of paper she goes that's really random dad she went back down stairs well then the kids so did their mother at the time Wednesday I going to get over this pillows and he said oh it's just a phase it'll be it'll be over and I was it at that\nTime I wasn't doing anything I sold my local bar restaurant so my total focus was on this pill and then I still had to figure out the material so we tried over Ninety four different kinds of phones and fails to put it in there and one son Darren ... who's now managing\nEleven hundred twelve hundred employees of the manufacturing that's what he does now but he's like nine or ten years old and\nEvery day or you get home from school and and we tried different kinds of stuff on the deck and the phone would fly all over the neighborhood and we tried little machines to get to work and finally we get it in a work once we had the pillows all made with Margaret ... house everything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nAnd I went into the first two I walked into a was a bed bathroom beyond I'll just say the name in Bloomington, Minnesota I go in and I said\nI got the best pillow ever I said this pillows going to change you know change you're going to sell more this anything and helps this helps you sleep blah blah blah where where's your buyer who is your ... where's the manager and he looks to me because you need to leave\nAnd I'm going like I just had all this passion you know and I'm going what do you mean I Need to leave I said I Want\nTo talk to your body and I learned right away I started calling on other stores and everybody was the same shut out my brother in law's brother said why don't you do a kiosk and I said what's sad how do you spell kiosks\nAnd then we did this key us and I have a little sign of ... where I put on family owned and operated eye color in the dust and so\nAnd the other one I put chiropractor recommended and she goes\nHis then wife we can't have this she goes someone can sue us I said\nI gave one to a chiropractor our friend you know and and he loves it you know\nBut it was way far you know here's a mall and here's this in a mall just was almost too corny mean almost to real but I did we did sell about eighty pillows\nAnd the one day\nObviously we lost uh I don't know like Fifteen thousand dollars 'cause it's very expensive to have a key us on November and December and the one guy he came up and he said hey you ever do you have a card and I go out of business cards that I go oh I'm all out I sit here and I gave my number\nAnd in January of that year not cs was almost complete failure basically and borrow money from my ex book either by Christmas presents a year by the way the reason he was my ex bump you said if you quit gambling borrow your money I mean I I mean that's a you know he cared yeah\nSo this guy called me in January and he says are you the guy that invented this pill or the one guy gave my phone number two and I go yeah and he goes just changed my life\nHe says it is a miracle and he was all about that I'm going okay and the and I'm excited to hear in his you know\nNot worry about where I Am at that this is I'm going I was just so happy for him and that helped him and he goes I run the Minneapolis home and garden show would you like a spot in there and I go and I and I'm thinking to myself right away while the ... and work and I'm going to go well maybe there's more people are some you know and I'm sure I didn't have money in a\nIn a suckers had to borrow money to get in there but then I'm\nGoing to that home and garden show but what I did is I got mine them move I can sell and once I got behind it was like wow and that's what I'm seeing people they would literally come back the next day so many people after that first day of this is a miracle and same thing the guys that\nNow I'm feeding off this passion and I'm just it was like amazing where that I realized I could sell and I could sell and help people and I sold out that four days sold out I was and I'm going why this\nIs where I'm going to be I can support my family in spite of
