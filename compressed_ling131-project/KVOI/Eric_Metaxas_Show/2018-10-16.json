I didn't I didn't leave the country to get them and just you know you got them right here that is that is incredible that's all right now we got to figure out how we got to tell your story first of all when you grow up\nI grew up in Michigan Michigan lived there for twenty seven years then on December thirty first at nine forty three PM I got him when I finished up a comedy show at work or at least ... so my car was packed full of all of my items and I drove off to New York city\nAnd and why did you do that because I was doing comedy in in Michigan and I watch a lot of parking tickets and you wanted to get an area that's part of the story okay so you said I'm going to New York to do my comedy well\nIn New York I was doing comedy already been to New York if you're not funny they're way to let you know they'll say something like you know funny uh-huh\nSo I wanted to come there not not like in Michigan where people are sort of polite\nWell Dutch people in Michigan or their view and they're all phony sometimes I'm just telling you straight up right now they're all phony all those Dutch Michigan people and they will not tell you the truth and say for example hey that's how funny so you had to come to New York for that I used to play double Dutch too so uh-huh\nSort of the hurt me twice as much when you said yeah exactly on the double decker bus so we can we can sing that later but let me ask you when you came to New York when did you have a plan or you just going to come here and you know I had no\nPlan I actually didn't have any I Would I Would just like I'm gonna do whatever it takes to try to get into at least break into somebody's comedy clubs sort of comic strip lie which I think is still around ... are you there for some with diverse club I was able to finally break into it was so hard to get into this club they used to have an open Mike on Tuesday nights\nAnd is now widely broke and did you have accomplices or you just did that on your own oh cool um I thought I was going to the jokes are just have to say something like something out you know I see an opening I'm going through I see that All right I'm a ... interview slower than you broke into the club you what happened tell us a story\nFor the way to get into this club is on Tuesday nights they have a ... an open Mike\nBy seven PM comedians who are new in town start lining up at like six o'clock in the morning wait a minute really know for\nLike ... they have this whole honor system where you got Fifteen minutes to go to the restroom you have to wait like it was really hard to find them I turned to perform and is in in this comedian named George Wallace walks here who you probably know I Know George Wallace awesome to George Wallace water legend elect ... why\n\n\n\nBut it was actually show talking to Michael junior fees got a movie out called more savannah funny but I'm Still trying to know\nMichael junior um ... what is your last name or you just said it so this movie\nThat's very funny or he's\nYeah he's just a little ... but you did a great cliffhanger right before we end up you can't jump to another like it was perfect for it go for a while you are ... up in case somebody new is listening\nRight on okay so you're going to tell us why the film is called more than funny or ... why is it called more than funny\nYeah one night only people so if you go in the nineteenth you gonna be watching it renders them so you want you know and you don't want to see that you don't want yeah so ... years ago and doing a show at Los Angeles comedy club or right before I go on a stage I had a change in mindset about comedy normally when a comedian gets on stage I'm all about getting laughs when people\nRight without a ship take place for like instead of trying to get laughs when people I should give them an opportunity to a little ship right here changed everything\nWait a minute yeah that that sounds like a head game where you just did write so instead of trying to get laughs from the people you're talking about giving them an opportunity to laugh exactly okay here's my question\nWhat was it me\nOh [laughter] it means [laughter] it means intuitively as a comedian ha ha you get on stage to receive yes but my whole everything's shifted to I'm getting on stage to give and I can't tell you how it's changed everything so that same\nNight so you so this is not just so you mean as seriously that that you before you went on you had this thought you know and it ... it affected how you perform that night\nAbsolutely absolutely because here's the thing if you have a gift for someone your job is really just to present the gift it doesn't even matter how to respond to the gift your job is to present the gifts with their like it if they don't like it doesn't matter in fact what I've learned is it actually takes to control out of the audience whose hands\nSo I Do the show tonight and I leave the club and across the street among ... people are taking pictures autographs and stuff every time I leave this club don't you hate that and get away from me man backup give me my privacy backup lady who just want\nIt's not my fall I'm famous and attractive to mind get away it was just ... yeah yeah so\nI look across the street or says her most would be only been here before but not really nice area and uh I'll look across the street and I saw a homeless guy\nNow I've never seen a homeless guy outside of Columbus for ever and I've been there many times but that doesn't mean he wasn't there before but it just means before my mind was to get last people so why would I even notice homeless do so I noticed when I was like what about him how can I give him an opportunity lab\nFor real four days later this lady was an autograph line she says to me hey\nWould you consider coming to the homeless shelter where a volunteer at doing comedy and I was like a no it's just so I did I went to the homeless shelter and I'd be a comedy\nAnd it was pretty also a lot of my friends I Would have been a laugh but here's the thing I'm not there to get laughs um they're simply to give them an opportunity lab and it just so happens they see the opportunity\nSo then when we do our next tourist season I decide hey in ... in the cities we go to let's stop at a prison\nA homeless shelter abuse children facilities and less do comedy there before the big show that night so it was\nAnd let's do comedy there before the big showed at night\nSo it was bananas and then the stories I Would hear from the homeless people in these abused children are caregivers were crazy so one item on stage were about twenty two hundred people in the here and so when I Do comedy out ... and you notice because you think so it's like you're you're never really I mean if you want to\nBe in a moment you are but you can be far ahead of the moment I Try not to be in the moment yeah I'm running for my sock right now you're not even in right now right now actually I'm already I've already moved on in my mind the I'm already gone cool before you leave to further so sorry as a comedian I'm normally presented joke number one\nBut at the same time I'm doing the math on what joke number two should be based on how you respond a joke and ... and then I'll move on the job number three and start doing the math on how that joke will go based off all your ... responded to joke number one and probably will respond a joke number two\nPeople do not know that ... comedies that cerebral right but seriously that's very absolute was doing that on the fly while you're being funny while you're talking about the\nSo I used to go seven jokes deep and I wouldn't know what would be the reason I'm doing as 'cause I'm trying to get laughs when people what joke is going to get more or less what joke is going to be more or less but since I had to shift in mindset the question I'm asking in between the joke is really what can I give to his audience\nThat did this come as a result of your face or was this before the same thing happened to her house was\nAfter I became a Christian for sure I mean was because I just really feel like I'm here to really help people and most of the time that's laughter but if it's something else I have to be willing to give that as well so I'm On stage is twenty two hundred people at this event and I feel like I'm supposed to share one of the stories\nFrom the abuse children's facility I was at earlier that day\nWhich is crazy 'cause the story is not funny it's not funny abuse children is not ... not a place you go to get laughs\nExactly but remember I'm not there to get last I'm there to give them opportunity and we had been lack of propriety thirty minute ... mhm so now I feel like I'm supposed to share his story and I share them I tell them on the little boy who is being abused by his mom she was on drugs and one thing she was doing she was pulling on his tone is\nSort of whole room is froze you can imagine there are laughing at all and is she the grandmother explained to me that the little boys so afraid of his mom everywhere he goes Spiderman Acosta\nSo now it's time for me to do a show for for this little boy his caregivers and all these other abuse children and I'm On stage and I know all of their stories\nNow if my mindset was to get laughs when people there's no way I Would have been able to do the show but it was given them an opportunity last year I had to do to short part of my time so I Do the show were twenty minutes in and I hear a voice in the voice is my name is Ronan\nAnd this little boy was all this mask and you were done but we actually put we posted a video of all you do like it is bananas so I tell this to my live audience and they're just done and you think\nNo more or less going to have that after this because before that were on a scale when the ten were laughing at like a seven and a half\nDuring the story we drop to zero after story aired we probably jumped up to twelve\nAnd it's not because they were insensitive is because we went I gave him more than just funny which is what the movie is too we actually went around the country if found three stories and filmed them just like that so in the middle of the jokes you go from stand up\nTo abuse children from stand up to special needs kids from stand up to adoptive families 'cause pretty powerful\nI had to say uh you know as I'm listening to talk you sound like an incredibly nice guy\nAnd I know for a fact you're not [laughter] so I just wanted to say this has to be God oh you know what I'm saying one hundred and he got because personally I Know you're just not this nice yeah\nAnd we actually they're my by the way you know I Want to know that you are in case you didn't know though on nice ... university says this is [laughter] it's just so I mean\nIt's hard to surprise me on some level like what you're saying is very daring I mean to do that\nTakes real courage and also I Would say incredible self confidence and I don't just mean in yourself but an incredible maybe I'll put it this way incredible faith in God that he will back you up you're doing something you think is right mhm everything would tell you do not do that\nDo Hollywood but I took this going to some people say here's where I Want to do and they were like we don't know what that is and they don't it's never been done before now like this has never\nBeen done before ever like who in the world why would our it all started with me just simply actually question what can I give\nAnd that one audience show me that they want people show up to laugh to be entertained but they more times than not they actually want a little more and that's why we called this thing more than ... outside people think is extra funny but the truth is\nThat I was just going to say that more of a title implies like its extra funny but in fact yes exactly yeah that's a double entendre that you're going over there and she's now listen we're going to come to the end of the segment I just want to know do you have a last name other than junior\nOh so we'll find out on the other one does do I need to do I need to like Google you actually do that is actually at the end of the movie that's not true [laughter] it's like a big originally you don't want to ... that's right that's right no that's not true it's not really at the end of the movie really no I mean maybe\nYou don't you know you're always in a moment I don't know do nothing while put a knife to I don't even know I don't even have to continue this interview her and tell you right now folks so I'm sitting\nHere thinking grief from a funny man and let me just tell you something seriously when you tell me that you're doing this because I've never done standup but as you know when I'm speaking from some of the times I'll be funnier up I've sort of but\nTo go from that from doing funny funny funny to this other thing and then to come back\nTo do funny ... down on that to me is\nA unique I've never heard anybody doing the\n... and it's not like just water now it's the same sort of comedy I've done on NBC's Tonight Show Jimmy Kimmel so it's the same quality of comedy but it just happened to ... in fact the comedy has to be super strong in order to go with the stories that are completely cut contradicted boost to the ... you know what

by the great folks at the job creators network\nAnd today our own Alex Cortez brings us the story of an oil man out of Midland, Texas named Jim Henry\nThe Nineteen eighty four\nAll the bankers and all the consultants were predicting that the price of all was going to continue to go on the news about thirty dollars a barrel and it's going to go up to a hundred dollars per barrel except consulting cold underground me and I'll be predicted that it was going to\nPay and instead of trying to quit the price for the\nBy said what would happen if the price goes up and say well a lot richer what goes down I'd be broke\nSo I better prepare for if it goes down I don't want to be broke and I got a thing and then it said rather be around than rich [laughter] [noise]\nSo I sold half of our oil then Nineteen Ninety six it went through the floor and everybody was wrong and kept tenor crappy so we were able to withstand we got thirty people in our company we had to let Fifteen\nGuilt because we couldn't afford a motion to always terrible firing people that have helped our company a lot and then have to go I Try to find a job there were no jobs in the auto industry and I didn't think that was very ethical pressed to do it but it's kind of like\nThrowing people out of the life boat I keep like bow to flow and we've about from that day that this that we would never ever let unemployed go because we didn't have enough money\nThen when we hired the consultant named Walter Scott and he said something that revolutionized our company\nHe said Jim you're doing well pay your employees more\nI said that that makes it so we started in cities compensation program and then when our company does well our network increases\nThe employees get a quarter of an increase [noise]\nMe had Seventy five percent of the increased they'll continue to grow the company\nSo we made lots of millionaires about me back to the I guess [noise]\nIt's really rewarding see that I mean some people in our county department have like houses so [laughter]\nWe try to make sure that everybody to be taking care of not just adopt people\nIt sure that everybody to be taken care of not just adopt people\nSo I asked him a water their bonuses typically like\nProbably twice your salary [noise] get their salary plus another\nAnd that really good years they'll get prices salary bonuses [noise] people pay off has\nAnother level of rock formation in yet another\nInteresting choice to name\nWhich is below this very very and we would get very little or out at all you get to the barrel or to out and then it wouldn't produce anymore I used to type on the\nGround was too tight it wasn't me of on off for a lot of oil the flow out of it even after what they called fracking shooting a mixture of water sand and chemicals down the well\nThe break up the rock\nWas until George Mitchell came along and figured out how to track these ants\nMitchell event is Seventy eight year old entrepreneur was just trying to keep his company all live and his team have this crazy idea to try a different mixture that was mostly water and give it a special friction reduce or that allows it to be pumped at a much higher pressure\nWhat they decided to call the liquid water fracturing and everyone thought it was crazy because\nThe water would just bounce with freedom of speech off the rock and shoot back up and ... out and vote well bought it work\nThe slick water seem to go out in every direction in the wrong creating complex many networks of crap and enabling again [noise] to the surface [noise]\nTook Eighteen years to figure it out but he's the one that did you need to get more credit for that\nIn two thousand virtually no one knew what Michel team was up to and those that did all thought they were crazy he bought and are known guy named Dennis ... was also open to trying [noise]\nHe had talked to George Mitchell and he knew that Mr technique\n... was working for an energy company called arco and was just starting to have some success was to lick water experiment in the wolf hurry the combine nickname for the spray varying walk camp formations\nOn Sybil\nWas told to stop\nIn about two thousand our co sold out to BP and BP decided they didn't want to do that will bury\nWhich led the dentist self deciding to take an early retirement package this hard and you moved across the state to Texas and hope to start a consulting business [noise] a year into it it wasn't working out so well and so we\nCalled a friend from his old church in mid\nDennis Johnson just happened to be the president Enrique petroleum Johnson decided a gift selves five hundred dollars a day to console thunder rather humdrum project\nBut a year goes by and Henry petroleum it's offered the opportunity to drill on a former arch\nCoal use only two to three miles from where else had is experiments\nAnd so they called the men\nAnd we got Dennis fails to show us how he did it with our co and so we did it that way and then we got better and better at it we really to el sixty miles apart and they both got really good wells\nTypically when you're outlined the boundaries of an oil field it's all a mall\nOne mile or is it the most so we had a huge field\nAt sixteen miles wide Jim estimate that it had about ... billion barrels of oil which would have made the large this discovery in the area in the years [noise]\nAnd we thought that maybe the whole\nMiddle to base it would be good for the wolf very so we started branching out really in different places and it turned out good\nAnd so they wanted more land in the area you explore\nAnd if they had to do it all in secret so that their competitors warning catch on\nThey weren't even allowed to tell their closest family and friends about their new endeavor geologist and engineers were told the key maps and well ... locked in their desk drawers only to be taken out would need in gyms seven this so called land man and seven freelancers\nOne out poring over ... records in county courthouses hunting down the names of landowners in the area\nAnd had to convince them to lease the mineral rights below their land if there was something there the landowners would get a nice piece of the action to twenty five percent of all oil and gas revenue from their land\nAnd they\nGot a lot of land [noise]\nWe acquired three hundred and thirty thousand acres\nA tremendous amount that notion that I've ever heard anybody leasing that's about twenty square miles [noise] and then we drill down and [noise] and they'll be Monday elite just\nThey couldn't believe that we were actually making really good wells [noise] bus we put it in ... feels [noise]\nPeople said it was just yelling spray very well if they're not very good [noise] I didn't know it was a new technique in a way of\nDoing it [noise] we were making a lot of money [noise]\nSo for three years we had an aunt or ice shelf now over not drill two wells sixteen miles apart we discovered over a billion barrels of oil which is a tremendous amount of oil\nAnd I said it was going to be about three or four million barrels of oil come out of this field and I was wrong it's about thirty or forty billion barrels of all it's going to come out of the field\nAnd we had ten rigs running at one time in a hundred people and we said we don't like big\nOh I didn't know the names of all the people in our company so we decided to sell so we did we sold out to con Joe and\nWe started a foundation where we can get back to the city they gave us so much\nThe mission of the Henry foundation is refreshing for how short simple and to the point is\nFocusing resources to change the lives\nThat's it it says it all [noise]\nPutting posting resources to change lives by I Believe that you should talk by for journalists and whenever I talk to the lord he's very direct in that speech and very many words [noise]\nBut the ideas in stitching time saves nine you put fences at the top of the class to prevent Boy Scouts Girl Scouts campfires\nThose people prevent boys and girls going astray and instead of paying for ambulance because Angela says are extremely expensive\nYou can say ten lives but at the top of the hill and so you don't have to do all this Angeles at the bottom and hail\nJune could have held on to his discovery for longer and potentially made more money from it but the price of oil was that the high price of one hundred and forty five dollars a barrel\nAnd you wanted to make sure that its employees would benefit from the fruits of a high sales price that this would generate board ended up being five hundred and eighty four\nThe top twenty probably gotten over a million dollars each and the rest of them got a three or four times their yearly salary so we made a lot of people happy when [laughter]\nPlus for a gym working was never really about making money\nAt least not in the way\nWeren't really interested in making a bunch of money\nBut uh I don't take that back I was interested in making a bunch of money and foundation and use the money we started back over with twenty people\nAnd then got it going again did very well and two more years show that again\nThen from then it was hard to get back in after\nThat [noise] we finally got back in and now we're doing very strong and we have about fifty people right now [noise]\nWhat we're doing in the industry is it providing cheap fuel to heat homes\nAnd improvised fuel for cars to add\nMore making oil cheaper is now cheaper than it was the last\nAnd when we come
