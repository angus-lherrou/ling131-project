God's not dead three in three D. right Ah yes exactly okay just that but this one is is out like as of right now it yeah on\nThe other day home entertainment so people want to watch the third one when I when I first of all you know I I feel like I Know you because they read about you we met a few times but I when I heard about this third generation and the series that you got Tatum O'Neal in it I just lit up because\nFor years I Love Tatum O'Neal why because in Nineteen Seventy three Peter ... made a film\nWith a ... Ryan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal\nAnd she was the youngest actress in the history of the Oscars to win best actress\nAnd she was ten years old I think she was nine when she did it she was ten when she got the award but anybody if you want to see a great movie paper moon is one of the most beautiful funny movies he promoted just genius it's Nineteen Seventy three so she's about my age I guess\nBut it's so brilliant and you know so you watch somebody grow up you feel you know them and so how in the world do you get somebody like Tatum O'Neal or to be in your film God's not dead\nWell you know it's [noise] it's always interesting to see who's coming into these films we ... actually a lot about um who's supposed to be in them and yeah and uh and and as they read the script you know when we make the offers its it's always an interesting thing how they get connected to the\nTo the piece yeah and that was for her that was what it was she found herself just being moved she's been are being drawn close to the faith and um and this really just a you know really\nSet off a nerve or you know for a she was connected to it\nWell I Love it I neglected to say by the way that you um you're filling it would not only with the with the movie uh does not that in in terms of the acting but you are yourself\nA founding partner of pure flicks which is you know the number one indie fate studio in the world so you guys have done so many films I've ... I've lost track but the pure flex is a big deal it's an amazing thing what does it feel like is when you started this\nYou know this was a you didn't know what was going to happen\nYeah it was like the wild wild west of you know faith based films or they weren't really existing at the time um I just as you know the lord and just put it I I think each and every one of us have these dreams inside of us in God put a dream inside of me to\nTo not only be in the entertainment industry but also to tell stories or that up lift and inspired the human spirit and and with pure place that's\nUp lift and inspire the human spirit and and with pure flicks that's what we really try to do through these films is um just to tell these encouraging messages that Hollywood student studios wouldn't normally do\nIn in this day and age they they've shrunk from that they used to make films like this I mean cause they used to make a lot of films like this which is why I always watch Turner classic movies like I'm addicted to it because I Know that\nOn balance I can watch something amazing almost every night it's just phenomenal some of these old movies and then you see elements of God and faith and honor and dignity and beauty and goodness and truth and courage and\nYou realize you know you're not going to see that in the latest marvel movie at least a I'm not going to see 'cause I watch those movies anyway but um so she [laughter] and there's a whole lot of them and there's a whole lot of yeah I just I Can't it's like it's I I Can't I really don't understand why adults would go see those shows but you know what a ... who\nCares don't worry about me I'm just thinking like I I just like Turner classic movies and butter flex dot com if you've ever been there it's amazing pure folks dot com is where ... ... yeah it's like our president Netflix but it's like do you like from um said again it's your\nYeah it's like our version Netflix's faith and family films there's over ten thousand titles there are a lot of the\nClass Japan yes or no way to say I know I have heard about this but I forget stuff quickly and now it's coming back to me a tell us about that because this is this is actually amazing pure flicks dot com is your version of Netflix and you said you have ten thousand titles\nYep over ten thousand like like what\nOh my gosh like everything I mean not to mention there's originals on there and you know from from things that we've been making everything from the encounter a series too we did that ... comedy all stars was Sinbad and Louie Anderson I mean like really great quality people that come on\nYou know we're doing we're doing something with the tea Robertson coming up or\nHave you ever done anything with Victoria Jackson we love Victoria Jackson yeah it was very ... when I was telling me about that is she now that was on that program many times and she was telling me about that\nAnd I I tend not to watch like Netflix or anything like that I'm I'm sure you know I'm One of these like late adopters because of my age or whatever my daughter watches nothing else and stuff so pure flicks\nDot com I'm really glad that we're talking about this because people are looking for a wholesome alternative and wholesome as one of these words I Wish there were a better word but ah you know I think almost anything better than the word wholesome how about not crappy there you go you know something that is going to be\nSomething I Want to watch I Want my family to watch I mean we've needed this for a long time in this culture and an an alternative to Hollywood\nThe amazing thing too is when you when we look at the pie chart were able to see who's watching\nPure flex right yes there's Seventeen million hours were consumed between January in August of people watching content Seventeen million so you think about that I think about okay instead of watching the crap speaking of HBO Showtime ...\nNot it's not that there's anything wrong on crap I don't want to offend people yeah who looked crap yeah\nYeah but you know they're not necessarily pro family yeah ... most of their original contest yeah but they're watching ... because it is you know and not only Christian or Catholic when you're\nThere is a Muslim there's Hindu there's there's ... there's like all these different religions that are coming to this because ultimately I think that they also they don't want their children watching\nThat dark stuff yeah I have to say now speaking of dark or God's not dead the third one the one that's just out is called a light in darkness that's the one with Tatum O'Neal what is the plot of that film because a lot of people know the plot but maybe the first one maybe second one but what's the new one\nYeah I mean you know obviously our time has been this time of dark social political divisive ... in our country\nEverybody's hate everybody's yelling at each other's no one's listening for us how do you find how do you show both sides and bring somehow unity to a our country but also just in everyday situation with you know\nOther folks through love that's what this film is about it's about bringing unity bringing you know the hope of of Jesus Christ ultimately his love to connect and to reunite\nAnd it's rated PG mhm which means everybody can watch it pretty much\nYeah yeah I play a pastor my churches burned down my my best friend dies in it\nAnd of course the the ... the school that the church was built on which our parents had built as well it started now says eminent domain comes in and says you know what we don't need the church the churches in relevant today we need a student center there instead of the church\nAnd because of eminent domain let's just say we can't have that church there so I called my brother played by John Corbett my older brother and a and of course she happens to be an atheist and so the two of us a pastor an atheist take on you know David and Goliath\nWow a pastor and an atheist that's nice I like that I was at work now the the er I'm trying to remember\nThe um uh the the actor I'm a\nKevin ... ... was he in the ... using the first one first he died in the first one yeah he died in the first one so hate to give that chance that he can be resurrected in the fourth one\nWe believe in the power resurrection Kevin ... could come back\n[laughter] okay so Kevin I've I've I've I've got this kind of running joke that only I find funny but I always say whenever somebody you know comes down here to talk about a film and it's like a fake film or something like that I always ask is Kevin ... but when it and if they say no I said wait a second if Kevin ... than it is not a Christian feel how could they want to say what do you what do you even talking about\nHow dare you um but but uh so Kevin ... is not in this and yet it's part of the series so I think the Christian films I think it'd be grandfathered in right now because he was part of the series yeah right okay so I just want my listeners to know\nTechnically it's a Christian films um but I I ... the ... there are there are there should there could be maybe on the collectors DVD or something like that are right\nThe other faith based films and then it gets into the family entertainment highway to having the series you know the I I Believe that we have touched by an angel on that we have those classic yeah raise with John Wayne movies we have to you know\nThe funny sitcoms of old old of all these different and then the movie's hallmark movies are just like everything that's family right\nAnd faith it's because it is that's the place to go\nI'm just fascinated how how viewing habits have changed so dramatically that you know there was a time when you just turn the TV like this you know such four channels five channels\nAnd now it's like anything you want to be right back folks I'm Talking to David eight are white the new film is just out on DVD God's not dead that the third in the series a light in darkness disappear contractor so stick around\n\nI mean I Would like to talk about relief factor sure that you know what even better than than my talking about it what

last kid so I got all the names that's so cool uh okay so I Want to talk to you about pure flex we just got this one segment but\nThe what you're doing and pure flicks pure flicks dot com to ... to my mind it strikes me as the this is the future this is basically where we are now I always knew that they would come a time\nWhen you know you have these aggregators are these networks and and stuff and that's always going to have some value but it has less value I mean for example today people talk about time magazine\nTime magazine as a brand that is living off of\nWhat it was there there's really no you know there's technically at time magazine Newsweek whatever they used to be these big things the same thing with\nCBS ABC whatever it is but but they're losing you know whatever they're they're losing the market they're losing I mean the New York times has this huge name a but they they've got an a different direction\nOf people can now because of the free market took a long time but they can find what they're looking for they don't just have a couple of channels and Jeff Flake is right there somebody wants to find something chances are you with a with a catalog of ten thousand plus shows there's a lot of stuff\nYeah I mean I think that's you know it's kind of ... in a way because\nIt's scary our kids you know are watching YouTube or their ... you know they're on their phones arrived pads are all you know there's so much content coming in that it's like how do you how do you direct them to something that's positive and something that kind of has windows on it that's not going to allow them you know on YouTube anything can come up it's scary\nIs actually really scary it's horror five\nYear old our five year old or a girl and you know and you're\nOn your hands are gonna get somebody's going to have to I Hope somebody's gonna make a lot of money helping parents figure out a how to keep their kids from stumbling on to stuff like that you know there's so many different ways and hiring surges apps yeah how did it but that's what I'm saying like you're going to have to make it user friendly but\nObviously are you guys are are part of that equation offering

grandson of Billy Graham plane Billy Graham in the film\nYes that's pretty cool and that comes up that yeah\nThat his granted under way him if he's ever in a movie don't answer that question ... so it's coming out in October ... and it does it tell the face I mean\nThat goes through that whole faith thing it talks about forgiveness\nUm I mean that's the that's the nice thing about what what pure places since gods not dead at kind of opened up the time that we could you know we release between four to six movies in the theaters a year now so in a this month actually in September we release
