feed the pig dot org makes it easy they're simple savings plan teaches you how to start saving without going overboard\n[noise] so you don't need to ditch the car and start rollerblading to work [noise] [noise]\nYou don't need to start forging wild berries skeptical that are actually pretty good [noise] you don't need to do your organs on the black market lie that [noise] this is going to hurt\n... ...\nYou don't need to rent out your apartment to drifters five major fire was the word and you know\nAnd your closet door you just need an Internet connection [noise] don't get left behind start your personal savings plan with the troops in tools on feeding the paying dot org that way you don't need to sell all your belongings and live in a communist\nHungary along to all of us now brought you by the American Institute of CPAs and the ad council\n[noise] pay that against their host of the greatest city show ever wonder why some cities just seem to flourish turns out it's because they're great and bringing people together mentoring the next generation and investing in ideas that impact\nAnd it's happening in Tucson during the every Saturday on the greatest city show from three to four pm on ten thirty ... voice here about the people an idea is shaping Tucson future [noise] [noise]\nThis big nor me no one I saw the announcer and lets me do his announced if I'm always right there by his side you know it's everything you do see coughing and sneezing his wife have that much I can ignore you taught high can ignore you\nHave how men don't cough is a way to to say something a folks today is one of those day one I'm going to lay yard\nOr the the cabin on news and I think you know it's fascinating to me or this man is a has been subjected to a kind of scrutiny that almost no one in the world is ever objected to go a he has come out\nLooking clean and yet\nPartisan political people are still refusing to acknowledge it because\nI I guess this proves the point and the fear that many of us had that this ... this had nothing to do\nWith sexual assault and everything to do with making sure that this man was not confirmed to the Supreme Court now that I have to say that is what's called politics naked ugly politics and it's terrible\nAnd then it comes down to what they think he's going to do about abortion in this country that's ... well which which which by itself is so silly but then we'll put that aside put aside I mean I just want to say that\nI really have a and I've said this for a couple of years now is why I wrote my book if you can keep it I Am very concerned for my country why I'm well first of all\nThis is the greatest country in the history of the world not because I say so not because I'm a great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas of self government and freedom and basically uh\nWe have to take that seriously it's like somebody gives you an extremely valuable object worth a ... so much money it's so fragile you you can't say that it's not mine I don't care that they've given it to you even trusted with it you need to take it seriously and I think that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the Kavanaugh nomination\nA has been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle traditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now they no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake\nI'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now\nI pray for this country we always say that pray for the ...\nI mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer for this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we are we're talking about\nWhat a man did or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever and I think wow this is this is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P ... relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the uh uh an FBI probe\nOf course Feinstein and others say oh it's not the right kind of ... not deep enough it's not broad enough which really means that they won the latest forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks you've got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything I have ever seen a and so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we get a heel and that people who are naked leap part isn't\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWell a ring of fire [noise]\n\nWhich I was show I'm very excited to have in the studio again\nI'm a couple of new friends or David ... who's with the alliance defending freedom you know about them I've talked about them on this program there's a banner on our website or you can find out more about them and we have ... Kelvin\nCochrane ah whose case uh being fired after seven years as the fire cheap in Atlanta\nFor having had the audacity to write a book in which he mentions what the Bible says about\nSexuality oh my goodness gentleman um I'm thrilled to have you back to talk about these things because the owner to be here is is this a wonderful and you know are we talked last time we were together achieved talking about your story but there's so many other\nStories out there right now and I know a ... David equipment you as senior counsel and VP of litigation\nAnd ATF you've seen these stories I think a lot of Americans just don't believe that this kind of stuff happens in America or if it happens it's very very rare but the other side\nSeems to be very nasty and very litigious they want to come after people\nSo it goes against the narrative that we were just told those live and let live let let people live their lives ... now we're seeing that no if you dare step out of line if you publish a book where you mention what the Bible says about sexuality you're going to pay a price\nThat's nasty that is not tolerant but that is what's happening and I'm sitting here with a man that happened to you or a chief Cochran I mean I Wonder if some of these other cases that we're seeing right now or that you you yourself David have litigated\nIt's incredible because it's not limited to New York or California or the places you would think it's everywhere in the Bible belt if in Georgia it's in Kentucky it's from coast to coast so people think well those are in isolated spots around the country they're not they're everywhere\nAnd as we mentioned last time if they can come after that the chief they're going to come after anyone\nAnd we've got cases are throughout the country we've got 'em we people I've heard from the Supreme Court case about masterpiece cake shop what's amazing about that if they're all those years we've got a gentleman who has a bakery who serves everyone but because he's a Christian he doesn't do all messages and promote all the vets\nSo he doesn't do for example Halloween cakes he doesn't do cake celebrating divorce that people do sometimes he doesn't do anything against God or family or country patriotic gentleman as as the chief is\nAnd so when someone came to him and said we want you to bake a cake to celebrate to participate in our same sex wedding ceremony he said look I can sell you anything in the store I could make any other cake\nThat specific I cannot celebrated promote that event because it violates my beliefs they go against him they sue him we go all the way up to the Supreme Court recently read a great victory you've talked about that well apparently it's not over because they've come after him again okay they basically have an activist now\nWho set him up in came after him and said we want a couple of things I Want to kick\nThat celebrates their transition from a man to a woman that got that goes from pink or blue on the outside to pick on me\nAnd they're finding discrimination and going against him again\nOkay so this is so this is what I Want my my listeners uh to to understand because again I Know a lot of good people in America they just they have this idea I was one of them you have this idea that listen if I just keep my head down and be good person nobody bothered me\nJak Philips is the definition of a good person he is friendly to gay people he\nIs not a big it okay so if somebody comes to him a while ago and says we want you to bake a cake celebrating our same sex marriage and he poll lightly poll likely he doesn't say you know hey fags get outta my store he doesn't ... he\nIs a loving generous man now you'd think that he would have said something like that that he would pick up a baseball bat and said I'm not going to serve your kind whatever absolutely not\nHe says that anything that that goes against my religion including baking a Halloween cake he would not pick a Halloween take you will not bake a cake that says down with the u._s._a.\nI mean it's like going through a portrait artist is the same thing and saying like you know I I Want you to paint my portrait and my wife's portrayed and we're going to be naked and we're gonna have swastikas on us right we're going to pay you and you got to do it\nNo you don't got to do it right so if you go to this guy he's he's a he's the name of the the stores masterpiece cake I mean it's this is he's doing art there's just not just like he's selling you hamburgers okay so\nHe is persecuted because somebody says we're going to ... we want to cause trouble we're going to come in there and we're not we're not we're going to we're going to say if you do not bake a cake celebrating or same sex wedding\nOr your you know you're you're going to get it you're going to get it so so this nice man has to go to the Supreme Court thanks to you in ATF and everybody he\nWins the case okay\nSo we think we're done with that\nAnd now you're telling me that somebody in Colorado\nHas decided to come after him and if ever anybody needs proof this is why I wanted to talk to you about this if anybody needs proof\nOf the nastiness of the vindictive ness of the other side on this this is not live and let live\nThey come to him deliberately to cause trouble\nAnd they say we want you to already knowing he's jak Philips already knowing you one of the Supreme Court they come to him and say we want you to ... bake a cake celebrating transition from men to women is that right okay that it's almost funny like they want him to do this they want the cake to be but as a blue on the inside them but whatever I think on the outside or whatever\nBut here's the kicker and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to say this for my listeners so they can get this if you want to understand what you're dealing with right now folks listened carefully\nBecause I read this the people wanted him to put a satanic symbol on the top of the cake\nAnd it's just it's a satanic figure performing a sexual act if I were to describe it\nOn the program it would have to be censored I I don't do a program where children cannot listen we're husbands wives cannot listen without getting embarrassed but what these people asked this Christian man jak Philips this humble man\nOr to do was vial pornographic satanic genuinely pornographic we're not talking soft porn\nAnd they decided we're going to play with this guy working at where we want this kind of trouble that's how vicious they are so now that this happened where\nAre we so here's what's incredible about so you have an activist who set this up and they file a complaint with the civil rights commission which are not there to name only and and rather than seeing it for what it is as a set up with this pornographic vile say panic\nCake or they basically find cause to investigate are now going after him again now this government commission that set up\nWhich are completely biased to set up in the first break in fact what's interesting about these commissions one of the requirements is and and\nJust think if this would ever be allowed for a jury right\nThat the majority of the commissioners\nHave to be someone who is either in would be discriminated against or is part of a group of people that that would have been discriminate wait a minute wait a minute you're kidding me that's that's built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so they said they set that up\nThat's right and and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack Horner minding their own business\nPeople like the cheap or minding their own business\nAnd it's it's not activists were out there and people's faces these are people living their lives according to their faith and they're actually finding them seeking them out and going after them in jurisdiction\nOkay so this is why I say if if real Americans do not stand up against this violence is if this is my listeners folks this was you right now right if you don't stand up now and do something\nOr if you don't if you don't understand that this is happening you're you're going to be part of the problem you cannot stay silent because the people have soda so to speak come at a closet on the other side they're no longer pretending to be nice nice they're not playing Patty cake no pun intended they are out\nFor scout they want to take down anybody who dares defy what they say and we're talking about nice people like the chief who sitting right here nice people like Jack folks in other words the real big it's\nThey don't want anything to do with the real big if they want to come after nice people who are definitely not bigots and they want to say we're going to make an example of you you're going down we have the courts on our side we have the media on our side and it's why I said in my small platform on this radio program I Want people to know\nIf you allow this to go on you cannot complain when they're going to they will come after you are somebody because this is how nasty it as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys are are practically the only game in town I mean you have been doing this for years fighting this battle\nAnd it amazes me that you have pro bono lawyers how many lawyers do you have across the country that are working for you guys\nSo we have about sixty five lawyers internally for ATF but then we have a over three thousand lawyers were allied attorneys are also of committing pro bono our okay\nUm this is happening the people that I met I met jak Philips is an absolutely staggering to me that in this day and age good people are are are are being the victims of this kind of intolerance and America unfortunately\nYou better wake up we better wake up we'll be right back to talk more with the alliance defending freedom stick around [noise]\nHey Alvin hey how are you I Want to have early factor okay and I tell you begin to address for example really factor we get these

freedom I'm sitting here in the studio with chief Calvin Cochran whose story we told a on this program and David court men who serves as senior counsel MVP of us litigation with the lights defending\nFreedom you guys do what you do for free which is why I Hope people will understand that and and give a\nTo what you do so how does it work I mean there are people all across America as we're having this conversation being intimidated or teachers are being intimidated people everywhere are being intimidated in fact sometimes they need to make themselves by self censoring they say oh I better not say that because I get in trouble and I think\nThat is that it's flat out wrong when you when you in America you have the right\nTo religious liberty you have the right to talk about your faith where ever you are we all know when it gets appropriate\nBut the point is that when people self sense I don't want to I don't want you to oh yeah you don't want to share the good news you don't want to you don't want to help a kid in your classroom whose life is all messed up and and you could share with the kid after class about about God or something like that it's like now I better not have better not\nSo people can\nCome to you in and say\nOkay I'm being persecuted first of all how do they reach the alliance defending freedom if somebody has a genuine case\nSure I mean there are several ways to reach us that we have a one eight hundred number one eight hundred tell ATF um ATF legal dot org is our website but what's what's what's amazing about about that is is what the other side is so good at is is name calling and ... and accusing\nSo what better way to to win a debate if the silence the other side and the way they do that is by putting you know you're a bigoted homophobic you're a hater I mean how much are we heard all that stuff\nAnd so what happens if someone says well I don't want to speak up because then I'm a hater or I'm I'm a big at all those names are meant to silence you rather than having a debate on the issues we get into this ... that has nothing to do with what's going on and simply to silence folks but I think you're right by telling people to to to take a stand\nAnd there there are people there are are so called Christians are who are confused on this where I I haven't been called like on Twitter accused of making like a racial remarks I thought ... these people are saying they don't know what real racism is they don't know where we'll bigotry is I mean go around the world where you will see\nReal bigotry real racism\nBut people are are so sensitive now that you're afraid to talk\nAnd I I Want to say I want to be a leader in this and say folks\nThis is not right this is like\nThis is this something viral when in a free country groups are trying to tell you shut your mouth do not share ... even if what I Want to share is wrong I have a right as an American to speak my mind even if I'm a fool\nI have the right to speak in America so I'm not telling you you have to agree with me but I have the ... have the right to speak but we're self censoring people are afraid and as you said\nThat there's there are people out there that they know they they can't win the argument so all they can do is say shut up and if you don't you lose your job you'll be ... you know\nThat is it's so violent I think most people when they really get into like they get angry they said this is this is despicable I'm not going to stand for this I Hope people listen to this program understand\nThis is not right and you need to be part of the battle I don't know what that means uh some some people can write a big check the ATF I Hope they will other people can just educate themselves and speak up when you get an opportunity because if you don't speak up some day folks you won't have the ability to speak up we're getting we're getting there\n[noise] yeah and what's what's interesting you mentioned this happens in schools that happens is at colleges and universities I mean if if people follow the news there are\nThese biased response teams which means if a student says something that happens to offend someone they report them\nThe administration then comes after them with its like sensitivity training and so they're actually going into these situations where you can't speak your faith because obviously that's going to offend someone I'm trying to shut the students down even before they get into their\nCareers and into into the public square so they're getting about a young age teaching them that it's better not to share your faith which obviously we know it's important to do so and they're getting them when they're young\nIntelligent talk twenty four seven AM ten thirty or why torture narrowed to shock on the

investors warned thrilled I mean they just pop down six million and then this tune up to the derby just a terrible run and they thought what we've done\nWith the derby just two weeks away serious questions arose about the jockeys ability to guide secretary to victory in the first leg of the triple crown secretary trainer Lucian Lauren didn't know what to think but others were losing confidence

which is obviously what was in his blood\nIs the first tours to run the mile and a quarter derby and under two minutes secretary turned would have been uneasiness and Louisville into confidence in Baltimore\nYou went off as a three to tend to favor in the Preakness Stakes at pimco race course where I live just six miles away and spent my favorite Saturdays in my life for eight years this is the tightly turned second leg of the triple crown\nIt's almost ready to ours is just about to move into that started again the weather is perfect and we're just waiting for a fine horse race\nStill running the closest style and stuff for us we carry ... changed and chemical is considered that ... that was the one that was where I\nAm I on the on any of that rain on the outside it totally size and it's also touching on the outside in the Preakness\nHe broke last again\nNow he's going to the turn you think it's going to be the same thing as the derby\nSecretary again and they\nTook a took a

and the derby well considered like a middling race the similar do the Preakness well that's a sprint that's in Baltimore only two weeks later and then four weeks later off to New York for the Belmont and that is a mile and a half\nWhich is well it's like a marathon for a horse it's a whole different kind of breathing allows you to win the sprint the mid and then of course that long haul race in New York\nAnd so few horses have done it and so few did it in the way that well the way the secretary I did it was just remarkable by the way\nWe did a story about one triple crown winner American
