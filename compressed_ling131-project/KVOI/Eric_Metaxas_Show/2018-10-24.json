California in in Redding, California had horrific fires\nYou know those of us on the Gulf Coast where we're not tuning into this but\nCan you tell us what what happened because this is your you guys are in northern California your way up there\nTell us I mean these are some of the worst fires that ever happened so so if you don't mind and lump people hear about this because people have heard about about Bethel a church in Redding, California and they you know a lot of people know about the music and the prophecy and stuff but you know what you've been through so tell us if you would\nYeah we've been through we've done to help actually seventh worst fire I think in the United states third worst in California a bill I just burned thousands and thousands and thousands of acres it ah thirty eight percent of our of our residents in in reading were evacuated\nA eleven hundred people lost their homes that's not including businesses and structures and so it was is quite devastating the fires have a pretty much been out\nFor ah probably about a week and a half two weeks so our sky was full of smoke everybody sharp was full of a ... it was it was pretty horrific and uh we you know our city our city a ... interesting I was in D.C at the time\nAnd the fire started my wife and my and all my kids evacuated 'em to another location\nAnd uh and in the midst of it the lord said uh to me I'm a remember I I I I said you've I set you up for this time\nI was a sixty one one through four has been my versus you know from a probably lots of other people's too but I've sold them a while back when I first became a believer in you know he wants to give us beauty for ashes\nSo literally we have ashes and literally the Lord's given us beauty and so we're in a restore recovery stage right now a city's the getting back to normal\nMy one way and\n\nYour show\nI'm Talking this hour with personal validation of who's the author of poverty riches and wealth moving from a life of lack into true kingdom abundance a Christian I mentioned at the beginning it you are ah one of the the main pastors at Bethel church in Redding\nCalifornia and we're just talking about the fires uh that had been going on there you are the co founder of the battle school of supernatural\nMinistry you written many books and then this book as soon as you read a time like poverty riches in wealth moving from a life of lack into to kingdom of ... a lot of people right away think like\nThat is prosperity gospel that is the name it and claim it God Knows me you know Cadillac in three houses and so what do you say that those people\nBut I Would say that I have a message as much as anybody in the church and I think that sometimes when we react to a bad message sometimes we the reaction treats force doctrine than what we are reacting to\nCorrect so I think that we should be careful not not just on this subject but I think I've watched you know I've been a Christian since I was Eighteen years old sixty three so it's been a while and I've watched the\nChurch do this or I'm sure you have to Eric where somebody preaches something to extreme and then we run away from that treat another extreme right and that's right it\nIt's that there is a healthy way to actually take on every subject and I think there is a balance and every subject and I also believe that all truth is held intention so you know if you if you uh\n... if you read through the Bible you see that some people when you say the Bible contradicts itself\nAnd and I would say that the Bible\nOr often shares to extremes and the only way we know which one to embrace in our life at the time as is by the Holy Spirit so I I think that yeah the message been abused and that's a great reason to write a book about the truth about poverty richest ...\nI I agree and I and I think what happens one of the the the over reactions uh to the name it and claim it prosperity gospel is to somehow\nMake an idol of poverty when you make it sound like you're having anything is worldly having any kind of riches is worldly Jesus didn't have anything therefore I shouldn't have anything in any think wait a minute wait a minute ... is is that right I mean if you have money you can help people who need money if you have health\nOr you can help people who don't have health\nIf you have freedom you can help people who don't have freedom a God gives us these gifts for his purpose is not just some heat wealth on to us but the whole point is whatever it gives us his for his purposes but to say I don't want any of that stuff\nI'd rather be poor and sick and so people make doctrines out of this and uh and you're right that that is that it's as on biblical as making a doctrine that you know God Knows me a mansion and a and a yacht\nYeah yeah and I think you know of a few things that [noise]\nYeah I think you know of a few things that you know we have to think about and I I Know I'm ... and be a little bit funny here but you know if you don't like well if you're not going to like heaven\n[laughter] because God describes you know heaven as gold streets or a pro gates you know fresh\nJust went on but isn't that just as evidenced filled with those hypocrite Christians\n[laughter] I Would never want to go to places like that I'd rather hell when you can during the year and have a good time and you know you have an honest people\nWho have tattoos and stuff yeah it's just so stupid you know it's it's kind of funny you you you say that so you're you're saying that haven't is going to be so wonderful and to some extent our lives on this earth can reflect and that doesn't mean the finances but the point is there's a connection so tell us about that\nWell my point it would be this let's say I'm Talking about is wealth inherently evil is well inherently evil because there are a lot of people who actually would teach that that money is the root of\nAll evil yet ... says is that\nNo no it says the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil not all evil\nAnd it's the love of money and to think about this if if ... was inherently bad inherently bad\nInherently evil when Jesus say you know would you say something like what happens is going to be you know it's going to be like opium fields of marijuana gardens\nBut you know most of us were thing no those things aren't inherently good for you yeah so you know if wealth is inherently bad and then you know the other challenge and you're just mentioned a second ago you know people are like Jesus was poor I'm like okay well Paul does make a statement that Jesus became poor so that we could become rich\nAnd and what does what does poor meat in in the days of Christ because if you think about this you know we're talking about agricultural\nA fishing agriculture basic you know the basic uh industry of the day and Jesus makes wine for water in thirty seconds so think about all the things he circumvented there was no planting the vines there was no pruning advisors do pick you know the grapes\nThere was no crushing the grapes there is no fermenting and the wind that he makes is better than anyone ever tasted so if Jesus could make one from water Jesus is not poor and then marries the one his mother said to Jesus they're out of wine\nAnd she said what does that have to do with me and my question would be because that was chooses first public ministry how that married no the cheeses could make one unless Jesus was doing it at home\nYou now do you think that's the that's funny I never would have thought of that I'm not sure I Would agree with that that sounds very very interesting yeah and maybe he was pulling this all the time she's like we only have water and he's like well I think mom I I can fix that\nWe only had only got is baloney and the stale bread mom I got it\nUh I I don't I don't know all I Know is that\nWhen Jesus turns water into wine is a picture of abundance or the da da da di di di di di di tastes too good might be alcohol like now we really should be drinking we should be drinking we tea\n[laughter] be Italian more than ... million\nDoesn't not tell you does it not does not demonstrate the nature of a God who loves to have fun at a wedding\nAnd here here's a here's another one arugula this one I'm sure you probably thought about it the boys are on ... or ... or fishing right this is what they do for a living there not sport fishing fishing for a living this happened at least twice Jesus Walks out on the shore\nAnd he's like hey if you guys caught anything you know that's a very common fishermen talking to other fishermen hey you guys caught any fish\nAnd they all know with no fish\nAnd Jesus as to take your net you can sit on the other side I'm thinking like you know the boys already said hey we've been fishing all night I'm thinking a fist all night you probably fish both sides of the book\nEspecially if you're caught nothing right well they catch so many fish it starts to sink the freaking boat right and they have to call for their ... their competitors come over to help them right\nAs soon as the as soon as the as soon as the the Mets are so full of fish that it's about thinking the boat John turns to Peter and says I think that's the lord they don't recognize it's the war until they catch so many fish it's almost it's\nAlmost sinking their vote and my point is can you imagine if they caught free Mentos you know hey cash or not on his side of the boat and they kept three Mentos they go oh that must be the lord he's so frugal\nWell and actually this is no joke I heard my my a pastor preached on this\nFew weeks ago and the the initial plays with this happens is in Luke five and they have barely on the gun they're ministry and that's when she says I'll make you a fisherman but what's so interesting to me\nIs that this happens at the beginning of his ministry he says cast units out because they've pushed out from the shore and they they catch so many fish that it's sinking boats they don't know what to do\nAnd then three years later Jesus is justified and he he he right is is written from the dead he's appearing the disciples were and then one day they're out in in John Twenty one they're fishing out there they're sort of despondent what are we go from here\nAnd some guy in the short says hey catching it and that's having a boat and they do it and the catch a hundred fifty three fish and it seems to me\nThat the reason they knew it was Jesus was because he had done it three years before it's kind of like they realize this is the God who does this\nAnd hinder last is he overwhelms us with blessing he loves the so much we can't even take it\nAnd that's who he is when we come back folks were going to continue this conversation with Chris Valentine in the book is poverty riches in well moving from a life of lack into true kingdom abundance\nOr I think before actually Chris before we go I have to mention something alliance defending freedom folks were doing a raised with them right now this is very important\nOr if you do not mind do too\nMuch tax us talk dot com alliance defending freedom is fighting for our religious liberty this is so important to me I don't want to forget to mention it I Will give me the number a later on but if you just go to my taxes talk dot com as you know are in Washington state they sued\nBut they're actually not wealthy people and I know a lot of other people who they are wealthy people but they don't necessarily have a lot of money but they do have a can do attitude they do they are full of faith\nAnd they and they are like everything works out for good in the end kind of people so I I I I Want to just point out that wealth is a power and I always I I kind of picture like this Matt gets you know I played with maggots a lot when I was kid and if you turn you know to the to North towards each other they they repel\nBut if you switch them around and a half north of the south they connect and I think that there really isn't invisible force to poverty\nOkay Hannah Hannah right there that's a great place to and we're going to be right back folks I Want to unpack that idea stick around\nPay out Ben hey can I tell you about really fat or at least to the no no I'm asking you can I oh yeah you may you mean I I I may you're from it but I tell you what we've got somebody else who's going to talk about really factor let's hear from her first her name is sue here it is\nI suffer with how about ... thirty or cut off from work on our stuff and I drove up to find something that would help them home when I heard about the quick star program or order a rover will help our old friend\nOkay that sue right now I was just with my relatives down in Atlanta for a

I think that\nThere there are as a force in in the kingdom that actually attracts wealth now I I Want to reiterate not just talking about money I'm Talking about favor\nI'm Talking about the sense of being empowered I'm Talking about the can do attitude that nothing's impossible with God there is if there is a force it\nIt is invisible but tangible force that attracts wealth to people and I also believe that there's an invisible force\nThat actually detracts wealth or or attract poverty and if you think about it you know the richest country the richest continent in the world for natural resources is the continent of Africa\nAnd today it is as a continent is the poorest continent world so what's the problem\nI mean what's the real problem and obviously it worked in Africa for more than Twenty years so I you know I realize that people for billions of dollars into Africa or the bill gates foundation's pouring billions of dollars in Africa and I proposed that they need more than money there is it mind shift\nThat needs to take place in in most of Africa I realize that's a lot of countries\nBut uh that actually tracks poverty and needs to be shifted\nWell aren't you talking I mean ... we don't want to make it sound so mystical ... you're talking about demonic powers I mean the fact of the matter is that a lot of us in ways that we may not be aware\nAre are are subject to demonic powers in our lives we open doors through our actions through our thought life a lot of people I Know some people that they say\nNegative things constantly now I I can be that way I have a tendency and I got to watch myself but I Know friends that they have a team they say negative stuff\nConstantly and I want to say to them you can you got to stop that because you don't understand the power of your words when you say stuff like that you're you're um how do you think of power to these negative ideas and an empty you know ... some people taking the wrong way and it sounds weird and mystical to the point is we create an image of God\nAnd we have power whether we know it or not any better know it because you have power your words have power and we can sometimes allow\nDemonic influences a free rein in our lives and that seems to me a part of what you're talking about it in Africa for sure there are our full demons or over some of those countries horrifying stuff\nAnd as you just a little a point in ... in a point that you just made life and death or the power of the time life and death and sometimes we're talking ourselves to death\nAnd so I think it's really important that you know a faith works in both kingdoms like fear fear is faith in the wrong king them think about this is a little boy says I'm going to kill you he's three years old I don't get if I'd I don't feel fear 'cause I'm like I don't believe he has the power to do that\nBut if I Wonder if I'm walking the street demand with a gun comes up and says I'm going to kill you\nI have fear because I Believe\nThat he has the power to do so faith theater is faith in the wrong kingdom and what I'm getting at is that people think\nThat we receive just good stuff from faith but I Would propose that when we believe in the enemy when we believe in the enemies words when we believe in you know nothing there was nothing good skin to ever happen in my life when I wake up every day with a foreboding spirit that says you know uh I'm having a good day but a bad day is coming\nAnd challenging talk twenty four seven AM gym three GeoEye ... to shock on the Web at ... dot com\n[noise]\nNews

depressed or a morose as I should be I'm Sorry to disappoint you\n[noise]\nUh and I assure you I Am not in denial it's not like I'm not aware of what's going on my family my three kids my wife we just the camp we bought a lovely house in Chesapeake, Virginia near Norfolk and we're doing that because that's a better place for the family to be down the road\nAnd the other thing is I Am in nominally good health right now I mean there's the greatest thing of cognitive dissonance you will ever see is the fact that I Am in really good shape in fact I'm In better shape than most of you sorry so what we're not talking about today we're not talking about cancer\nBecause I spend a lot of time talking about that I'm really not interested if you have any herbal supplements remedies please stay away from me\n[laughter]\nSo we're not going to talk about things that are even more important than achieving a childhood dreams were not going to talk about my wife and I felt my kids because I'm good but I'm not good enough to talk about that without tearing up so we're just going to take that off the table that's much more important\nThan we're not going to talk about spirituality and religion [laughter] um so what are you today to talk about them is about my childhood dreams and have achieved them I've been very fortunate that way how\nI Believe I've been able to enable the dreams I've been able to enable the dreams of others and to some degree lessons learned I'm a professor there should be some lessons learned and how you can use the stuff you here today to achieve your dreams or unable to dreams of others and as you get older you may find that enabling the dreams of others\nThing is even more fun and that's something we should not lose sight of is that the inspiration and the permissions dream is huge so what\nWere my childhood dreams you may not agree with this list but I was there a [noise]\nBeing in zero gravity playing in the national football league ... author an article in the world book encyclopedia I guess you can tell them early and I wanted to be an imagine here with us\nAnd uh it turns out that NASA\nSomething called the vomit comet than they used to train the astronauts and this thing does parabolic arcs and at the top of each argued about twenty five seconds where you ballistic\nAnd you get about ... rough equivalent weightlessness for about twenty five seconds and there is a program where college students can submitted proposals and if they win the competition they get to fly\nAnd I thought that was really cool and we had a team and put it together and they want and they got to fly I was all excited 'cause I was going to go with them\nAnd then I think the first brick wall because they made it very clear that under no circumstances were faculty members allowed to fly with the teams I Know I was heartbroken right it was like but I work so hard [laughter]\n\nAnd so I read the literature very carefully at turns out that NASA it's part of the outrage and publicity program and it turns out that the students were allowed to bring a local media journalists from their home town [noise]\nRandom House Web journal is really easy to get a press pass so guys on Nassau and I said I Need to know where to fact some documents and they said what documents are you gonna facts as I said my resignation as the faculty advisor and my application as the journalist [noise]\nAnd he said that's a little transparent don't you think [noise]\nAnd I said yeah but our project this virtual reality and we're going to bring down a whole bunch of the our headset and all the students from all the teams are going to experience at an all this other real journalists are going to get to film it sounds a dream number one check\nAll right let's talk about football my dream was to play and the national football league and must have you don't know that I actually no um [noise]\nYou know I did not make\nIt to the national football league but I've probably gotten more from bats dream and not accomplishing\nIt then I got from any of the ones that I did accomplish um I I had a coach I signed up when I was\nNine years old I was the the smallest kid in the league by far and I coach Jim Graham was six foot four he'd play line backer at Penn State he was just this hope of a guy and he was old school I mean really old school like he thought the forward pass was a trick play [laughter]\n\nAnd he showed up for practice the first day and you know this big hulking guy we were all scared to death of him and he hadn't brought me football's\nHow how are we going to have\nWithout any ball and one of the other kids said excuse me coach but there's no football\nAnd coach Graham said right how many men are on a football field of time it was eleven on a team twenty to encourage Graham said All right and how many people are touching the football at any given time or one of them and he said right so we're going to work all of those other Twenty one guys are doing and that's a really\nGood story because it's all about fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals fundamental you've got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn't going to work and the other Jim Graham story I have is there was one practice where he just wrote me all practice just you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong ago back into it again you owe me you're doing pushups after practice\nAnd what it was all over one of the other assistant coaches came over and said\nYeah coach grim roads are pretty hard and they said yeah he said that's a good thing you said when you're screwing up and nobody's saying anything to you any more that\nMeans they gave up and that's the lesson that stuck with me my whole life is that when\nYou see when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody's bottom to tell you any more that's a very bad place to be your critics are your ones telling you they still love you wouldn't care um and the other thing about football is we send our kids out to play football or soccer or swimming or whatever it is\nAnd its first example but I'm going to call a head fake or indirect learning we actually don't want our kids to learn football I mean yeah it's really nice and I have a wonderful three point stands and that I Know how to do a chop walk and I was kind of stuff but we send our kids to learn much more important things teamwork sportsmanship perseverance et cetera et cetera\nAnd these kinds of head fake learning are absolutely important and you should keep your eye out for them because they're everyone\nThought civil one being an author in the world book encyclopedia when I was a kid we had the world book encyclopedia on the shelf and after I had become somewhat of an authority\nOn virtual reality but not like a really important one so I was at the level of people the world book would\nBadger uh they called me up on that I read an article and I'll just Caitlin kill her and the\nThere was an article if you go to your local library where they still have copies of the world book look under vie for virtual reality under\nIt and I'll have to say is that I'm\nHaving been selected to be an offering in the world book encyclopedia I now believe that ... is a perfectly fine source for your information because I Want to follow the controllers for real encyclopedia\nThey let me and I'm Sorry my next one being an imaginary\nThis was a hard one\nI Believe me getting zero gravity is easier than becoming an imaginary uh\nWhen I was a kid I was eight years old and our family took a trip across country to see Disneyland and if you've ever seen the movie national lampoon vacation\nShe was a lot like a quest and these are real vintage photographs or\nAnd there I Am\nIn front of castle and there I Am and for those of you who are into foreshadowing this is the Alice ride [noise]\nAnd and I just thought this was just the coolest coolest environment I'd ever been in and instead of saying gee I Want to experience this I said I Want to make stuff like this\nUh I loved imaginary it was just a spectacular place just spectacular everything that I have dreamed I Love the model shop people crawling around on things the size of this room that are just big physical models that\nIt was just an incredible place to walk around and be inspired and then at the end of my six months they came to me they said\nYou want to do it for real you can stay\n\nAnd I said no but it worked out okay and if they hadn't said stay here or never walk in the building again\nI Would have done it I Would have walked away from tenure I Would have just done it but they made it easy on me they said you can have your cake and eat it too and I basically become a day a week day a week and sold them for imagine hearing I did that for about ten years and that's one of the reasons huge all become professors\nBecause you can have your cake and eat it\nAnd when we come back more uh Randy power and he was ...\nAnd when we come back more of Randy power and his remarkable west select you're born in this day in history in Nineteen sixty his story continues here on

excitement of putting on a show for people who were very excited about it I think that that's one of the best things you can give somebody the chance to show them what it feels like to make other people get excited and happy I mean that's a tremendous gift\nRight so now the third part of the talk lessons learned that we've talked about my dreams we talked about helping other people and they're below dreams somewhere along the way there's got to be some aspect of what let you get to\nAchieve your dreams first one is the role of parents mentors and students I was blessed to have been born into two incredible people\nAh my dad was so full of life or anything with him was an adventure I don't know what's in that bag but I Know it's cool [noise]\nAh my dad dressed up as Santa Claus but he also did very very significant things help lots of people are this is a dormitory in Thailand my mom and dad under roads\nAnd every year about a\nThirty students get to go to schools wouldn't have otherwise and some of my wife and I have also been involved in heavily\nAnd these are the kind of things that I think everybody ought to be doing helping others ... but the best story however my dad is unfortunate my dad passed away a little over a year ago\nAnd when we were going through his things he had fought in World War two in the battle the bold and when we were going through his things we found out he had been awarded the bronze star for valor\nMy mom didn't know it\nIn fifty years of marriage and it just never come up\n\nUh my mom a mothers are people who love even when you pull their hair [noise]\nAnd ah I have two great mom stories when I was here studying to get my PHD and I was taking something called the theory qualifier\nWhich I can definitively say is the second worst thing in my life after chemotherapy [noise]\nAnd I was complaining to my mother about how hard this test was and how awful it was\nAnd she just leaned over and she kind of me on the arm and she said we know how you feel honey and remember when your father was your age he was fighting the Germans [noise]\nAfter I got my PHD my mother took great relish introducing me as this is my son he's a doctor but not
