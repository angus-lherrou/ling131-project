the votes that were to borrow a and it looks like that when I was going to be a surprise if he if he's not a good ... phone number is eight\nBy five to nine five sixty six hundred Janet thank you for waiting welcome to the program I Janet\nHi how are you good go ahead\nI'll take it uh well you know I look at this gentleman just called in earlier saying how can you about when you have enough took those have not checked those papers from right the Democrats and we're going to look into that right so I've been listening to this I Want to follow everything I Swear to God\nAnd um what's been brought up is that when the\nYou know when the Democrats take the house they're going to investigate it they're going to ask for all of his paperwork 'cause they only got ten percent of it they're going to look into this and start pooling thing because I think there is now maybe maybe it maybe these people are just laugh but um you can teach\nU.S Supreme court justice sure and if he if he lied\nIf he like do you believe that that you know justification for him not being a Supreme Court if he lied under oath how do you feel about that\nWell I I I didn't have a lot of chance to really do proper research but I saw the war that I saw the White House ... I did I looked at the Washington Post article about it and\nYet is it is one of those where he has been asked about these documents that came into the Bush White House that were\nDocuments for senator lady who was a Democrat from Vermont and they were part of the strategy because Brett Kavanaugh was it was both shepherd through a judicial nominees and they were looking at somebody\nAnd some guy brought him all these documents and everybody says he should have knowing\nThat these were stolen documents and he has said consistently under all of his background investigations I did not know they were stolen I did not know that they were anything other than documents that were a lane out or something or regarding this nominee\nSo he's claiming that's where I didn't know\nHow do you yeah and they how do you prove that split that he knew\nThey have attacked the habitat this is what they're saying that they would do this but the attacks that said I got something to my mother in law he's a good and if that's true that's a big deal now I don't know that we don't know that because we didn't get the paper\nThe only state but you never know what's yours all you got three hundred and\nOne opinions my God anyway I mean there was no there there's over a million pages a million pages of documents let me ask you something how long does it take you to read a two hundred page book\nHow are they going to go through a million documents I understand that will be their complaint from now until eternity but you bring up a a more interesting question to me which is\nAre they going to\nWatch the Democrats if they take control of the house will they go back and examine everything that happened in the past\nEvery administration when ... when you change the White House that that you get this all the time about we're going to go back and we're going to investigate Bill Clinton we're going to go back we're going to investigate George W. Bush were going to go back and it's always\nThey always broke and it never happens\nOkay that may be true you may be right about that I'm just saying watching what I stand up and listening to these every democratic senator they're not happy with it because they weren't given all the paperwork and I don't know what the\nPublic eye to about that well\nBut Janet you know they're the only you know that's a phony excuse though they all all immediately upon his\nBut they all ... all immediately upon his nomination should I'm opposed to him Ninety five percent of the senators\nKnew right away whether they were going to vote for him or against them because of their party\nIt had nothing to do all this others that don't get caught up in these ... uses\nAbout what we needed this we needed that we didn't get this chance we didn't get that answer I I Will it's just like a Lindsey Graham says why when I become German of the Judiciary Committee I'm going to go back there I'm going to investigate Dianne Feinstein and Mazie Hirono and all the others I I doubt it\nI I and I doubt that the Democrats when they take control of the house if they do\nThey're going to have their hands full with trying to get stuff done\nIn the future not going back to yesterday that's what usually happens they got to\nI work for a community organization I work for a network of community organizations I spent my entire adult life\nBuilding painful wear regular people can collectively act so that politicians intellect for my job I showed up to the capital with hundreds of people that ... organization other than ... ... so that we can tell her story that when I was talking to someone else like in that moment\nI was a woman I was a mother\nI was a survivor and I was someone who believes that we can collect and selections make better decisions for each other and the president wants to know whether I work for a special jak Haitian down there and that and I was in the nation from guy with the whole thing\nThat a lot will come on wedding with women across the country\nAre doing something about civility powerful sharing are starting to look that way I have been doing social justice for ... ... to ... to tell my story how long did it because I think we have an opportunity to be better\nOkay so she's got a nice story and uh she says you know where I'm a mother I'm a survivor um all the sort of stop and and that's why I needed to confront him well her organization she is I'm an immigrant from Columbia and she came here at the age of Seventeen with her mother\nAnd she has been working in a community organizer a ... in New York City she got a bachelor's degree and then she became a staff member of the Latin American integrations center in Queens and then she ...\nUm\nWhile her mother was the founding director of the Latin American innovation center so\nLatin American integration centered why do you think about when I say that you think immigration and that's what their focus has been\nAnd her mother and her aunt were former human rights lawyers in Colombia and they all moved here to the u._s. so her mother dies of cancer\nShe became the director of this organization she served in this role since two thousand three I've looked at this organization I've looked at what they do their background where they're opposites rather over in Staten Island now\nAnd her whole life and this organization has been dedicated to um immigrants and immigration rights that's what she does so for her to all of a sudden show up\nAbout um women and women's rights a is a different part of community organizing\nUm I ... but she didn't have any problems and you better believe I'm a I'm a a paid protester I get paid to do what I Do do you look at the center for popular democracy\nYou can find their IRS form for the Latin America integration center and this woman gets paid one hundred fifty six thousand dollars\nFrom just this one organization but apparently she's working for some others as well so she is not only a I'm a paid person to go do that sort of thing\nBut she gets paid a hundred and fifty six thousand just from this organization that her mother and aunt\nOriginally founded so um no I I I presume if you've been here since\nAlthough you since she was Seventeen I presume she says that isn't doesn't I I Can't\nFind out whether ah what her ... her status is but she is an immigrant but that's the whole thing is about immigrants and immigrant rights\nSo how this whole business about women's rights game up I I understand she's a woman I understand that somebody called her up and says look at I'm paying you a lot of money I Want you to get there and I want you to be do what you do but do it under the auspices of\nA your body for Christine Blasey Ford\nWho not only immigrant doesn't have any immigration issues so forget that once you to work on ... and you've got to it they basically were pulling out every car they could play\nFrom every organization that has ever done anything for any Democrat organization or any Democrat organizer that to do was get down to Washington DC and get to work done stopping this nomination\nSo I as much as I say it looks like Kevin I was going to be confirmed I'm Still holding my breath because they have spent a lot of money and a lot of effort\nAnd they got a lot of people in DC right now that are going to do everything they possibly can between now in tomorrow at four forty five eastern time to try and the rail this a nomination I I don't want to say it's over I Know what it looks like it is\n\nBut I'll
