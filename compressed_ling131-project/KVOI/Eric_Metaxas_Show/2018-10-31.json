kind of stuff and I want to make sure that we get to a you sent out a tweet today that was um\nAbout Donald Trump and I'm going to find it here and I'm going to I'm going to read it to my audience 'cause I thought it was interesting are you tracking cars I see we have technical them but what you can take those off and just listen to me okay so here's the here's a tweet that you sent out and I just I reach we did it and I thought we need to discuss this today\nAll of the mountains again [noise]\nBut I don't know who who that fight the famous\n... sort of scary I'm Talking to Jon rank and John ranking a first of all I Want to direct people to your website T. E. I. I. dot org T. E. I. I. dot org ... what do you have going on right now because we don't have a lot of time but I Want to make sure that people know what they can\nSay what have going on but to finish up with Donald Trump okay so what I'm we're never going to finish up with Donald Trump well we can for president purpose\nI doubt it but go ahead I dare you go ahead okay\nSo what happens is that I honor him as the president and and so and he is pursuing the good he comes to his works wrinkles at all and I know my words and wrinkles even more deeply okay so I talked about in our last a session\nAbout uh the curse on man to producers food by the sweat of his anger\nIs that if we don't know how to have that angry deemed in Jesus okay then we can still pursue the good but we're not going to get as much as good as possible so I I Would say that Donald Trump has done tremendous good in advancing religious political economic freedom is in his soul\nBut he started at a reactor point and I understand that I Know many react to point to my own life so the question is how do you move to the reactive actually been to the ... and this is my book we've talked about for Jesus in the face of the enemies and one simple idea in the garden of Eden you had the most radical idea and all of human history\nI everyone is free to choose between there are three polar opposites good and evil freedom and slavery life and death\nAnd were free to choose between the two and God that is yeah we give to inform choice of what each one is an invite the devil to be present which is to say there's this radical nature of a level playing field you can see it in the garden to eat and you can see it in Moses and Josh what you lied Jeremiah and Jesus in predicting right was enemies\nWhich always inviting those who disagree to the most in to your presence which you and I have experienced in several the Marshall forms over the right and so if\nThe president had the ability to structure something like that when you get the most\nImpassioned people who disagree with him to actually be on live television you know and moderator properly where ideas or listen to I discover\nI Would moderate that in a heartbeat yep\nAnd and and what happens is that when people know they're listening to venom goes out it goes down nine hundred not end well not quite sure I have two hundred and some forms of done over the years and all but two cases I've seen\nThe humanity of people disagree with me rise simply because I treated them with respect\nNow I think that the the the latest in the lobbying industry in the White House press corps are as hard as they come with the gospel wants to reach out to them and I think that if that were done in in a in a God the way I think the advance of what he's doing could be that much better and that's pro active in return to sense well\nIt's interesting of course I agree with you but I Want to I Want to be clear that when he talks about the fake news media and he says that to the enemy the American people I totally agree yeah the reason I agree I just want to say because every day I'm reminded of this I get the New York times delivered\nAnd right there on the front page I inevitably have proof\nThat they are not playing fair here's an example it's always above the fold so you can see it here it is it says this is now by the way of set us on the program before\nIt has a little bar it's as news analysis okay\nThat's the New York times phony way for ... whatever the heck they want but putting it on the front page votes opinion it's not news even though it's you know the the New York times supposed to be all news and it's ... percent opinion on the opinion page and I don't know they put their opinion on the front page most people would have no idea 'cause as news analysis\nThat it's not officially news and what does the headline above the fold it says\nCaravan rhetoric intersect with deadly hatred\nAnd then it says president stokes same fears that up here to drive attacks\nNow look at the ... history look what they what they have done here presidents stokes same fears\nThat appear to drive a tax so above the fold the New York times\nIs in this really cheeky way presenting the idea that well look what the president is done has ... done by even talking about the caravan a is driving murder of Jews\nLast Saturday That's what they said they have no proof it's nonsensical and not only do they not have proof but it's it's wrong even to suggest it it's a it's an ugly thing to do but they're pushing this because they don't feel that they have the arguments and they've got to effectively be nasty they're going to go low\nPrinting something like that above the fold is beneath the New York times the New York times never did this they can be liberal all day long but to do this\nIs to go low it's despicable and you can understand why this president is furious at\nThem so now let's get a theological proactive analysis so in genesis two as we just mentioned you have on us definition of terms this is life this is death this is freedom to slavery this is good this is evil\nWind surfing comes in with his anger I N genesis three uh and and the woman says we're not supposed to eat the fruit in Hebrew of of you always warning he said um if you eat the forbidden fruit in dying you continually die\nAnd I'm I Walk on the Hebrew but if that is draped in the ... the serpent says not indicting usual continually die or dying shall not continually die so the immediate lie the devil is to reverse reality\nTherefore when ever terms are properly and honestly defined\nTruth prospers and the gospel prosperous\nSo what we need to do is we need to find what is possible to get a genuine level playing field and you've moderated several ... Marshall formed abuse I pursue this for decades and it has not been easy for everyone I invite nine people say no among people who the logically a politically have a different opinion a\nTruth o was wants a level playing field so that would be the proactive now you talk about the lies and deceit sending Kong fake news fake news and when it comes to the media I I talk about the top down media okay because the media should be a medium or a ... a channel of news right top down media are people who\nInvest themselves in top down tyrannical a politics is really what it comes out they they want access to power to drop themselves through over other people so that's why I used top down media in top down media and dishonest media is the same territory now so you can say fake news and and that's an accurate definition terms\nBut how does that Jesus do during his debate with his enemies I didn't pass over a week he gives them all the space asked their toughest questions and only when they silence selves in public\nDoes he turned around in Matthew twenty three with the seven ... road to you a fair season ... seats hypocrites you walk over dead man's grades you you traverse land and sea to make a ... and you make them and that this was most damning sentence in the Bible you make them twice the sun it held that you are\nSo right there you have the contrast between the messiah\nThe seat of the woman and then his enemies who are the seed of the ... or ... of the devil so what happens is he doesn't accused him\nA ... and the and the son of God cannot be condemned by just said he doesn't accused them he's simply point out to them what they have already diagnosed themselves with\nThey've refused to ask them any more questions so what has to happen to be proactive back to back to my tweet this morning is it if you create a level playing field and it becomes possible and I pray it would be and you bring in the most concerted opponents in any context and with the president in this context and give them\nThe ability to know that when they leave they've been listening to you know it's going to happen the whole tenor of hate any animosity as you go down and some people will be redeemed and other people have less confidence to oppose\nThe truth well it's fascinating John because the reason I say I would moderate that is not just because I put myself forward a you know to do something with the president ... states but I I feel that\nYou need somebody and and you are obviously one of these people as well which is why you're here that we really want the truth even though you might hate somebody's point of view or this or that\nYou know as a Christian I'm commanded to love them I'm command it to pray for them um commanded to treat them as I Would wish to be treated and so it means that we can have\nAn honest debate I don't need to stack the deck I don't need to play those games I feel like even the conservative media\nOr wouldn't really be able to do that and it was I don't see even though I'm I'm a fan of of of many of the host on things like Fox News I think to do what we're talking about\nTake somebody um who is particularly dedicated to what you're saying\nAnd do you know what the differences is if we are looking for gotcha moments were stuck oh gosh I'm old\nNow that's how well that is how the guy just stuff ... I see it every night on TV makes me sick\nWhat we want or the aha moments and you can never predict them\nThey only happened in on this conversation when people know they are respected enter loved and and and then bring that into politics is the most radical idea there is I've been working for forty years\nAnd so the resistance to it it it's phenomenal because people have their paychecks her identity and their ... you know their personhood all wrapped up into it\nFor free is ... is defending people uh who who are having their religious liberty attack but when they do that\nFor free or first of all they need your support but when they do that for free keep in mind you're not just defending those people there defending something\nWhich is yours and mine there helping us keep the republic if you can keep it how do you keep it you have to fight the evil you have to fight these kinds of attacks if you don't do it it goes away so go to a tax us talk\nDot com attacks has talked dot com you see the banner alliance defending freedom whatever you give will be doubled this is the week please thank you [noise]\nHelp and I want to tell you about relief ... or ...

around I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about ah what you just are teased in the previous segment this this initiative to end abortion in America\nWell that's not quite what I said but I think we can shut down um through informed choice perhaps half the abortion industry\nUh and and so in our prior segments we're talking about my passion for biblical theology one oh one in all the good thinking we have to do if we do a good local thinking we can arrive the strategies that are so well informed they will succeed\nSo what I did in Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen Ninety One or in uh Boston, Massachusetts was in front of the biggest abortion center in New England uh which was um a\n[noise] a pre term at the time bought up by Planned Parenthood later in two years where the Saturday mornings and we had over that time hundreds of volunteers the Boston chapter of the national organization for women had hundreds of volunteers\nAnd we saw at least two hundred women if their own choice walk away from the abortion appointments sidewalk houses where they're doing their work even more deeply than that but we also had in the first nine months um all these college recruits from the national organization for women\nAnd we engage them in conversation and such a way that after nine months they quote stop sending their recruits down any more because we were persuading too many of them\nAnd so this is the power of thinking so ah and other priorities in life and and whatnot and finally back to a place where we are ready to start a a number of ... but but the first one is what we called teams of seven dot org\nOr and so if if people who are listening goaded teams are seven dot org they can read the little bit of introductory element\nBut then they will see the six science to have one in five of the others\nThat we hold in front of political gatherings at which we plan to do quite soon right in New England and in front of abortions centers and what the science have the power to do is stop people in their tracks and get them to think we dumped of leading a proactive sense\nSo the first sign is a a white letters on on green and it says you have the power to choose life now\nWhen I was at Harvard late eighties and and and finishing up there the feminist language where you have the power to choose\nI then the pro life plan would was choose life\nThat choose life is good but it doesn't work in front of an abortion clinic in my mind because it's in the imperative tense women are being pushed into their abortions and if you say choose life that's good content but if in the ...\nAnd they may feel pushed her bullied or something like that even the slightest telling them what to do\nEven the slightest bit but when you come up with the language you have the power to choose life is the gospel is a gift language so after our second time down there Nineteen eighty nine when there were hundreds of people out there on on the second time they were down there ah I overheard one you\nKnow W. recruit speak to one of their lieutenant or leaders and saying how do we answered them when they say you have the power to choose life right and the N O W leader said oh that's their language we don't use it anymore\nSo what happened was we read deemed the language of choice to serve life none of us can choose less were first alive to begin with\nAnd last night talking in in ... and ... and it costs of teaching talk with a woman who was post supportive and has been through all the crap years ago she said she's seen a sign like that when she's been pushing to abortion she would've stopped\nBecause everyone was telling her you don't have the power to choose life and the way to become a power just to have the abortion and get on with your life that's not true so this sign is is the gospel this is the entire pro\nAs you have the power to choose you life life and so and so we manufacture these um\nThat was going to say ...

me and I couldn't be prouder now if that were to wind up in the handle someday would just be the sweetest thing in the world you know that's something I did later in life was correlate with the very first thing that I ever heard was something out of him and I I Know that song is\nHis powerful um I I did had no intention of being any of that you know all it was intended for which for me to grieve my brother's death and honor him and and and celebrate what I thought was in store for him\nAnd what really didn't even plan to record it\nAnd Tony brown\nSaid you have to record this awesome okay if you want to and and and then they told me they were going to put it as a single and I said well you guys have lost her mind [laughter] I couldn't have been more wrong but um I I\nI really could not be prouder that that I was lucky enough to to to strike a chord with people that\nThat they want to go to that song\nHinder grave us times and and their most painful and hurtful and and sad times they go to that song to find comfort Maya Angelou um\nThey go to that song if I come from Maya Angelou um [noise] got in touch with me and told me that that song uh was\nAn amazing a healing process for her when she lost her products or I feel pretty blessed to lucky and all those things to have gotten to write that one\nAnd Mary Catherine our oldest daughter her husband Tim [noise]\nSo America until moved in with us\nAnd they had two daughters quickly when he was\nFour at the time and Mariah who's about one\nSo they lived with us while they were looking for a house then they found a house but it was a fixer upper so they were going through fixing it up so they ended up living with us for nine months and during that time of course we got to see Mariah lately every day in\nThe rye went for the rug rats are courting flour to toddler\nShe was a real joy as a kid when there was a party of some kind of she was laps or Stephen ... mapped out based on whatever food was in front of a say we've ever had the best goodies that's whose lap she might be a [noise]\nObviously you're always attached to your grandkids but this was more like\nArchaea [noise]\nMoran had some fever induced seizures which means to get a low grade fever and didn't have a seizure [noise]\nSo we got six kids five of them there and the oil business with us\nBut David Was be to his own job he's almost just like me which means we but it has all but growing up so um\nI remember one is a junior he was like you you know you're controlling you don't give me any freedom and I said here's what freedom is you pay the rent you pay the car payment you pay your own insurance and you will be free and Eighteen months and I can't wait and I saw his eyes get as big as saucers we never had any more problems [laughter] [noise]\nSo David when he got an engineering degree\nAnd so his brother's really leaning on him to come back to us we needed help really bad but he decided he's going to be a musician and he said I just don't want to look back and wonder what I\nCould have done so he gave himself two years and that was about ten years ago now one of his songs just won an award for a song or a year and Christian music SALT I want to go back [noise]\nI Wish all\nAcross the ocean [noise]\n\n[noise] and that was me I had the same town\n\nAnd then I got a nice guy\nDavid is in Nashville and he's he's the only one is not with us if you can't really not into middling for about nine months\nBut he had a an event\nThat he was booked for so he was in town\nAnd he had a song on the radio at that time was first song to play on the radio\nAnd it's a song about perspective and here's where the song came from\nIt came from our family all been at Disneyland our family likes to take the trips together we discovered that will pay everybody come so [laughter] we were at Disneyland or Disney World and leave kids at the time we're about foreign to think Brady an addict\nSo Addy was pushing the empty stroller and bright he wanted to push that she wrote an eddy wouldn't let him and so bright he just had a complete meltdown there was a lot of laughing about that here we are at Disneyland happiest place on earth\nGot all these rides around you and here's this kid melting down because I Can't push a stroke or something you can do anywhere on earth\nAnd David in particular I thought\nYou know we can't do that if she were were in a Disneyland really amazing opportunities we have in life\nAnd were melting down because of the bumper sticker on the car in front of us that we kinda do this to ourselves so if we can lift your eyes and see it in a different light you'll realize everything's beautiful that's the core of the song so he came to town and Mariah and particularly really loved the song\nAnd she couldn't speak well enough to sing the whole thing but\nThe course go something like that [noise]\nThat's how it goes so she would say a lie sky she would just do that one tag word on and and she called him on some days she couldn't Dave Dave so today's so every time the song\nCame on the radio she wouldn't uncle days and she would sing along to uncle day was big favorite then of course he's the only out of town uncle such big five so he came to town so we went over to Becky ... Kevin was at her sister's house with morale\nAnd may captain was holding Iran and David said hey mirage ride was just not feeling a lot of the day she was had a really like right fever and so she just didn't feel too good so we said okay well you know she will go let her take a nap\nAnd and then we'll see like\nLots of days and we had a new office building at the time and I took him to come to an office and I got a call from Terry [noise] that was a you know you gotta come home right now [noise]\nRise not responsive so we flipped around and went home on our lives that the ambulance we asked was more I've gone to the hospital\nAnd Terry had been outside gone for a walk and America was kind of\nKeep an eye on Iraq has these fever and do seizures so she went and looked in ... so she screamed\nCarrying just gotten back she went in immediately did CPR they called up the empties there were there in five minutes to really that caught it and plenty of time they got her color back [noise] but [noise]\nWe learned later that about Ninety percent of the time with the little kids that can't start their hearts and that was it they just couldn't restart heart\nSo she's in an apt she was perfectly fine [noise]\nShe just died\nSo here we all are and you know you have this image tragedy I knew that when ... kids that the divorce rate's pretty high so I immediately called our pastor and said hey\nWe need help because I I don't want to see our family breakup or see people you know families within our family breakup he said well we'll just bringing in this program called grief share which I recommend it helped our family eventually but here's the bottom line [noise]\nIf you grieve together\nAnd you understand the way other people want agrees and you agree with them the way they want a grave you hurt more faster but the event will bring you together\nBut the human tendency\nIs to not want to have pain so when the pain comes and it's your day degrees but not the other person's day what tends to happen is the other person will withdraw because they don't want to feel their pain\nSo you get a little further apart and then tomorrow it's their degrees and you're okay that day so you withdraw\nAnd people just drift apart\nBecause they wouldn't have together\n[noise] and this is the way a personalized I'm an oil and gas investor to understand investment if you invest in other people's pain and agrees with them the way they want to graze\nYou're investing in what's left which is the Russian ship you still have\nSo what that looked like for me as every time for me for months after I every time I saw somebody they wanted to talk about ... ... and they wanted to grieve with me\nYou know it's a great for them to know from my standpoint I didn't really want to grieve anymore you know I grieved enough but you know what because of that perspective that my past I was able to say I want a grave with first\nBecause I'm investing in this relationship this is what remains see\nAnd when we continue for the story of Tim done Mariah and so much more about life\nAnd living from this terrific\nTim done the story his family's story\nHere on our American story
