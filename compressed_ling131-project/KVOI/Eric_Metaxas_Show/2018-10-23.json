New Jersey where he bought a little two acres back what it was far away and the New Jersey is the Garden State so I grow up in a small town\nAnd Jersey ... when I was from what I was ... young for when I was older it just changed in fundamental ways\nAnd I went to University of Virginia law school and I was the first time I was in the south and then a friend of mine took me to Oxford who had gone to a whole mess and I said this may be one of the most beautiful towns in America I may one day have a family here and I do\nIt's a gamble now by the way does your wife know about this actually\nShe's in Mississippi and so she knew\nOh you mean you have a family there with you with your wife because sometimes I Do I\nCall my well my wife grew up in Biloxi I literally in the area I think um but she ... the virtues of small town\nAnd I was just concerned you one of those people that you know you were living to live your living a lie basically and I thought he got family in Oxford, Mississippi and his wife doesn't know about it if she hears about it on this program ... cook so you're telling me that you only have one white one family thank God okay well\n... as much as I remember\nAs much as you know at least he usually when you mentioned it's so funny when you think about\nSicily and then you mentioned Oxford, Mississippi I Can't think of two worlds in my mind that are more different and I think of William Faulkner and when I think of Sicily it's just like you know ... and yet\nUh I get what you're saying it's very interesting ... at ...

American taxes and my guess is Lee Habib ... be\nA welcome back you I'm a ... you you wear a lot of hats you you are and it's not just because you don't have hair okay because that's a ... that you put on you one of these people you shave that nobody knows how much you know you really have\nBut you were a lot of hats metaphorically speaking because you are you're just one of those people you do a lot of different things\nOr your essay on radio network executive of course this program comes to you couldn't see the Salem Radio network or you're the host of our American stories you do a lot of writing\nA we're talking about one of the stories that you wrote I don't know where does it appear where ... where did the story in Chicago\nNewsweek I Do a weekly story for Newsweek now weekly podcast okay every week you're going to get an original American story\nBut you're not going to get anywhere else and uh every week on every Monday one drop\nOkay so you are you were talking about the great Chicago recovery many of us heard of the great Chicago fire making Seventy one Mrs ... cows knocks over lantern uh that's the that's the legend and ... I mean this this city was three hundred thousand\nPeople and you're you're saying a third of the city was Don overnight and\nSeventeen thousand bit build buildings burned to the ground three point five square miles burned to the ground and a hundred thousand people are homeless\nAnd again there was no help and so what does the city to what's interesting is the city is that the embers are still firing up and this is just finally they ran out of the fire ran out of fuel that's white and she said nothing left for\nA show for the city but the biggest Reverend in town river Robert call your calls the folks around this large prayer service says this\nWe're not lost first or geography nature called the lakes the farmers the primaries together in ... well before we were born and they decided on this spot a great city would be built\nAnd then of course the bankers hurt that they went to work writing letters credit to investment bankers around the country\nTo St Louis to Cincinnati to New York to Philadelphia saying something simple lend us money we'll pay you back\nWhere the people to Chicago and we're going for it there were there were no federal aid there was something much better coming in human kept kept going through human beings who promised to pay it back\nAnd what happened the building starch quickly it\nStarts so quickly that within three years the city is practically rebuilt and Thirty years later\nThe city it passes a million and mark and becomes the fastest growing city not only in in America but in the world and it just shows you that you and I both know New York well when nine eleven happened or nothing set and be more\nThan having it take Fifteen Years to build\nI mean take Fifteen Years to build just a building\nIn the strangest thing in the world I mean I have to say I in my lifetime I've never been impressed by by anything so when things don't happen quickly I just go well what's what's new but when you think\nThat the Empire State building which has not moved a millimeter or since it was put up in Nineteen thirty one that building was put up in Seventeen months you believe that you cannot believe you know why that\nIs right I mean between the litigation lawyers the insurance bite the environment was the activists older people saying how it should be built that we shouldn't be built but property rights have been ... in this country\nYou as a fact of property rights have been eroded and they had on on top of that the overlay of of cell that lack of self help and self reliance is towards the end of this call somebody asked me leave what made it possible and I said well optimism ...\nCharacter and that he said it would mean western belief itself alive and capitalism itself I mean people believes in capitalism they believed\nThat you can go get that credit credit is nothing but an extended police to trust in another human being that they'll pay you back right and they didn't see the people who invested in Chicago got a terrific return on their investment terrific well\nYou you think about it at all none of this is possible if you have\nHeavy regulation and Henry ... heavy taxation in other words it's one thing to believe in these things is another thing to be able to execute so that was a time in this country when you didn't have the kind of regulation we have today and listen to some good things about some regulation but obviously\nA regulation can can squash\nA incentives and uh you know the entrepreneurial spirit that can do spirit so it is interesting to think what was possible at that time to pull off then and then I found out he owed\nOut you know I I Want to give you an insight about President Trump because I was talking to somebody the other day about this when I was doing or anger show and I went to law school at war and we started a national show together and it became a really big one\nAnd why would or why we're doing that show we wanted to be a cultural show every Monday we had a guy named Donald Trump well that's because he hosted the number one show with television called the practice we did not one of these notes we did not want to be one of those conservatives who says oh the American people have such Bush what taste\nSo we started watching The Apprentice and it was a great show what made it clear that Donald Trump always fire at the right people [laughter]\nIt would look at two groups competing to do an enterprise and then someone would have to get fired\nOr Trump Trump he asked some questions and then he went that you're fired\nAnd people want them to fire the right people in fact I think across America everybody was watching why don't I have a boss who fires lazy but next to me so I can make money she sat guys that do anything I'm doing his job and I'm getting paid less because of the shuttle comes just sheer oh\nI get to do something very few people done\nI said it trumpeted by just one of his building\nA war we see that day when I went and watched Trump\nWork building which at the time it was somewhere in the west side he was really something like sixty sixty stories and they had all these workers at all if Trump was walk through all that nonsense it here to put up from city planners from the people from the mobsters with their concrete from the Democrat from the Republicans which I got to pay everybody off\nThe ... there's this\nMy buildings which I could have sold each of these apartments but three hundred thousand they now costs six hundred thousand and you know what all these students and people are taken three hundred thousand dollars him off the whole enterprise so I think Trump developed his toughness and its sense of America\nFrom have any real tall buildings and one of the hardest places in the world to build a tall building\nIsn't anywhere near that thing that that is really a interesting because\nIt is fascinating then he comes out of New York which of course um he's guilty of you know all this stuff that that we we think is bad right I mean big government a bloated bureaucracy New York's miss the center of the world on that I mean we had a reprieve under Giuliani a little bit\nBut basically ... under the new mayor\nOr the Blasio we're we're we're we're getting dragged back\nInto that there are street people everywhere beggars in the subways are on the subway platforms everywhere you go\nAh that's going on and so yeah Trump\nReally made his bones so to speak at ... in New York so it is fascinating to me that and then he understood why it's bad just because he was here which actually brings us to Chicago I mean here we are talking about the rebirth of Chicago after the Eighteen Seventy one fire and it's really a absolutely a\nA a testament to entrepreneur entrepreneurship or to the American spirit\nOr to to the American can do attitude\nAnd yet Chicago today is you know one of the worst cities in America from for many reasons I mean there are many wonderful things about Chicago but it is really struggling right now I mean there's a tremendous irony there and it's very sad\nIt is and it got captured by Republican for a pension unions right so that debt which no one can repay has nothing to do with the American ... character it has to do with rewriting graft\nAnd extortion right and so what what got lost over time mobsters always do whether they work for the government or for the mob\nIs they're always looking to particularly cities where they can capture free rent right and they can capture it through unions through public employee pension your news like this this is Chicago's problem and one day it will be able to pay the bills it's also New Jersey's problem it's also California's problem and\nThe joy to salvage we don't have a strong public employee pension union so we don't have great state that states can't print money so here's a British I'll make it'll make your audience happy the red states are going to get lots of people moving Joe and the blue states are going to empty out and federalism will save the country\nGosh my hat off to you lead for for for bringing this to our attention where can we find this story if we want to find this\nOr this or just go to a live even Newsweek and typing Aretha Franklin on a Google Search\nThis all come right and it became their top column of the of the month\nOf because you know I I wasn't taking your position you know what I simply did was show that the pastor's entire speech I mean I ... most of it and it's in the piece where am I the way when you read it you know it isn't just picking on African Americans his age with America what kind of a country that's out of wedlock birth rate a forty percent\nWhen when we come back I'm going to talking about what I Want
