then I turned to crack cocaine and a two thousand and um I invented the pill and two thousand four and quit everything overnight January sixteen two thousand nine\nSo there was a stretch there but one of the things when I did sell the pillow I was turned on everywhere at home shows in fares made a table in front of me I have this terrible fear of rejection so I couldn't I was very shy and couldn't talk and and that's why he was always use these drugs well\nThey um I find a table in front of me I could actually talk to people and move on from there I needed my drugs you know and they are short

he can make something beautiful letter that right and that's your story I mean when you were a ... in such a mess now people want to know and I always want to ask you because I find it funny one who was driving you\nTo invent a new pillow you don't find that funny 'cause you you lived this right most people don't know the story\nRight well you know I had problems with pills going plowed and using my arm and headaches and mix all these and I tried to repeal alter obey all the way back to I was sixteen that's kind of strange but that was my calling and I actually had dreams up in the minds weren't popular there was no minds and the dream dream so and I know we're right from God my pillow and then\nAnd uh and then I kept getting ... took about a year to invent over a year he can't make this stuff I\nMean really you cannot make this\nAnd when you talk about um you know once I did get an invention I was turned down everywhere I mean I was ... you know it was a complete shut out and then someone said well why don't you do a key as such a pretty a spell out you know\nAnd I did this chaos but I couldn't do the ... and when he was there one day because my wife at the time was doing the kiosk because I couldn't talk to people I mean and ah you know I was very she you know didn't have that table in front of me when I you know\nSo so for some reason when there was a table in front of us felt uninhibited kind of hard it was in uh\nWhen there was a table in front of us felt uninhibited kind of\nHard it was an agenda people come up and I could tell them about the pillow and tell them I ... it was and even when we did the first one I could everything overnight Godfrey me of the addictions but I still wasn't walking when Jesus I mean this was January sixteen two thousand nine
