perseverance and of course they've been successful because they wrote and all the way\nSo let me tell you a little bit about these awards the first awarded for three years in happens we'll\nAnd we went in for the twenty a week old trip sound and essentially we just thought we were going to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and we learned at that ultrasound that we're going to have a boy so we went out we buy clothes and just different things for him\n[noise] been about two weeks later we had gone out of town and our obey doctor had been out of town to so when we went in for the ultrasound we are we're just with fame ultrasound technician\nWe received a call from our doctor\nAnd he says that\nThe ultrasound showed that David our son did not have kidney is\nMy first thought was okay how can we fix that and\nOur doctor several you need to go and see appearing ecologist specialists to see if you know ... to for him to look at it further when we went to the doctor and he\nChecked everything out and confirmed that our son did not have kidney and what we learned was that kid needs help actually produce the lungs or develop the lungs because basically the baby will drink the em the Arctic fluid and then they'll get out and drink and\nNot actually develop the lungs and so the issue wasn't necessarily is lack of kidneys the but the fact that his lungs but not develop\nWe were told that we you know that he would probably come middle married thirty weeks that station and so\nI'm just continue the pregnancy and I'll just try to enjoy every moment that we that we had with him just died sometimes he wouldn't move he couldn't move a\nLot because there was no fluid by we would just to play music for him at night and it\nJust tried to spend whatever time we could with him [noise] about\nUh thirty four weeks in the pregnancy I started having contractions and went into labor and so we went to the hospital to deliver David now this whole this whole time you know I\nAt that point it has been a couple of months that we knew that David without live I also learned about an organization called now I'd lay me down to sleep\nIn that organization provides remembrance portraits two parents suffering the death of a baby when a friend first told me about it I was a little hesitant I thought\nIs that appropriate me taking pictures of a baby in the situation but I went to the website and I saw how beautiful photographs were and I realized that we would never have this opportunity again\nTo be able to photograph our son and so I decided you have the photographs of our son\nSo when we went in to deliver David out his heart was still feeding and when it was time for me to to push the hold the heart monitor off on them because they knew that you could possibly die during the delivery process so they took to hurt monitor off\nAnd the thing I was hoping for the most was that he will be born alive and\nSo when he was born it they he did not have a heart heartbeat he was not breathing and they handed to him to\nMe and I was I was so crushed that our son was important alive but then at the same time I remember looking at him and thinking\nWow this baby was in his beautiful and just like any first time mom would feel about a baby there their first baby just how beautiful and I cannot believe that I was carrying the baby but then the reality struck again that he was not alive [noise]\nWe we spent some time with him and then our photographer came in and she photographed David and just\nYou know documenting our time with him we gave him a bath we helped him she weighed him a we have pictures of him on the scale of each of us holding him of us of the family of him alone and ah we you know we just cherish those moments that we\nHad with him about six hours after she was born we just we knew it was time that we needed to let him go and it was one of the hardest things I ever did too I give him over to a nurse and know that I Would never hold him again [noise]\nSo at that at that point he you know I was being discharged from the hospital and we now needed to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time we were able to see some of those things through there's\nMany many other families who who's a baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare but we knew were we were we would bury him and\nSo I remember going home that night and trying to go to bed but then I realized where where is\nDavid as you get the hospitals funeral home pick 'em up and I called the nurse at the hospital she was back on her shift again and she assured me that he was still there and I was just\nWanting to know where my baby was so we went a so a few days later we had a memorial service and we buried our Sunday then\nWe were told that we could go on and\nHave other children that this was a fluke occurrence and I have seen online other stories with babies who had uh what what it's called ... syndrome a whereas if the parents go on and have healthy children and his chromosomes ... turned up okay and all the other tests for fines so we were\nClear to have another baby and we got pregnant a couple of months later\nWe we're cautiously optimistic and um we went in for a number of ultrasound so I was still considered an ... a high risk pregnancy because of our situation\nBut we still would need to wait until the sixteen week ultrasound to see if our baby had kidneys [noise]\nSo the sixteen ... found we went in and the doctor within their with ultrasound condition and I'm laying there\nAnd he just pause and he said wait a minute let me step in and so he stepped in for the ultrasound technician and he was looking and I kept asking what what's wrong what's going on and he wouldn't tell us they just kept looking and I said does he have kidneys and he said he does\nAnd I said they'll kids in what's what's going on because we knew something had to have been wrong\nHe had a U.S go into another room and my husband and I just we waited for the seemed like forever and then the doctor came in and you said\nYour baby has as just around the neck and severe fluid buildup in what we later learned was\nThat it just to ... that hydra Hydrox was a fluid and following around all of his Oregon [noise]\nThen at that point they were unsure of the gender of our baby because of all the spelling\nAnd then the doctor said that his heart to stop beating at any time\nAnd so um\nHe said she can't move and I didn't show him move at all that I\nNeed to come in every week to see if his heart is still beating every week we went in and I started getting more hope because I thought maybe this\nIs our miracle maybe this is what we have to go through to have\nTo have our miracle and and nothing has ever been too easy for me throughout my life so I thought maybe this is a miracle every week we went in and then by twenty four weeks since the pregnancy [noise]\nWe learn that are babies' heart stopped and so the doctor said you can you know you can still carry the baby for a while and you'll probably going to natural labor or if you don't buy a certain period of time I can't remember how long that was\nThen we would have to induce or you can go ahead and do and I looked at him I said what am I supposed to do if I'm Still carrying him and knowing that he's died so my husband and I went to the hospital that night and they induce labor [noise] and we had a little boy that we named Ethan\nAnd I had a camera in my bag [noise] and I remember thinking you know let's get some pictures because when his when he was\nHis condition was extremely severe a lot of the teachers were not identifiable he gets his hands on his feet [noise] but the ... song it was pretty severe and I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring\nYou live here and I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring now lay me down to about two and I remember thinking about the camera in my bag that may be with him covered in a blanket\nAnd my husband and I holding him we get to have a picture of him but I just didn't have the courage to it and I didn't have any one encouraging me to say you know go ahead and take some pictures and um so we never photograph the than the and that's one of the biggest regrets in my life\nAnd one of the story Gina's story\nOr more of it after these messages here on

our babies but before we had RJ we're also grieving the fact that we may never raise children are older and at least that part has been answered for us and we've chosen not to have any more children we just\nDon't know how we would handle it if something happened and it's just not worth the risk or one for five at this point and so that's why we're we're sticking with ours they now but I think
