and Dennis Prager and are are probably some Fox shows I Hope I'll be doing Fox and friends we'll see but um it it'll be an interesting week next week to see how you kind of what happens\nAnd it was actually the show\nAnd I think what's even more exciting than the bass player playing bass for Kansas\nHow about my friend my window in the studio Mike welcome you just look you put a smile on my face or one of these people in case people don't know who you are you at the inventor\nOf my pillow and I don't mean the pillow that I use I mean my pillow dot com people\nHave seen ads for this and the maniac entrepreneur behind it that is you that as you your story so crazy I've I've interviewed you onstage my a lot of my listeners know the story but for people are just tuning who don't know your story you say who's that guy\n... it's going to have to be the short version just because there's so much like these let let's start here you invented this\nPillow while you were addicted to correct to crack cocaine you know\nI was a cocaine addict for years and then I turned to crack cocaine and a two thousand and and um I invented the pill in two thousand four and quit everything overnight January sixteen two thousand nine so there was a stretch there but one of the things when I did sell the pillow I was turned on everywhere at home chosen fares\nWhen I get a table in front of me I had this terrible fear of rejection strike when I was very shy and couldn't talk and and that's why he was always use these drugs while\nThey um I find a table in front of me I could actually talk to people in a a move on from there I needed my drugs you know and they are so it was never broke promises back to him with a you know I lost a mirror twenty year marriage and stop people tried to take the company and all those dysfunction a drug dealers during intervention I'm\nOK Now this is this story it's so funny because it's so delightful because you're so transparent about these struggles and people see God's hand in your life kind of amazing 'cause I think a lot of times people think like you had a straight up and fly right\nAnd you realize you know that's not what the message of the gospel is the gospel is except Jesus and whatever Matthew are he can make something beautiful letter that right and that's your story I mean to you and you were a in such a mess now people want to know and I always want to ask because I find it funny one who was driving you\nTo invent a new pillow you don't find is funny because even though you lived this way most people don't know the story\nRight well you know I had problems with pills going cloud and using my arm and headaches and their kicks all these and I try to repeal alter obey all the way back to I was sixteen that's kind of strange but that was my calling and I actually had dreams of the ... minds were popular there was no minds and I've been trained my dreams and I know we're right from God to my pillow and then\nAnd uh and then I kept getting ... took about a year to bend over a year\nHe can't make this stuff are not really you cannot make this\nAnd when you talk about um you know once I did get an inventor that was turned down everywhere I mean I was ... you know it was a complete shut out and some of the civil Mike why don't you do a Q A session spell out\nYou know and I did this chaos but I couldn't do the chaos and when he was there one day because my wife at the time was doing the kiosk because I couldn't talk to people I mean and ah you know I was very she you know didn't have that table in front of me when I don't\n... so so for some reason when there was a table in front of you felt uninhibited kind of ...\nThere was an agenda people come up and I could tell them about the pillow until my home ... and even when we did the first one I could everything overnight Godfrey me of the addiction but I still wasn't walking when Jesus I mean this was January sixty two thousand nine\nAnd but I still wasn't walking when Jesus I mean this was January sixty two thousand nine right now I started getting things started happening getting the company back everything was taken by these other guys and\nAnd I ended up the night before I did my first M for murder shy so you know what I'm going to do it in from a trip nobody will take me I'm gonna bring it right to the people what my friends family pulled and I had to stream we're going to be the biggest in history and and on the night before we film is\nThe producer the one of the producers came out and he checks the other guy said this guy we're doing our ... is the worst I've ever seen is never going to make it on to this is going to be a disaster\nThat guy was obviously obviously a prophet of God or a false prophet who should be taken outside of camping stoned [laughter] ... that's ... that's the rule you got to do it what kind of their pay so so it turns out you weren't actually the worst infomercial guy you're one of the best in his\nArea we went from my ... year in October seventh two thousand eleven I was living in my sister's basement three in the morning and an ear and I had like five or ten employees my kids are myself a few others forty days later we had five hundred employees\nOkay it was just so that Florida I well I I guess the reason I laugh is because you're so naturally exuberant but you know the idea that somebody would say like I've got to invent the pillow this was really a thing for you know by the way if people go to my pillow dot com and they put in the er the code Eric\nOr my tax is uh my program gets credit for it so if you're listening for example to the Mike Gallagher show and you say I Want to order my pillow be sure you put an Eric Irma taxes because Gallagher is getting rich off these pillows and I don't like it how many yell at herring but so seriously you felt this compulsion to invent the pillow\nAnd what what is that even mean in other words you\nKnow what I told a let me let me just uh I'll tell ya where what I Know what is now I'm you know not only self forty three million people whose sole forty three million now but the\nI kept telling people even back when I was still on drugs that are a pillow was just a platform for a much bigger purpose or none bigger calling and when those drug dealers to them intervention on me and I couldn't buy drugs was two thirty in the morning I came back up and when I'm sitting there and he goes\nHe goes you know give me that phone I've been up for fourteen days he says give me your phone I'm taking a picture says you've been telling us this pill is just a platform for God and you're going to come back and help us all someday and we're not going to let you die on us and\nOkay and I'm On my mind like like but I mean people aren't tracking you listen but I just want to make sure people can enjoy what you're saying you were telling me\nThat drug dealers drug dealers decided\nNot to sell you drugs they banned it together because even these drug dealers saw something in your life and they actually said we're not going to let you ruin your life drug dealer absolutely and they made an intervention for drug dealers yeah\nThree to three of them didn't have any control the whole streets I mean no drugs yeah I went down there I couldn't buy drugs in where I went out almost a half a mile\nDo you understand how the whole area this is what do you understand how hilarious is they put the word out on the street do not sell drugs to Mike when we don't want his money we actually care about his life that's and then what one of the deal is one of yours is\nA born again Christian works for me and they interviewed him the other days longer dealer knowing Miller I just want to be clear by his they've all they've all got quit now and they but he they interviewed and they said how did you control the street she says we went down there and set up you see some crazy white guy with a moustache you don't sell them okay\n[laughter] I Know this is not the neighborhood where there was a lot of crazy white guys with ... Illinois only only clean shaven white guys right and and if you had a mustache probably person of color but you are the only white guy got mugged Ashville and they have a we were not getting drugs you are not getting\nDrugs getting drugs and they and you know Eric that one of the stories of people don't know is I\nI actually in two thousand fourteen we were in two days of going under my pillow I mean there was we you know I ... I had even though I got it for free and many of these the desire for the drugs I still didn't have a relationship with Jesus\nAnd that that that happened in our I'm actually February Eighteenth of two thousand Seventeen\nWhere I actually surrendered and now I can go out in that span ah have more passion for Jesus than I did a pillow\nAnd I just spoke at fifty thousand feet for us being stadium where the super bowl was\nSprayed with them and for my story there and it was a surreal like two weeks later I my ... granddaughter my niece and nephew wherever valley fair and all these millennials were coming up while your testimony was just amazing and all this uh finally my grand or ... much he goes he's my grandpa and we got to go on rides\nAnd none of about this stuff I Want to go in the right way you think I'm here right now um but I mean I I just want to say the idea that these drug dealers saw something in you that because you know what look\nFor those of us who have not been drug addicts or have not been in that world we tend to think of people especially drug dealers\nLike the cartoon bad guys you're telling me no these are human beings and even in the midst of their sin they saw something beautiful in your life and they they didn't want it to get ruined and you're telling me that\nYou had told them\nThat you would help them and they said we don't want you to screw up we want you to succeed so you can help us write\nRight there was I was their home and there were ... they tell me this now I was there hold back then and there were many times Eric where\nI Would be you know you START I own a bar I mean owned bars that was what about place for an addict but these small bars that I you know there's always an entrepreneur what I Would talk to addicts you know we'd be out there doing our drugs in the interview after hours after the bar closed and\nI wouldn't be talking about the Bible and stuff that I read about when I was in jail and the and the end times that they would quit that day find she's a cycle what did I say\nAt twenty people that I can count have told their stories my ... I was I was on but it was me always trying to convince myself you know\nAnd it was very prophetic that they are then it was they're hoping there and uh\nI look back now I'm going wow that was just trying to always convince myself where you're talking through it and telling these guys this and I'm going I kept saying what did I say that's got to be my\nI think there's a there's a whole lot of non addicts out there who wish that they had that gift that is truly amazing that here you are just going on and on and these people's lives get changed by you while you're a smile on right in the middle you're saying\nThat most people say well what a hypocrite but then when they when that was not the case in a you know so for me I knew early on that the pillow was a just a platform for a much bigger purpose you know for God's purposes well ... platform that I'm On now that system\nAnd there's been a couple of times I remember the first time we saying God Bless America or something I got
