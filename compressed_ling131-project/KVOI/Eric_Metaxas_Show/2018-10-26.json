when they educate the students because they don't take a penny a federal funds right which is a wild concept but it's like almost no colleges are able to do that they've got an endowment so they are genuinely free to teach about\nAmerican style self government and liberty they they teach you about American exceptionalism they teach their kids with the constitution means all this stuff\nThat not only is not being taught in many colleges today most colleges I'm afraid to say but it's actively being taught against Hillsdale their champions in this there's very few very few colleges\nUm that uh that understand these issues and teach\nThese issues to their students but the reason we have a website set up my taxes for Hillsdale dot com is that they want\nTo teach these things to the whole

but I'm getting really excited because\nA man sharp we've had him on the program before a ... I wanted to get him on again but this time with his client a man who is now a effectively famous in the world of religious liberty\nJak Philips a the owner of masterpiece cake shop in Colorado I have them both on the line thrilled to have you both on the line gentlemen welcome to the program\nHow welcoming glad to be here they Travis\nYeah I I gotta say a ... thanks to both of you met your there too right yes I Am yeah well listen uh ... this program I Am I my audience knows that we're doing a a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom because you guys do everything you do for free and everything is at stake but I'm really excited\nUm to have both of you on but there's a lotta times you know somebody like you ... your name your out there people don't understand you were real guy just like everybody else you're a small business owner you were a normal person I have met you and you know and we forget that what is happening in America\nThat to people who have basic biblical values\nIs crazy it's absolutely crazy it's happening the folks like you and talked to you\nAnd so I Want to talk about uh the Supreme Court victory and I want to talk about the more recent trouble are that are that we've had so maybe I'm jak you could just describe if you would of what happened way back when when this couple came into your\nInto your shop and asked you to bake a cake\nTo create something not just to to sell a cake but to create something nice for a same sex wedding ceremony\nStarted over six years go now in July of two thousand twelve Thursday Afternoon to Joe ... bakery\nAnd asked me to create a wedding cake for their same sex in the great case for same sex weddings they were surprised to make you know to the shop other has to work a cookie is\nJust great cakes are safe sex weddings\nAnd so they got bad for the short stormed out of my store ... ... ... [noise]\nWell okay so we have to be clear or his I always want to educate my my audience so we understand these things\nIf somebody goes into a hardware store and says I Want to buy hammer and the person who's a hardware store says you seem to gay I don't want to sell you a hammer get outta my store I hate gays or maybe uses an even more ... term for gays\nEvery body in America would agree that is not okay if you have a store and you're selling cameras you got us all hammers to everybody it's none of your business ... what they are or what have you know but we're not talking about that we're not talking about a lunch counters refusing to serve a hamburger or to\nA lunch counters refusing to serve a hamburger or to black customers we're not talking about that we're talking about somebody coming to you and saying I Want you to ... I Want you to use your to stick skills\nTo help us celebrate something that we think is really beautiful and should be celebrated and at that point you say well this is complicated because you're not asking me to sell you a sheet cake\nFor her birthday you're asking me to create something and to enter into a celebration of something that because my faith that can't celebrate now let's be clear you don't celebrate Halloween you there's a lot of things that you as a Christian you say I don't agree with that and you're living at your face in your cake shops\nThat is true this is October returned down dozens of cakes to celebrate Halloween because my Christian faith I don't believe that you can do it in good faith and to celebrate the same sex wedding\nUgly Bible teaches just betrays to celebrate something other than the ... corps for the said I'd be glad the so the cookies brownies anything else or make other custom\nKicks for birthdays graduation says it's a great gigs go against teaching so I'm like\nOkay so they want to sue you they did to you and Matt Sharp what happens at that point\nWell unfortunately or as we might expect actually the civil rights commission and and all the way through the Colorado court system they ruled against jak ah they found that despite the fact that Jack serves everyone in and even this couple Harry gladly would have served him uh you know off the shelf item cookies cupcakes but\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation\nAnd so we took it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court and we're glad to see in a a strong decision a seven to decision that the court said Colorado you are demonstrating hostility towards ... elite\nUm how you've been forced is what you said about his beliefs all show that he wasn't getting a fair shake and and the state was targeting him because of his beliefs about marriage and that is impermissible under our constitution\nWell it's an amazing thing first of all I think it needs to be said again all Americans need to understand that we're living in crazy times I mean somebody might just say you know what Jack I got to be honest I totally disagree with you I think you're wrong\nIt's another thing to say you're illegal what you're doing is a crime in you're going to pay and we're going to sue you and you're going to pay and then to have the state agree and say yeah you have no right to have this point of view because I I just want to be perfectly clear\nPeople listening because ... you don't have to agree with me or with Jack you don't need to agree with us\nIt's one thing to say I disagree it's another thing to say I disagree so strongly I think you are doing something criminal and you need to pay through the nose you need to suffer for this this is not OK and the state says yeah we agree this is criminal\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just beyond it's not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views\nI mean look people like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy but you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their views whether you think it's crazy or you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up with its great lawyers and say we're going to have to go to court and this goes all the way to the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was argued member yeah go ahead go ahead Jack\nGo ahead no you go ahead okay it was a you know what I Know in December the fifth December the fest okay I just\nThink that was the seventeenth so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC its root for Gorsuch Roberts all of them\nAnd it was a cellar to let's be clear whether they seven to two decision seven to two okay now this is a big thing I Want to say this again are we in America need to understand this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices agreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battle it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado get this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp in\nLegal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist in somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and it's the\nBest part of my job as it were able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding Idaho person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand\nThat this most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff to shut you down because they think you're a big it is I Want to say folks\nYou don't want to underscore this for my listeners that this is a chilling thing I mean here you are running your business ... business in both senses in and doing a good job and as I say I've I've I've met you I Know you and I know folks who know you\nAnd your ear the last thing or the last thing where people would call you is a is a big it and yet you've been vilified the almost lost everything folks that were going to go to a break but I just want to tell you\nOnline submitting freedom need your help so they can defend folks like jak soaps imagine what this would have

somebody has come to you and said okay you're not done we're gonna make you fight again we want you to make a transition cake which almost sounds like a joke like it sounds like is this real transition cake I when I heard that I thought\nThis is just um it's just extraordinary somebody's you know sort of playing head games it's like a ... let's see if we can get Jack Fields to make a transition cake\nA and now you have to go back to court effectively don't you\nYesterday it was truly freedom right back to help us again the shots is the best lawyers I Know so that juries are going to be working with is see if we get to straighten up to start [noise]\nWhat's that ... where do you see this going I mean uh what is the next step who ... what's the first battle\nYeah so it's kind of two two phases one we've got to\nThat same civil rights commission that the Supreme Court ruled against it is demanding a hearing on this um and so I think it's ... scheduled sometime in February but we're working with jak were going on the off chance on that since so we've actually filed a lawsuit against the the civil rights commission and the state\nAs essentially trying to put a stop to this that enough is enough jak has already been in the six years we've got a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThe state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of this is asking the federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over to the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is kicked design\nYeah how much bake any getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court it's kind of nuts\nYeah not enough food to still

of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is and what we're describing here religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had to liberate the rarest thing\nAre really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um the thank you for I'm referencing my book a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick is and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now\nUm but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now they Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so it it's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this\nUm said that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is that can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and\nPotentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that uh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is it your feeling that uh the the precedent of
