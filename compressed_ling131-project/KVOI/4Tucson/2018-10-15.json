one of our radio listeners\nDescribe the chronicle of the Old West you know the chronicle of the Old West has more stories about the Old West than any other publication and the stories are actual ... from Eighteen hundreds newspapers maybe you're asking yourself\nAfter that if it's going over the side and doing all these other things it's normally done and miniatures\nOr nowadays it's done digitized where they've taken that engine and the equipment digitize it and then they can do whatever they want with it\nIn a like under siege two months ago we had combinations of like a set that we built that was up on stilts over a railroad car and then I ran a locomotive through that set\nAnd they had a mirror on the other end and they film from the side so the camera was actually photographing the mirror\nWhich saw the locomotive coming straight through the car so that was a part of it along with real things along with digital things in miniatures okay now it's gotten very digital though but the initial hit is normally with a real train a real car\nDo you wear safety belts in are you in a that safety seat\nYou know that's a\nThat's up to me and at times if I Know there's parts in pieces flying everywhere all wear a helmet and I'll wear some more you have safety goggles anyway when you're on a train but the one thing I really made a mistake was I forgot put my ear plugs in one time\nAnd that was actually on the film eraser with Schwarzenegger\nAnd it was because they kept building and building the explosion and underneath the car and I said what are we doing you know\nAnd it was a nine cameras shoot so it was going to happen in one take I'm sure and I went down I saw these are mortars underneath the car\nAnd I said guys I said you were these going and they said well we're going to lift the car just before you hit it and I said these mortars are higher than the\nBottom of the fuel tank [laughter] this is this is on a crossing\nIt'll rupture of the field tech will have a fire alright about four thousand gallons of diesel seat once again nobody thought of that and there was a safety officer from Warner Brothers the gym that's about what a good thought\nBut if you understand what happens sometimes your head is so involved in trying to control what's happening on the on the scene on the set\nThat I got back in and I said okay let's get this over and I got put my ear plugs in and I'm telling you I I lost my hearing in my left ear that very shot and and it's never been to say\nThat's just amazing and I I can see how if I'm doing a movie and we all live as ... as as people who watch the movies we all love a lot of\nAction in in drama and and and all of that so you really want to do it and probably he doesn't have any real background in that area\nSo Jim it's up to you to tell him to back off man now were your engines were the trains the cars and everything standard are where they something special\nNo they were all standard A N n standard to as a standard gauge\nYou know also which is the common size throughout the world for for trains but also use some narrow gauge stuff too but they were real trains when I use the equipment they were real trains\nMaybe we would cut the tops off of a box car or a caboose and then we would build another car on top of that chassis\nBut that way I had the right set of trucks whichever we'll sets I had it breaks I had a couple of years and all we did was build a body on top but we were we were real railroad when I did\nIt and that was part of why I've retired as things got more and more we're going to do it digital you know and I go in and why don't we just do it for real area you know it isn't that hard and actually costs less and they just given that we don't want to do it that way\nAnd so you know it's a separation of those technologies now you know or I feel I Know how to do it the old way\nIn the right way and it looks great\nPeople in our computer oriented and they're the younger people that have taken over the business and they want to do it that way so best thing for me to do was to uh retire and uh when I Do give lectures talk to you and I build on race cars [laughter]\nYeah I have talked to stunt people who have been in the stunt field for a long time and they give much the same response that they are not needed as much because they go to digital they carry out that stunt all his for his digital\nNow your background is race cars right\nThat's correct you know I I couldn't find a way to own trains when I got out of high school and before I got out of high school I race cars that the drag strip it was just something I enjoyed I loved\nAnd everybody say boy I don't you have any model trains I go no I like the twelve inch to the full scale and until I got a four way to get them you know I'll just paint murals of trains on the side of my race cars and that was actually what I was famous for\nAnd I raised for Chrysler at the time my cars recalled Jim Clark semi express and I write for ... for a long time about Thirteen Years\nBut then I was able when I moved to Nevada in the seventies\nTo work at the Nevada state railroad museum and become a part of the company that did the restoration there\nAnd that's where I started to pick up the knowledge that I needed and then eventually equipment and on the railroad and in the end on three different railroads lots of equipment and it all grew you know into the movie business but also doing the dinner trains or you know wind trains and all that too\nBut I really\nEnjoyed the racing years and I went back to that when I retired for a hobby building some old race cars\nYou have mentioned building a railroad track if I had a movie and it's out of nowhere and I say Jim I Want you to put your train down here and I want to have a trained go by how much track do you have to lay\nMob is on how fast we have to go you know normally ... you can you build a half a mile to as much as in the Lone Ranger in one location alone we built just under five miles\nBecause we wanted to go thirty to forty miles an hour and we needed a lot of ways to switch cars and put cars out of the way and that kind of a thing [noise]\nSo you know in in rural roads even when you build them like that which of course they're not going to be run an Amtrak on them but they're still about [noise]\nOh heck a cheaper all wrote it'd be a half a million a mile and up\nAnd I've I've heard how much it takes to do a film and I would imagine a few miles of track would be something else\nJim Clark thank you very very much for telling us about your experiences with the movies and with trains I Know you have a lot of experience that you're taking with you away from the movie industry and you're doing a lot of\nTalks about trains in the wind thank you for joining us\nThere more than welcome thank you for asking Dakota [noise] keep up the good work\nWant them back to chronicle of eels west weekly edition I'm your host decode a live say\nI have on the phone right now my good friend Bob Alexander Bob how are things going for you buddy\nWell down here that are going great a got a new book and we've been on some other historical project without work in a way about what's going on down there a\nRanger hall of fame in ... than it was like oh I Know you were down there and then we had a couple of years ago and we're glad I didn't write\nAnd speaking of the Texas Rangers and the Old West than the heritage your new book six shooters and shifting sans\nCovers these things it's a it's a book about Texas Ranger Frank Jones but before we get into it the title is very intriguing to me tell me why that title\nBut as you mentioned is six shooters and shifting than the wild west live Texas Ranger stats and Frank stone and the title basically that six shooters but the\nThe prospect the breeder in the timeframe and other words if not about modern era Texas Rangers the shooters were kind of a I'm an allergy that's hot hard and fast to the old way of shifting than\nIf you're not familiar with the story already a\nPanic gives you a Clinton's because the end of the book for the end of the story is whereas if the fans of the Rio Grande below El Paso right there in El Paso county Buffalo's city play a\nSignificant and revealing part of the Frank Joe\nRight right you mentioned earlier the print Jones we'd go wild and investigate shootings and investigate things did he ever have confrontations with the bad guys as a Texas Ranger captain\nOh you have one on one trip home he a at a shootout with somebody that was going to do it in another county deputy sheriff it comes to human says they need to help ... involved in this shooting situation in another instance he was involved in the shooting a\nSituation with some though Robert\nIn another instance there was some ... Abd day a Texas Ranger and then as I did for the brush so to speak in like Jones who is involved in a hunting for that guy and capturing\nThat person and of course during that it's so there was some gun play involved in he was right there in the middle of it and of course when you describe line this story that he was involved in a leather going for it\nYou know sometimes we think of officers as sitting in an office\nAnd doing reports and the like but ... Jones was out there among them even as a captain you were talking about how ... Jones is lined ended up tell us a little bit about that\n... the ticker tape it I was like bread tastes dumping the is one of the few people off in that Old West era within in the service he was said mired by nearly every one\nOf his company a state it was written many of 'em just adored him because he would leave with from the saddle or\nHe would be out there with them on the line of course he was like any other administrator he was somewhat hamstrung by administrative duties and paperwork and all this\nBut when push came to shove it um to get out in the field rank Jones we wrap beer with these men and pictures of it in the book\nThey all went together on one occasion and bought him a very fancy inexpensive a pocket watch and had to do to bully in grade is a\nToken of their admiration and the same for him out in West Texas below El Paso as I said earlier but I ended up out there and there's the band of Spanish Mexican guy ... would have had pretty well\nThat's the county or out from under control of the ... frankly sampling the sheriff didn't have the man's house\nOr the resources financial resources to be a healing with the problem and now we're partitions from citizens woman arrange your company out there and so ... Jones's companies companies the\nWhich by the way in the course of the frontier battalion era history\nI lost ... ranked in the line of\nDuty and that's not me than any other company in the history of the ... states interesting\nSo I'm In other words if they were very active and even though all through the say them different times when they were posted it different errors in Eighteen Ninety three Frank Jones was transferred to his company transferred to a sweater but she just below El Paso\nAnd within a week he was in this that little leading a a group of strangers and they were in the ... on making some arrests on some recent indictments set of El Paso\nAnd some of the Senate and not to sit\nIn and day does that were just really they were danced they had the ... pretty well a living here and that's where the titles shifting sand sums up the house earlier\nBecause of shifting a geological\nThings I'm not a up to date on all of it at the river had gotten a urine and blood to cut a new channel and so that was to Long Island in the middle of the river I cross the river and be on that island and he'll be in Texas\nAre you ... you know matching area line on that I\nTend to you miss interesting was very bad deal with\nAnd it was a ... habit it in other words people lived donate them basically\nIt was the class of people that were all men are just Sammy and that it had a nickname the island did have higher rates Iowa oh so many of the uh\nOutlaws and San Diego to find refuge on the island and hardly any\nTexas lawman would go over there and hardly any Mexican uh soldiers are federal rallies wanted to go on the albums and it was more or less a safe haven but anyway thank Jones had these wants and he uh everybody up several rangers and they decided that might be the way\nAnd so that's what the catalyst shifting sand some so yeah that's what happened they didn't get involved in an lipic cheated out with these bandied does that it'd be like in white farm and come to find out\nShooting at least a third on the Mexican side\nOf the Iowa all across the imaginary line and that's where the capital are part of the title comes from the shifts fans during this got applied rank Jones was hit in the sky rocket boy and of course he and another ranger completely off of their cars\nAnd to show you what he was made a world leaders gushing blood for me but he got his leg in front of having these courses linked ... flying he position just laying out in front of him\nAnd on with very six shooter from it that broke and he started siding with six\nShooter and some ... apple barrel and a peek over ... and are not Frank Jones or in a band Ito lift each other and I we don't know but as the ... and the awful barrel came out over this\nLittle of both the wall shot rang out in the book tour into Frank kiss ranger Tucker who was rocks dive captain zones of force heard\nThe report if the guy in the hearts bullets something to eat ... after your own life\nAnd kind of under ... forever and mumbling ... which is understandable life saving that wound to the fair right rank gone\nBad boy I'm keel wow and he was forced enforce the battle kept on for a little while and then one of the rangers who was for me it with area finally Rhoda is hey boys were in Mexico for\nBeing told them to soldiers or fix them because they're made arrangements with a Hamas from with some things to care for the body but then they had just getting\nBack to the American side in a first the authorities in Mexico with not really the body but after some negotiations size zero semi you later right at the edge of a little in Texas with like a\nMilitary site with reimbursement for the basis of getting the capital of Saudi back more or less site implication that he had to put some money and somebody's hand mhm for them to release the body\nThey finally got Frank ... body a return that well it's this link gesture raffle and uh his pocket walk citizen awarded doing\nBy the man of the company and a a specially made bad she has an order from a job or they never did recover his hands test or a six shooter probably somebody just so and so on the Mexican side is souvenirs\nBut anyway that's basically the story of that and find the book is filled with footnotes since photograph near five hundred pages Long Beach and uh so much a Texas Ranger\nThey ... they\nAre much effect right straight back from any one nice\nYes and Bob you are known for your footnotes for your research and for your great writing now how can someone get a copy of six shooters and shifting sans\n... by the University of north rare\nTributaries that Texas I Am breaking down their outlets like\nI said that you can contact your local bookstore\nAnd they'll be happy to get that book but I Am actually you
