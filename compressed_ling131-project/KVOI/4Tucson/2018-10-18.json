chief name Kelvin Cochran I've been telling you about him for the last few days because he was represented by alliance defending freedom to read you some\nOf this article by David French National Review quote in a groundbreaking when for religious liberty former fire chief Calvin Cochran has reached at one point two million dollar settlement with the city of Atlanta\nYesterday my friend and former colleagues at the alliance defending freedom announced that former Atlanta fire chief Cochran had received a one point two million dollar settlement in a case he brought effort to city fired him for writing and distributing to a few select city employees a self published book\nThat articulated in entirely orthodox Christian view of section marriage\nIs Cochrane was a pioneer born in Confederate Memorial Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana happened to be black grew up to be coming out of the first black firefighters in his hometown fire department ultimately became the first black fire chief of tree port\nObama appointed him to run the fireman is racial division at the federal the division of FEMA after he left the Atlanta fire department which he went to after report the fire department struggle the Atlanta mayor asking to come back eternity department around\nNow on his own time\nHe sought received permission from the city's ethics officer to self publish a Christian book the book is called who told you that you are naked\nIt argues in part that sets outside of marriage between a man and a woman country too will of God and of course takes a position that opposite sex marriage also contrary to the will of God\nKids to read the book to a few select colleagues mainly people who already discussed the Christian faith with him he also shared it with the mayor three members of the city council no fire department employee ever complain to him about the book one employee did show a few pages of the book that dealt with sexuality to an openly gay Atlanta city council member\nThat led to Cochran being suspended without pay that led to the mayor and city firing him without providing them due process\nShe was represented by alliance defending freedom the organization that I've been raising money for for the past two and a half weeks I'm asking you one more time to please\nHelp out chief Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of south that could happen anywhere isn't to alliance defending freedom counsel David Cortland\nI Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened in the chiefs case and then all of these other cases\nYou know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive be a it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing the chief and it's quite ironic just say that we're being inclusive intolerant by firing someone\nWho disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually happened\nNow alliance defending freedom represented a chief Cochran\nFor free to him but the cost of litigating something like this especially cases like jak Philips the owner of the map to peace caked truck whereas his case when all we have to the Supreme Court\nIt can be very expensive so please help this consortium of lawyers who were defending people whose religious rights are under attack\nPlease call eight six six four three
