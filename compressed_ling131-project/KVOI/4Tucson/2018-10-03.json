I wake up at six am on Monday morning\nWhen I hear the news that Canada has signed onto this agreement it's good for all three countries but no role they up to three hundred percent dairy sheriff so this is a big win for farmers um and and now they're sets up very nicely\nFor um port negotiating you know the big big deal is gonna come hopefully with China because they they are the worst that you know abusers of the trade laws and on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there yesterday at the rose garden when Donald Trump held a press conference and one of the points you made\nHis he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but why is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nStephen Moore is my guest economic advisor to President Trump during the twenty sixteen campaign Steven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased um or economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of economics\nOf time economists down Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI ... you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help now you're helped\nPass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved to me that's just the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a we have a a a a a a new a free trade agreement is now called the you asked them to see a we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new a North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries is modernized because America has a better deal\nAnd so I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about fifty also very it got me on that one I've not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan\nI show I'm going to agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Lois terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just the way it was just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we talked about this on your show before more and more what Americans producers called intellectual property with his\nComputer software we patent since copyrights him and technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they just steal or an actual property and this new um now that has very strongly that this new\nUh I'll call it the U.S a CNA has much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a ton of economic advisor to President Trump between sixteen campaign Steven you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand as the president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what what Obama was referring to is he said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and they can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction house back to this country and they kept bringing coal jobs back and\nMaybe maybe Donald Trump that was that I have a magic wand because we do\nWe do have a job since the election one million additional construction manufacturing and mining jobs and this happened Larry because things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden of taxation we lower the burden of regulation\nWe allow companies to do their thing and got them right off the back of our businesses and the other twenty seven million small businessmen and women in this country respond to that and they are hiring more people\nI don't know if you saw the news today that uh\nThat uh one of the major um\nOr Amazon I Believe it was there were all raised their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't want the government to tell companies to do that but they're doing it 'cause it's so tightly\nI don't know if you saw the news today that uh that uh one of the major um\nAmazon I Believe it was going to raise their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't want the government to tell companies to do that but they're doing it 'cause it's a tight labor market economy is booming it's hard to get workers uh this is exactly what we tried to do when we put this plan together Larry Kudlow and I for Donald Trump two years ago\nStephen Moore is my guest even economists Stephen pick the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the tournaments programs and even Obama said we're automatic pilot or this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief we've also spent money especially on defense and so our debt has increased are you worried about that\nWell you shouldn't be that I'll tell you one statistic though you know caused it is doing so well now I mean you know we've got two straight quarters now four percent growth and then Obama never got us you know the last year he was present at one point six percent that additional growth\nJust part of the whole of his very I\nI thought it was similar to when I went on NBC and said my husband is being played by the vast right wing conspiracy I I\nI almost I almost sued him for plagiarism\nDefensive ah and\nI don't
