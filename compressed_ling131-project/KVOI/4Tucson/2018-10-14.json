Scott political forum on the Saturday afternoon to drink\nBy my voice turned thirty I Am to be alive by the way we're remembering the drunks he's gone showing November first two afternoons Monday through friday four to six in the afternoon you'll drive home and I'll Try to inform you are on all things happening politically in our town I've had for the last uh almost Thirty years\nI was flipping David Wells with the Grand Canyon Institute is my guest and this portion of our Saturday as far away um prevalent prop one twenty six will cut education funding uh your Grand Canyon Institute David is done quite a bit of research on that\nAnd the and the price that could be two hundred and fifty million or more explain what prop one twenty six years and what it will do to funding education David\n... prop one twenty six us but on the ballot right Arizona realtors and it's been about six million dollars or so far on it I mean what is it prohibits\nUm the taxation of services are beyond anything that's attacks or at the end of last year and a problem with that uh in terms of the education sales tax because we have it in place\nBut what's it's going to expire in twenty Twenty one and the legislature it's technically a new tax um and so a based on our reading of it and then the courts would end up having the final say on it uh there's actually a third of the revenues that come in and the state sales tax for education is actually from services right now\nUm it comes from things like utilities or restaurants and bars lodging and all those kinds of things are actually I'm classified as services which is ... ... doesn't define but that is what generally economists classified as services\nAnd um so it's it's a two hundred and fifty million dollar a annual hit that a prop one twenty six or comes with\nThis project to Arizona taxpayer actors when it's colder twenty or Jane ... I Believe amend the constitution to restrict state and municipal governments from imposing any taxes on services\nWhich were not already in place of December thirty first twenty Seventeen you but you're saying these that were in place are going to be affected right\nBut when they get renewed ... and they gave me new there's a reason that the legislature had to have a two thirds vote in order to renew it uh and are are not a you know and it sort of a ... reauthorization of it and that that technically in a new tax\nOr and or they didn't make simply extend the existing tax so at a so that we think it's going to fall under it I Would think the same thing is going to happen to Pima County they transferred you have a transportation taxes have sent 'em that's going to expire in twenty twenty six\nI'm an currently brings in about eighty million dollars a year and we the Pima County losing thirty million of that if prop one twenty six passes a and a and the part that's really a ... a sort of the foolery for um\nUh for the citizenry ideas that if we're actually going to increase taxes on services are like the way they said we're going to do it to your nail salon or your whatever thing that they they indicate a in their ads out voters would get the final say anyway 'cause ah\nWhen we increase taxes in Arizona it ends up on the ballot and voters get to decide whether they want to be taxed or not and so it's completely unnecessary\nI this is a two hundred and fifty million dollar hit during the educational system is already under funded were were you know I I tell you uh I forget ... I don't necessarily need to be forgiven for this I just don't believe Doug do she has the has the means by which do pay for theirs twenty twenty or twenty percent Druze for teachers\nAre in a year twenty twenty I don't know where he's going to get the money and you know what he doesn't know where he's going to get the money I make now you get this situation where you may lose another two hundred and fifty million this is going to be so screwed up\nA bit but he wanted to bail himself out of some terrible a hot water that I was an when you had fifty thousand\nTeachers on your front lawn a demanding more money and he said well I get to the money or twenty twenty don't worry about it well we're all worried about it do you know where he's going to get the money 'cause I don't\nLet me first say something nice about him a ... and ... because that is on prop one twenty six you know you probably noticed that um have introduced the and David Garcia disagree on a lot of things and one thing they actually agree on that they're both opposed to prop one twenty six\nSo um and so I think ah if people realize that regardless of who they are gonna vote for governor they should think about that I mean I think in terms of the revenues for the yeah the um the twenty by twenty twenty plan I mean right now the states doing okay in terms of its wrote the revenues because based on\nUh the ... the fact of the states and the economy sort of picked up people are moving here again I'm at this point it's to me it's like OK through twenty twenty but again you if you get a two hundred and fifty million dollar hit and twenty Twenty one\nAt a bit of a big kick up this week and a and so at some point we're going to have an economic downturn when that happens the revenues are going to shrink uh and uh and then there won't be that extra money that\nPeople are expecting in there so we right and there are lots of things that we haven't funded yet cause it to you know we funded the the pay increases but we haven't put in the extra money to lower some of the class size is we have lots\nAnd lots of teachers who are in classrooms with more than thirty students and um so we have a long ways to go it was a that was the start and where we have a lot lately I don't want to go to get to the finish a and so um\nYeah so it's they're certainly going to be a question mark to me at this point I I'm reasonably confident that by the fiscal you're twenty twenty English as the next fiscal year will be okay but we're there will be silky and twenty Twenty one and twenty twenty two is a big question mark\nRoberto ... or ... or ... political forum with David Wells with the Grand Canyon Institute Roberta\nHello my name is representative camp our family when I ran for office in twenty
