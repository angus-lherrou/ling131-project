stories and e books [noise]\nWhy do we call it cowboy cowboy\nBecause at one time we all wanted to be a cowboy even the ladies and where do you work on a ranch in Wyoming are living in an apartment

flavor look no further dog Jake is a great lion of the hand tools leather luggage and briefcases\nThese are top quality products at a reasonable price I've had a computer case in portfolio for over three years and they've been everywhere with me but they still look like new sunny as a handbag but she also uses as a briefcase she loves it\nThings like that so when they went to town\nTown rules didn't always mesh with range rules and they didn't quite know how to live by town rules and that's where a lot of problem came\nOut on a range some guy crush them or some guy really really messed up big time he was in for a pretty good ...\nWell you do that in town and actually you know the sheriff lock you up there you go and all they were doing was what they normally did right now here's something else too when they went to town they like\nDrinking and gambling and the ladies or coerced ahah but an interesting thing is that a lot of the ranchers would not allow a deck of cards\nBooze or guns on around up through the or the cow camps\nI think it was a jolly good night who would fire a man for swearing\nInteresting yeah well he said and he didn't allow cards and guns and he said that you guys are here to work you're not here to fight and he said I'm eliminating anything that can start a fight\nWell I Would imagine that with a bunch of guys together again as you talked about earlier the job is a very tense job has a lot of dangerous to the job in my gun fights of the Old West CD\nI said the gunfight throw the result of one of three things women booze and gambling at the house you don't have the women on the trail drive but if you've got cards and if you've got liquor you got\nTwo out of three and that next year through guns into the formula you really got an issue out again quite often in town the guy setting there does not have a gun on him up in his room and so he will get mad jump up go up to his room come back down and yeah\nThat's right you know the Old West was nothing more than a bunch of guys trying to make a living\nNo more than today and things that went on on the job or a whole lot like things are going on the job today\nPeople just haven't changed that much right [laughter] and they're not going to [laughter]\nWell you know particularly again we're talking about young boys were a teenager job right teenagers and we know how teenagers

W. W. dot who do we're ... we're dot com or cold sunny a dog Drake\nWon't\nCome back to ... weekly EDITION on your own decoder lives were in the midst of a phone conversation with John boy you're about books in spring actually\nHe eventually took off with a a singer dancer at the birdcage theater\nShe was known as blonde Molly but she was also known as Molly Williams Molly Edwards and Mali Bradshaw we have documents with these different names on them so we really don't know what for correct name is\nLike Mali was as I said a peroxide blonde singer at the birdcage\nShe had her rights and to start with a man by the name of Mike Bradshaw which is where she acquired one of those names we don't know if they were married or not though\nIn those days when a man like Bradshaw showed up in town a with a lovely lady on his arm he was called a map and they see a a man who found customers for his lady oh people would also say men like Bradshaw work quote blacksmith thing for their ladies\nInteresting [laughter] shortly after Frank Leslie set\nHis eyes upon blonde Molly\nMike Bradshaw was found in one of the back alleys of tombstone with his head bashed in there was nothing to point fingers at Leslie for this but of course his name came up quite often\nBut there was never anyone um arrested or tried for the murder of Mike Bradshaw a Leslie and blonde Molly then set off into the Swiss tell them that\nLuxury had acquired partial ownership of a a ranch in the town's called the magnolia branch and so he and blonde Molly headed off to supposedly live a life of bliss in the mountains\nAnd they stayed on the ranch they probably would have done quite well but they\nOften visited town frequenting the drinking establishment from one end of tombstone to the other\nAnd Mali could hold her own with Leslie when it came to liquor and they often argue well well into the night as they go so they're copious amounts of liquor\nNow in July or early July of Eighteen eighty nine Leslie and Mali were in town and they were celebrating independence day\nUh their level refer to the celebration continued for about a week before they finally should stop their horses and hit it out of town and they were drunk and they left\nAnd they were still pretty started by the time they got back to the ranch which was about July chance they were still arguing from the time they left him some 'til the time they arrived at the ranch\nBy the next day Lesley who is still quite ... went to his neighbors ranch and threatened to kill him told him to go get a God I'm going to kill you will appear in the ranchers name was William rent rentals\nHad seen Leslie in this condition before just told him to go away\nSo laissez Les laughed and staggered home in the meantime Molly who also still was quite an eighth grade it was under the tender care of Iran chant by the name of change Neal\nNeal really which had seen as Boston this condition before and he usually kind of stayed out of the way when Leslie got struck\nBuddies felt sorry for for Mali and so we kind of sat with her it's allegedly showed up again\nWell Leslie immediately thought there was some hanky panky going on between James Neal and his lovely blonde Molly\nAnd with out much recourse at all he turned around and shot in Mali and she died almost instantly whoa you didn't turned us down on his ranch and James Neal and shot him in the leg\nAnd he was able to escape and ran out into the desert and lovely thought he was just going to die in the desert\nBut let's see did go the next day back to the rental branch to see if his ranch and it ended up there\nHe had ended up there but Reynolds refused to tell Leslie that the lesson England Away assuming no one was a lie that knew what had happened at the ranch and he eventually started back in tombstone he was found on the road\nHe told his story see as being the heart and a husband who have lost his lovely blonde Molly because his ranch chance that shot his wife and then he had shot James Neal in self defense\nAs he's telling a story to the sheriff James nailed who is still quite injured walks into the room or down the entire story\nSo this time once again Leslie was put on trial at this time on unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you regard Leslie he was convicted up the murder of blonde Molly\nHe was forty eight years old when he answered you know for instance it's an interesting story of his arrival it you know he was with ten other prisoners and they were let out of coaches county jail by um sheriff down slaughter by the time all of the prisoners arrived in Yuma\nThey were drunk a sky box\n[laughter] there you could make any assumption you want but it's it's my opinion that probably someone and they could have very well have been Frank Leslie convinced John slaughtered to make a nice one last stop for sending them into the depths of humor for instance\nYou know ... ... what's the use of the human junior seven ... seven\nYears that was a life sentence and he served seven years\nWhich number one was not unusual for the sentences back them to be cut down considerably I mean it was a regular thing but at the same time\nI've talked to people who sued the free once we got some special privileges during the prison I've also talk to other people should know he was just a regular prisoner but\nHe did serve in the pharmacy departments therefore you got special privileges as far as that was concerned he was able to keep ... large mush dish which most people had to shave their heads\nAs well as the seasons and what is your opinion do drink once we get special privileges\nI think he got special privileges because he was one of the few educated prisoners over there which is why he was serving in the I think one of the reasons he got that job in in the pharmacy he was able to read and write very few of the prisoners could at that time\nSo he was probably a value prisoner to them because of his of his education so yes I think he got so special privileges because of his background more than anything else\nNo one for English we go to other human too to prison what happened to him and\nUh well let's go back to walk and he is still interests he gave one of his infamous interviews this\nWell interest on the Cape wind up the infamous interviews this time to a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle [noise] this is where he claimed he was born in Virginia's one and only time he said he was he the Virginia before\nBut this article appeared in the article at that time when it appeared a woman living in San Francisco a divorced by the name of bell stole read this story and became quite enamored with our Frank Leslie what's in his eye for the ladies\nHelped him out so they'll stole began sending him food thing while he was still in prison\nAnd of course their friendship blossom doubts washing the waiting for when he was really\nWhen he was released it is released in November of Eighteen Ninety six and on the Kemper first at that same year he stole ordinary in Stockton we don't know what happened about ... just kind of walked out of his life at some point we had no record of whatever happened to her\nWe do know that Leslie was probably in Mexico in early Eighteen Ninety seven so she didn't last long at all eat supposedly went down to Mexico with geologists and there is a story that while he was down there he killed three now and\nAgain there's a lot of groups the story is even one story that says what do they lack of oldfield but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "4Tucson", "city": "Cortaro", "day":
