I'm going to say a strategic planned focus with the resources to go along with it\nSo we can see cause effect bang for buck this is the results that we get\nI think it's going to be challenging for the Republican majority more than likely it'll do majority um to come up with a money promise by this governor Doug ... of the twenty twenty plan which is a twenty percent increase for teenagers over the next few years to twenty twenty on the ... the economy is booming and it's getting better\nBut whether that's going to build this board I don't know I mean it's going to it's going to take some real imagination to try to match this promise to these teachers and they're going to demand it because they that they want to promise kept\nExactly if you make a promise you got to be able to keep up ... one of the things that we need to look at is growing our economy right down here in southern Arizona Maricopa County is just to me so why aren't we booming as well I Know that there are businesses that are coming into\nOur area but we need to bring more we need to bring higher paying jobs\nAnd that way we can increase our tax base here so we do we have the revenue should be able to support things like teachers pay raises\nSo how do we do that here in southern Arizona we've always been a stepchild to Maricopa County when it comes to economic development what are we do wrong that they do right\nI Believe we need to be a stronger voice I Know we have people here that have been speaking very strongly for our community and been big advocates but we need to get mightier and have more people speaking for us from southern Arizona and the right people in the state legislature to be able to make that our voices heard\nWhat are we do about K through twelve education do we need a designated a funding mechanism for for K. through twelve funding some somewhere along the way it's going to take a lot more money than we have right now\nWhat we have a lot of money coming into the state I've been looking at the budget out what's coming into the state for education and what we have in our general a third of your expertise isn't it really oh you're a numbers person I'm well they called me up a number ... I like to see what the numbers look like\nBut more importantly what do the performance metrics what what is the value that we get what's her return on investment and how we can focus and target\nAre scarce resources to get the most maximum effect\nSo how do we do that [laughter] that you've asked the question what's the answer is\nWell it starts with the plant\nGoing back to what's division for education system here my vision of for us to have an education system that puts our children's academic success first\nAnd having that is our vision then the rest of the um\nUh operational areas functional areas funding um the teachers the workload everything will then start falling into place and so you'll have the vision and that gets in to watch our strategy on how we're going to get there so in order to have a strategy we've got to look at our goals\nGot to look at our objectives and and we also need to have an action plan to get us there many many people do strategic planning but they don't do they I call them had the strategic plan on the shelf are called the spot and said isn't is a beautiful\nEight by eleven glossy document but no you don't need that what you need is really tough action plans to say this is what we're going to do this is how much money we're going to put behind it this is how we're going to measure the performance and these are the results that we're getting if it's an increase\nAbsolutely thank you John where are the challenges that people have a gym to choose the board members for this year's a name a community college\nWell there are two districts that are have open seats where the incumbents are not running\nAnd those are the only two uh two seats that are up this year has her district free uh currently held by Sylvia Lee who is not running for reelection and the candidates and that are Maria Garcia and a former PCC board member named Vicky Marshall\nAnd district five which is occupied by a Luis can solace or the former state legislator a he is stepping down and Luis ... no relation is running for that seat\nUm and the other person running for that is a gal named Debbie chase maybe uh so\nUh Vicki uh I've known for a long time or we served on the board together for twelve years are a number of things I like about her even though she's way more liberal than I Am more of a government union advocates than I Am a I don't know that much about Maria Garcia\nA and I don't know that much about Louis ... I Do know a little bit about Debbie chase maybe on like when I see out her so far I attended the candidate forum that was held at the ... district office on ah September twentieth and you don't have a few impressions from that\nShow them whether it's alright is so [noise] um\nA couple of the candidates are big fans of our old developmental ed program which are in our discussions in the past we've shown is not effective uh and\nPretty expensive and uh they want to bring more of that back rather than focus on the workforce programs that lead to a more gainful employment\nUm and [noise]\nOther than that you know a\nLuis and Maria didn't have that much uh then I thought they brought to the table in terms of ideas Debbie chase maybe I think understands policy governance and the relationship between\nA board and the c._e._o. or Vicki uh is the only one who actually came up with a new idea other than the usual lobbying the state legislature and begging for more money um and that was you know gathering all the former board members that Pima college has had\nAnd trying to leverage them into a more effective group ... voice for the college um but one thing that I liked about Vicki when she was on the board was\nI'm an engineer so I kind of understand this term she would go out and get ground data she would actually walk through a lot of the process is that students had to go through my taking classes herself and applying for the same kinds of\nThings that students have to apply for so that we know a lot of the frustrations that our customers feel\nLet me ask you what we're surveyor up in between the garbage words are it's most traumatic or I think a time in history when it was on a probation or a lot of people thought it was going to resolve in the right away a ... I'm Sorry we went through a change in leadership and his presidency ah in fact there were tremendous administration\nAlterations during that particular time\nWhat do you see from the borders that exist today and the challenges with this particular\nUh candidates running in two thousand and I think that would leave you back and do the beers or lead you further and further away from were being the community college was in the very dark times or to a time where we all want it to be a successful hire\nA Institute of learning a and a successful one because the real problem with being a ... student flight people aren't going there being robot is dropping every single year is not what it was\nYes well so energetic enrollment is a problem um I don't see it heading back into the abyss although the finances are challenging with with the enrollment declining we run up against this a legislative feature a call the expenditure limitation\nWhich uh is a mathematical formula that is based on the tax rate when the college was first formed\nPopulation growth a and some other stuff that actually makes sure that we are less well funded than almost any other community college in the state there are a couple of exceptions are\nLess funded than anybody else\nUh because of when we formed and the tax rates we had at the time right that stuff propagate\nA and it requires I Believe a constitutional change do you watch fortunately in Arizona is only fifty percent requirement not a two thirds but um it's it's a challenge\nAnd so that's why a challenge for community colleges much brighter than brother yeah there's tons of a similar a responsibility right yes um\n\nIn terms of in terms of leadership and the board and going back to the abyss uh I don't see a serious or a concern there um candidates are like Maria and Luis who are supported by sea fair uh\nExplain what that is okay she fair is a a group called the coalition for a accountability or fairness accountability integrity respect and responsibility um and there's a a word that they keep using their integrity\nThat I don't think really applies to them so I'm tempted to uh but\nThere are a and allegedly taxpayer group but they are largely a group that\nAdvocates for one particular category of student which is the unprepared students which I Believe ... have to take and has to deal with but we also have to create dynamics to make sure that we have less of them and that we can deal with the more\nI think it's not happening because one of the things that I think the single handedly separated from a great many other\nFamous amend the College Board members as you said look we just can't continue this process of letting anybody in\nA ... meter maid in eighth grade a standard I mean you got your you get into a situation where these people are not qualified to do better a freshman year of college and uh they use up all their their loan money and they don't have it any more yeah and and we just couldn't generally you know cycle there's one\nProblem after another of people just not qualified to go to college and you know that blood stop that well we we didn't do well we didn't we\nDidn't stop that but there were dynamics that we're heading in that direction anyway so a higher ... standing department of ed regulation that says that developmental ed courses that qualify for financial aid have to have ninth grade outcomes okay well if you don't\nIf you can't perform at least the seventh grade level you don't have a chance on other topics right oh so instead of offering financial aid or\nFor those students that don't qualify for the seventh grade standard uh our aim originally was shuttled them mostly toward\nA some online tutoring programs and adult that I Believe they're getting more help now I'm not exactly sure what that is and I believe that they have changed the way the students are tested so that less than test into that low level a time wasting thing but I think it's legitimately testing how old are you\nIra ... or in your mind starts to hurt a bit of a flight from the district of of of this was the reduced number of students every year ... what do you do\nOh you've got facilities we built for an increasing enroll but not a decreasing one yeah and they're ... they're they're sitting empty 'em and they're expensive\nYes well there is one way to dramatically increase the enrollment if you believe in ...\nAh dramatically increased the enrollment if you believe enrollment per se is the gold you should be chasing I don't believe it is I Believe that the goals you should be chasing is quality throughput that actually leads to jobs so\nWhat I like about a lot of courage emphasis in ... is the emphasis on the workforce programs uh aviation machine tool technology welding a computer aided design all\nThese tech programs nursing things like that which also have some strong educational dynamics built into them to make sure that the students are qualified and that is the independent certifications that uh industry associations do with those students upon graduation\nThat ensures the program has to have high standards coming out and in order to make sure that the students actually can meet that they have to have high standards coming in are you that is what leads to the good dynamics that\nAre you pleased with the leadership now the administration of being a college\nYes unequivocally no but in general yes I think it's ... All right I I I think it's strong ah I think it's heading in the right direction um the college I think is still a little too timid about\nA asserting its place in the educational supply chain but uh you know I'm gone so there's nobody really arguing for that anymore and uh I Believe uh it needs to be harder on ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "4Tucson", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "07"}
