the hard way south wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also military veteran you'd think he'd be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nAnd I'm not so long ago most Democrats would have nodded in agreement that today if hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining Marsalis joins us now\nMy thanks for coming on the show um did I miss state that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag or knew what the cross loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that I write hosted that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this polite tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time now a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't feel like that long ago it wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and Neal before the cross what is it Ben five even\nJust remember this is the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform member that\nThere's a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said to you since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I

wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however was insensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up to the flag is considered racist than what happens to the country do you think going forward\n[noise] that's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nOf the prosecutors
