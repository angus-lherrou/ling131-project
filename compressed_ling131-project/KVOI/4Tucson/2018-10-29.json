of aunt and her handwriting is more curses and and exaggerated slanted\nTongue emotions so we have that\nAlso and that to me this is the limos showstopper and the positive smoking gun and prove that two women are are two different when is that when ed someplace science to register on February first Nineteen oh one in New York City\nCraig cure your newspaper says that and that's it has left today on the stage for Denver\nInteresting mhm dated February second\nNineteen or one to me that's quite obvious that the states that and that's just could not be at two different places halfway across the

spent so much time on and life\nThat it's just every time this pops up it's it's just so ludicrous mhm I haven't spent a lot of time going back to try to find out but again it's when when you read this kind of things that the historians who believe it or the people that think they just take a little\nWe believe it or the people that think that they just take a little piece of this and a little piece of that like and lives in ... park her whole life mhm route and Sundance were outlaws who had to hide out in ...\nThe other thing is that some people I'm not one of them think that and and at a look an awful lot of light there's similarities and that they have dark hair and they both have bluegrass that's where it stops\nWindow I Am so glad that we talked about ... plays an ambassador because\nI had heard on several occasions\nAnd and yeah there were some people it is interesting that no one is saying the noon mass it was an angel obviously she was an outlaw however was driven to be coming out and she\nDefinitely be married Ernest marks shared with roses that they would definitely be married but he never could make that leap and\nWouldn't grows dice the only thing he could promise just that she wouldn't be arrogant outcasts cemetery but he wasn't able to look up to that promise either she was indeed buried and outcasts in theory but I mean and that's where you found a lot of the soil deaths\nThey were not to be even buried with polite society they had a whole another area that they could be put in along with the people that um or Haines for various crimes or um you know just homeless people come here that no one knew their names okay that's where they were placed\nUm so you know what is it profession that was deemed necessary in a lot of ways fly on\nThe city because they needed their funds but you had other places where it just was acceptable at all no one was going to give me a break with that\nOne of the ladies that I write about in the book is Josephine Washburne was it for a while and in Nebraska and really saw how poorly these ready to retreat and they cause in Nebraska and if you were caught\nAs I say playing or trade some place other than the house that you had a license for you not only were assigned to a huge fee for that but you also were paraded on the back of a wagon with other ladies were found out\nAnd just so people could throw things that you and call you name and\nJudge he saw how these ladies were just treated so poorly and she was on a crusade to get homes um made for sporting women wanted to turn their lives around\nAnd had asked um politicians in Nebraska to please contribute to this home and she spent a lot of time trying to I'm a call attention to the societal problem\nAnd was unable to raise the funds in the end and ends up um I Believe are going to Colorado and going back into the trade going back into a profession but you had ladies like Josie Washburn is that this is tragic these ladies some of these don't want ... I don't want to be doing this for what they\nThey want to have a happy life they want to get married but they have had no opportunity in fact\nHe says I'm the men come here because they must have entertainment we're here because we must have bred wow they can get their entertainment anywhere we cannot get bread anywhere\nWe're hungry we're poor and we must have help interesting I appreciate it that there was somebody at that time period of the late Eighteen hundreds who was looking out for late in that profession\nEarlier you said that the houses the bill reviewed were tolerated because they collected taxes from them and they help pay for the police force and I'm sure the schools and everything else\nOne of the things that comes up quite a bit when you're talking to people about why other urban now why it was a woman and everything they indicate that while he was arrested at one time for operating a house you'll refute\nEnd it was true that he operated it it was because the operated however it was really because he did not get the license\nTo run this house and there were other houses in the town but then you need a license and for whatever reason why it would not get the license so it's sort of illustrate so yes how it's it's bad but at the same time we tolerated because it makes his money\nYeah isn't that an ... year you're bringing up the thing about wider being a I'm a pimp as it were right on boy talk about sexism women could get a license to do that here or purpose a man in the trade he couldn't get a license\nI thought that that was very interesting when you think about lighter that's not one of the first things that leads to your mind that he was a head of a brothel at one time\nYou much to break right here Chris and when we come back I Want to talk to you about one of the women there was not necessarily involved with why on earth but one of the women involved wonder why herbs rooms not holiday you got it um\n\n\nBy this was to go to I Would like to talk to you about something special when was the last time you show your ... to that special relatable dear friends because you don't know what to give them well was total to the rescue a subscription to chronicle ... newspaper\nIs the perfect gift everyone is wanting to be a cowboy or town girl with Romney cooler the Old West comprise the reprint articles from\nDee Dee numbers newspapers they all have the experience of the old one year's subscription to chronicle you'll ... like giving gifts and we even include a gift card the best part is it's only\nThirty dollars for you you can order your gift subscription by visiting our website\nChronicle ... mark calling us in the eighties dog Jay\nThings and why don't you give yourself a gift to\nGentler excellent urine treat with the history of the American west better known as the Old West and I'm sure you want to learn more about this time of America's history well we have the perfect place for you to do that\nIt's our own line blog gold cowboy cowboy dot com when you visited cowboy cowboy dot com you'll be able to your audio stories viewed videos and read the latest news about the Old West today that's cowboy cowboy dot com\nIt'll knock your boot salt\nIn\nWill come back to chronicle of the Old West weekly edition mom you're hosting the do the lives\nWe've been talking to Chris Coons about her new book wicked women move towards ... and ... from the Old West\nAnd we touched on point of view but there is one that just intrigues me that we have not touched on and that is dark holidays girl friend big nose to eat now the first question I have to ask\nI've seen pictures of her she doesn't have a big nose\nWell I guess that that you think she does not a big nose gallery I um do you do okay\nI Do think that she has a big nose but I I Believe that part of that um you know they always had a name if you were in that particular ... trade you always had a name that would\nAttract fires let's say um before I talk a little bit about big nose Kate let me just give me an example of that you had a squirrel tooth Alan ... who worked out of dodge city\nIn her claim to fame was not only the fact that she was a prostitute but you had to have something to bring people in the work she has a lot of prairie dog people people called them squirrels but they were really prairie dogs she had a pet\nAnd really put up quite a fuss if anybody teased her prairie dogs or made the mad and um she was prone to taking out a gun and shooting people for doing while but I mean you have people that you have ladies who were in that profession had a\nSpecific um thing that would bring people in that with school to Dallas and she had the prairie dog\nEleanor ...
