office along with Jim Brown and the reporters were all there because Kanye West of the store and jump around a star the wife that when they're given a rip\nAnd Kanye West ended up speaking almost ten minutes kind of a stream of consciousness sometimes they didn't make a whole lot of sense but most of it had to do with his belief that black people needs to rethink their assumptions\nAnd that the police have a job to do a and he did not like the idea of this knee jerk putting out the race card\nAnd he's being hammered call a sellout being caught an Uncle Tom\n\nSo real me this President Trump is a bigger piece of racist because that's why people are he invites Jim Brown and Kanye West into the White House he's ... he's racist and he's a bigger than like black people so it doesn't matter\n\nI look at this a reaction to what kind of you with that and I'm going to talk to you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limits that calling him a token negro when the commentators called him a token negro another one said this is what happens when negroes don't read\nNow calling a black person in equal in the year twenty Eighteen is a slur\nAnd I guess he's black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person the negro and twenty Eighteen is that you know it's offensive\nIt's something that you say when you want to put somebody down because that's what they're doing they're getting away with it it's bigotry left wing bigotry\nAnd Kanye West says he grew up without a father and told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him and it is\nFar and away the number one\nProblem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers\nForeign away nothing else that even close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense far and away and you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what you want at least\nHe gets the big picture he also understands that there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with the biological mother and biological father than\nToday and after slavery because for years it was illegal for slaves to marry it was a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census\nReports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely to be brought into the world where they biological mother in a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency\n... for people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they ask the questions in Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty sixteen\nDo you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to go on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful\nAs so that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at that's a topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea that don't have an opinion one way or the other\nQuote I Know how hard it is to get kids to eat properly but I also know that folks are letting our children drink eight sort of the day which some parents do or you know eat a bag of potato chips for lunch ... by little desk or put that child at the kitchen table watch them do their homework close quote\nWe also need families to raise our children we need fathers to realize that possibly doesn't just in the conception that doesn't make you a father what makes you a
