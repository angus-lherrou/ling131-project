S. A. P. S. H. for it\nUm and then when we dug deeper if you look at it more carefully your allies an ape you gave them every single number that they used in it um and then ask them to calculate what rate would be\nAnd then we work backwards to figure out except we didn't they didn't reveal exactly what the numbers were\nSo we worked backwards to figure out okay what kind of numbers or would you actually need to come up with and what we determined to make it basically alleged that it will cost them about ten billion dollars to comply with one twenty seven and then they did encourage other three point to a billion dollars to close the four corners coal plant\nAnd and that Palo Verde\nAnd uh so when we were looking at okay so you got like twelve years to put in all of those costs we just haven't had to pay about four point five billion dollars of it or a third of it into that last year in order to generate the numbers that the the ... Institute guy and uh so basically they put the closure however already\nCut the closure of four corners and some added cost in there and he put all that in there you got this actually Nineteen hundred dollar bill increase um and of course you don't pay for those things that one year unless you're really cooking the math\nSo over what period of time where the Nineteen ... even estimated about four hundred dollars a year or ... I don't even know where that figure comes from somewhere on why they are I\nCatch it sounded like a power we didn't dig deeply mostly focused on it yet but she's talking about your power has been more um [noise] a reasonable and their estimates are so they they estimate bills will go up about four hundred dollars a year\nAh we estimate it based on what a a residential Utilities Commission\nAnd put it together ... uh which was about two hundred dollars a year and an earlier study that the heightened Institute that great yeah as a tender dollars a year so far hundred dollars a year or might be\nA result there are there are significant complications with trying to integrate a fifty percent so alert or renewable energy into the grid by twenty thirty so that certainly is a much more plausible figure than what it yet and all that\nWell let's talk about the pluses and minuses of more than twenty seven if we say yes and I'm I'm not sure we will ah actors millions of dollars are being spent to tell us\nThat we're all going to hell every vote for this um and of course we know the Phoenix is Harold you're already told us why because that's what we know that for a long time not here for several of truth there is a one of the pluses here are we are we actually going to become more\nEnergy efficient and more reliable non renewable energy if we passed one twenty seven and if we don't\n[noise] uh well what if we don't we don't but what I'll come back that and the fact that if we do have it and I really put a\nA pedal the metal on utilities to really um up the use of renewable uh and as a consequence um you know they'll be forced to really move probably a lot faster than they prefer to move a and a and that\nCould be really a beneficial but it's also going to raise some complications because there's actually no\nOther state that at that level yet that um California is on pace to do that but they only they're only at twenty percent now so they're not at fifty percent so there are a lot of uncertainties related to it and if it were to turn out not to um work we'd have to go back to voters to manage it\nUm but uh but it would definitely put a a priority much bigger priority than we've had currently in terms of our renewable portfolio standards so\nThat would be a reason to vote for it especially if you don't think it airs on a ... a corporation commission is going to do anything a significant\nUp so now to the complications as a constitutional amendment and if you think that the there's been enough pressure now put on or you might think that um the people who might get elected the corporation commission are going to be more favorable to this\nIn November then um they could deal with this issue and a possibly you know bringing 'em added areas because one of the weaknesses one twenty seven is it", "show_name": "4Tucson", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "28"}
