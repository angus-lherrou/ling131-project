there it's always packed with jars containers and stop\nAfter two minutes of moving containers of leftover food some with a science project going on inside\nYou said I Can't find the catch up it's not here then the person who sent you on the mission walked over and grab the catch up from the show right in front of you of course they had to say something like if it had been the snake bitten\nYou just to experience what psychologists call us ... when you said I Can't find anything in the refrigerator you gave your brain the command not defined the catch up\nBecause your brain does whatever its

now let's take a look at this week's show we'll start with a conversation with Tim sweet as he tells us about\nAnd then the second half of the show we'll be hearing from Frederick gallon as he tells us about\nBut first I Want to tell you about a great Old West publication [noise]\nHello this is decode I have a question for you you listen to our radio show when you can you enjoy listening to stories about the Old West you understand the importance of the history of our American West in making the United states the great country it is today but\nWe're from Arizona and obviously that means that there's all type of discussions about why at our ... and then you go to Missouri and you have Jesse James you go down to Texas and you have John Wesley Harding if all of the answers were in black and white\nThat wouldn't be funny anymore part of the fun is being able to say your particular feelings about something and tried to defend it\nWell we have people come in every day that that you know they feel like Billy the kid got away and lived to be a an old man and had a good life and I think that's kind of what everybody would like to see right but I personally don't think that happened now I wasn't there when they shot him were buried him or anything else so\nYou know but we go by their people here that are descendants of the people that helped bury so\nWe have a pretty strong ties to history we've we think history is correct also my grandmother when she was a young girl talked to ... and was told the story\nAnd my father also when he was about eight years old talked to have to seal the who was max was foreman right he was the one that went into the room after Billy the kid was killed and carried him out\nWell I think there were enough people who saw the dead body people ... didn't necessarily have a dog in the race that it would have come out that that wasn't Billy the\nKid so well there were too many people there and you cannot keep that type of thing hush hush or secret you know how people are going to rock that's right right\n[noise] when Billy the kid was here in Fort Sumner and staying I guess one of the buildings at ... place yes why was Pete Maxwell\nNever brought up on charges of harboring the criminal\nWell because Billy the kid would stay with different people that that worked for ... for instance Charlie ...\nLived at the Fort at one time there was a census taken in Eighteen eighty I Believe and it showed that Billy the kid was staying with Charlie ... at the time so he stayed with different ones\nThere so you know I don't think they could really say that\nPete max was harboring you know you know\nI've heard that Pete Maxwell was afraid of Billy the kid\nDo you think there was an element I think after Billy the kid killed the two ... and the law was after a pretty heavy\nAnd as you know that there was a kid was kinda involved with ... who was ... sister right and I don't think Pete wanted Billy the kid around I think he's a little I think he was a little leery of him now\nI also have heard that Pat Garrett was receiving telegrams indicating that Billy the kid was in Fort Sumner and quite possibly those telegrams were sent by Pete Maxwell\nWell I'm not sure of that I Do know that every time that Pat Garrett would come to Fort Sumter looking for Billy the kid he just seemed to be able to slip away and this last time you get it out and didn't let anybody know he was coming into town and uh that's pretty much how he caught up with it\nI've also heard the series that the actual bedroom that Pete Maxwell was in and Pat Garrett was in was Pete max walls sisters bedroom and Billy the kid was coming there\nTo meet with her and he was in effect set up have you ever heard that very\nWell you know I've heard different philosophies and theories about that but what I think took place is a the ... had a rule they basically kill the beef a day for people that live there to Fort could come up and get what beef they needed\nBut the rule was they had to tell ... what they were getting it and I believe Billy the kid came there he was going to getting something to write he was going to let max will know that he was getting it and when he went in there just so happened that Pat Garrett was there what time of night wasn't this around midnight\nNormally about this time Tim I'd say how do you get to your place here the Billy the kid museum but in reality if you were in Fort Sumner you will not miss this place and I'll tell you if you are a student at all of Billy the kid\nYou gotta stop by here see all the memorabilia you even have believed the kid's gun here that we have a\nRifle that Billy the kid gave to a man by the name of ... and we have all the documentation on the rifle\nWe also have jumped tonsils travel case have ...

W. W. dot chronicled in the Old West dot com that's Nicholas deals west dot com colas and eat a tape Donald J\nThinks Jake\nYou're listening to chronicle ... last week we edition I'm Talking with Fred ... gallon ... gallon is the author of a decent orderly lynching it is the story of the Montana Vigilantes Frederick\nThe vigilantes started out with the motive of cutting down on the crime and they eat lynched a few men that possibly would have been\nPaying any way have you gone through trial but that seems like as time went on their standards dropped quite a bit and some of the people didn't even committed a crime\nWell maybe I should start with just a word of explanation about the title was giving a lecture on the evening and\nDuring the question and answer a fell on the front row is kinda agitated and\nWaved his hand around and I called on him and he said there was any such thing as a decent orderly lending [laughter] I realize that they could they says the title is ironic when it comes from a newspaper editor in Helena writing an editorial\nIn the Eighteen eighties uh he he was advocating decent\nOrderly lynching without any\n... or or uncertainty that you could you could have such a thing and I I found it just fascinating that at that point in time I think Americans in the west anyway the east were able to differentiate in their minds\nBetween different kinds of lynching and Montana Vigilantes did indeed start out in ... if you can if you can call it an honorable way um I think the\nThe word sets they've certainly operated in the open they did their business and\nThey write the most famous single day of their careers they hang five men from the cross beam of an unfinished\nDrugstore or the main intersection of the biggest city in the gold rush area of of Montana being with with military precision they didn't\nConceal their faces beneath a ... or or or\nOr engage in any of the photos activity you associate with wind chill in the south or\nSome of the more violent episodes of that you were describing when we got started in our conversation and indeed the old of a victim about power corrupting certainly apply to the vigilantes are within a matter of weeks they had taken to Lynch from people they\nThey couldn't quite agree about whether the targets\nDeserve to be executed they started acting at night they would occasionally uh hang somebody and and have a\nBody swinging from a tree limb in the morning call demand for breakfast at all became pretty sorted I think the standard slipped as well once they hit eliminated people who were\nGuilty of homicide or armed robbery or people who were believed to be genuinely dangerous to the community they moved out of the people who were nuisances I think one important point to keep in mind is that one reason for vigilante justice besides the lack of of government\nThe lack of courts and policemen and the other apparatus for legal law enforcement was there were no prison cells there weren't any jail cells you couldn't walk somebody out and you really couldn't banish\nPeople from the area because in winter any way you couldn't get out of here so really your only choice of this war to execute somebody or not to do anything much so I think that's one reason that paying was\nYou know the it's the ultimate punishment but it was meant to eliminate sources of terror\nYou know there was one vigilante that I'm not sure if he was peripheral are empty was one of the key individuals but ah his name seems to come out I guess in part because he he seemed to seek out publicity and it was John ex by Tiller what happened to him\nWell actually this is a very colorful character and I guess maybe just because of that name acts a fry believe from his middle name Xavier but that's how he was known to want it all he literally shouted his way into Montana history he he was one of the guards in the people's trials first\nFigure who was held and it's quite a remarkable scene where it's getting late in the third day of the trial of a of a man George odds\nWho is accused of killing\nA young a German immigrant and the trial takes place and lives is convicted of killing a a young German immigrants and the self appointed prosecutor calls for his immediate execution and\nFives makes a dramatic\nAnd quite compelling speech right on the spot\nBegging for a reprieve long enough to let them ride home and settled his affairs and he just asked Savage execution put off till election day from the sentiment of the crowd is about to turn in favor of this small humanitarian gesture and ... ... is sitting\nOn a roof watching all this like ... and he calls out\nAsking them how long he gave that determine ... meaning you know how how much mercy did this man showed as a young German boy killed in the crowd turns on a dime is emotions flash and I just let off at the gallows so\nSo that's how our men act a certain south into Montana history and he he's a remains a thick of of a compelling figure simply because he was a bit of a publicity how they're quite a number of pictures of him and he was a tiny little guy it was only about five three so he's posed in many pictures with his rifle which is taller than he is\nHe was responsible for\nOne of the final excesses of the vigilantes that puts them in a bad light and finally finally put them out of business by the lower health\nLynch a child even as Chinese people were called ... ... this particular China and was a popular figure in hell on earth his lynching at the hands of acts by lurk help bring to close the first vigilante you're out here and so they were active for\nSix years they actually had more than fifty people so that's how they managed\nTo get into the record puck handling a vigilante episode in American history\nWe can't leave this subject without talking about and encryption that supports it\nBut on the doors of those who were warned you get out of town it was some numbers three dashed seven dashed Seventy seven was all about\nWell that was one of the first thing that piqued my curiosity or because I I Love her little and I'm One of the few people you'll ever meet has gotten a speeding ticket\nMontana [laughter] I managed to\nGet a little bit over the posted speed limit before they they took that down and I actually had an interesting conversation with a highway patrolman and I noticed that the car door and said we are in the shoulder pads shows the Montana highway patrol have these numbers three seven Seventy seven\nGot curious of course about what they met and they are\nThe mystical numbers of the Montana Vigilantes and folklore has it that these numbers were posted a tenth flapper a sidewalk in front of a target who was\nMeant to be banished they were a warning that if you didn't leave town the vigilantes would destroy you up and show us what do they mean in the park or is that there are a period of time three hours seven minutes Seventy settled faculty okay\nOr the dimensions of a great three feet by several feet by Seventy seven inches and\nNeither one of those explanations makes any sense to me I was never able to find anything and historical record to support them period of time I mean why wouldn't it have been three eight Seventeen for a minute three hours ...", "show_name": "4Tucson", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "08"}
