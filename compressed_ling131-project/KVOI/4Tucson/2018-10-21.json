he's he's moving forward is looking out for the district\nI I've done other ones like the principal at a level high uh he's still on an awesome job over there and all of that school is just rock and so I think I think that uh we are doing some good states\nLet's talk a little bit about the um a district zip future because we're not sure where the sixty million I keep asking your mother sixteen million dollars since they pulled out of a one bedroom and I'm not sure where that's going to compromise ... are you confident the district's gonna get that money from some place\nWell I'm not sure it's it's as far as I'm I'm aware they're still not a definitive that we're going to lose that that my you're talking about the sixteen million dollars a decent amount of yeah right ah I Know that we're still in a\nCommunications with the state and with the county and with the attorney general's office so I'm not sure exactly that's up in the air\nLet's talk a little bit above your priorities are bureau elected again you talked about having a third bird is going to make all the difference as to who becomes a part of the ministry shouldn't have the southerners almost largest school district in where the money goes\nA how comfortable are you that we now have some transparency on what the millions that blow through this district we didn't burn a long time even not not you but the board I didn't have even an auditor for a while and get away with that to how comfortable are you know if there is transparency within the millions of two U.S do\nWell I I Believe that there are hills trying to do that at this point we are looking for a new a turtle auditor or I was really disappointed when our former\nA internal auditor or left he was awesome I'm I'm telling you he was just the greatest thing since sliced bread but uh we uh\nWe made some stupid changes in some of our policies which forced them to re re think where he he needs to go so hopefully we can get that fixed and we can get a good ... a great internal auditor who could keep us on track\nAnd you can be responsible to the board the whole board not just one board member but all five board members to be able to give us great information\nOr you're on TALK so many terms about the discipline problems to USD Halliburton here to serve from public schools ... serious problems how safe business district Kim how do you make it safer because I mean you should be able to\nSend your children to school but you believe is going to be a safe haven as well as the institution of learning it's got a boat\nWell we had a lot of work we do a lot of work in regards to ah bringing ... security into our campus is we spent over a million dollars we're putting in a cameras or doors you can't get in without being busted and they look at you I actually looked at it several times\nAre there still some issues whatsoever height vigor high schools we're still dealing with that but we have security at every insurance they're checking everybody who's coming in so I Believe that we are becoming very very\nSecured in ours a school district\nWithout making it look like a prison\nLet's talk about flight from the district are still a movie theater numbers of students every year and to us do you how do you stop is the attrition this boost the flow of students out of a district ...\nWell I I Believe that part part of the issue is academics we raise or academics we need to get our academics up higher [noise] we need to start this at\nAge third grade and up or even earlier we need to be a gift or or kids more rigor what more regular there they don't want less rigorous I mean they're going to take less regular if we offer them less rigor but I think they can do more of rigor\nIn academics I Believe that providing the teachers with more ability to manage their classrooms now where we have now have the\nAnd it's their classrooms now\nWhere we have now have the new student code of conduct which I met is not the best\nBut it's a hundred times better than what we had a ... or ... you know running running amok in our classrooms and the teachers were like this so other kids are in there who's trying to learn says goes home and tells her parents and they're like okay we're out of here so I think now\nDistrict and ours ours are\nSchools at our teachers have more ability to control and to manage their classrooms and I think that's going to help bring back a lot of the uh people\nRemark is a teacher who's going to call a indoor show and a question mark welcome to the country's not Joel and boom it a
