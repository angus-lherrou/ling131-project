and she talked about the sensitivity about doctor for that she believes something really happened to Dr Ford and as I'm watching this\nI watched it on Fox Fox had a little box in the lower right hand

and you could just tell they weren't happy the way this thing was going and they put their hands over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh on they just looked destroyed\nAnd as I'm watching them and I'm listening to comment I said did you hear anything she said\nWas with what you said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you\nDon't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believes her she believes something happened before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of ...\nAnd since you

is who got her home never came forward and told us who here she was\nAnd so given the background of having all the reputation of Kevin all all the women that are supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where there's no how she got that isn't how she got back didn't tell anybody she said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said it was reasonable she's a
