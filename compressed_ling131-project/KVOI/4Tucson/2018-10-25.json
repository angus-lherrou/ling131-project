fourteen twenty the answer in Cleveland, Ohio\nOr what to talk to you for a second about an issue that you care about more than any other that most Americans do anyway women sitting the pocket books of American families are the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank Luntz\nYou got an earful on this words like greed gouging an unfair kept coming up and a lot of questions why does the cost of drugs keep skyrocketing why the cost of the top ten medications increased over one hundred percent since twenty eleven why does the whole system the all rigged there is an answer\nThe big drug maker spend a lotta money lobbying to protect their profits over one hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact but there is a bigger lobbying America our politicians must answer to we the people and we want solutions to prescription drug affordability and we want them now\nIt's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients at a profit they've law they have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes it's time to end the drug maker monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the ... parents ahead of profits enough is enough citizens for truth in drug pricing\nShare something with your ... the conversation I had this morning that I was reporting for us deputy rule of MSNBC um there's about another forty seconds of it and you did not get to hear that I wanted to do to you to hear the end of the conversation because as you can see\nIt was rather um eventful uh she she is insisting that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling uh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to globalism\nMatter of fact I Wish I had the skewed up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means that's nationalism\nRepresenting the people of the United states first not the people of the world first that's what nationalism is what does it have to do with white nationalism what does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do so I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of the stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the things in a shopping and what your reactions eight eight nine seven months age eight eight nine seven ... seven to for free\nGive this all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is\nThink about the globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given president history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer ... extra careful in his word choices\nI prefer ... extra careful in his works like this especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on your mark right so we're going to agree to wait\nAnd well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not confident and it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth but I Will be able to do is look back many all over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable Smith you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you know you so given all of your economic history the president has largely talking about global or a nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better market\nIs that right now is not not economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president of south it gives you the truth\nThat cat an impact is age and things
