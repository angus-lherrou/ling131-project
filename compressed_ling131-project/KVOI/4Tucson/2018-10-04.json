New York times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engage in something illegal\nWell you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seemed to provide\nYou know there's there are a few things here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places or one of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and uh there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars with the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network has like if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift the or the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that market and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three year two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWatch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus eight four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell or my children sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep\nA hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep\nThree hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nYou see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily say my God how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nReal charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one about\nWell at the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's this or that there's there's a statement that when Donald
