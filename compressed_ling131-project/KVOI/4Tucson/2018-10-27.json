have a nine seven one seven to for three setting fire to the airwaves it's don't Larry Elder show\nThe Mark I'm feeling if Larry Elder of the pain free released factors dot coms studios and as I said with your calls at eight eighty nine seven one saying what you're calling about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to meet somebody on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this is crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's falls and everything goes right like our economy\nIs because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that President Obama he he mentions it all the time off credit calling me that's because of what I started okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin Oh you wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated the left is like the pope\nWhatever the president is for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their signs ready\nThat is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters the hazing and they hate him with a passion you know I thought we reached the uh the top with George W. Bush in their hatred duck this one is being surpass\nThis bumbling fool could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledged the great things that he has done\nSo these acts will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about basically for that didn't last it wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an actress now that's what she's going to probably be in history\nSo it'll just be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think as I said it eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven ones sage\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats they're going to use these acts to their parties in a vantage\nBut for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret but they used to pretend here's the difference that they were non biased no more\nDoes out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate in our elections and the president's right to call them out on this so the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show they always Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that ... that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blame people with ... bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his supporter remembered that who shot a seriously injured Congressman Steve ... and the other cars and he would have wiped the matter if he could but\nPresident Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify us he's no good\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each ... I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump's right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people who are here with me when I've done other shows\nThey said how could you say you know because here's my position if Hillary and bill will agree never don't bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not gonna happen then I might agree not to indict or if I had any power to say about oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat's not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political ask a see\nWhat it's actually like to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out we've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing\nTo see someone taking back to them\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country tell me what you think as I said eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a call or two in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark\nYou're on with mark high margin\nHigh marks a the mark what your upbringing up about a media is absolutely true they don't want to record the fact that the a psycho any prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like oh I don't know the other two\nSo what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up right to work you said a few times during his um or\nNot is candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't said anything like that where\nThe law whether the actual political people or the news\nUh they've all actually said going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so again that's the part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face were you ever see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know during the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOf course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core I Would say you know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing too\nBut they're not going to say than even most of the hard core\nI Would say you know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that react that way if the Trump arrangements so now they could argue that that's what causes it not to that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say
