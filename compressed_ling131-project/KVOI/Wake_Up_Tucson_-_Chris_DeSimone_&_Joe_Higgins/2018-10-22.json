I think so I have a clip of that's going to pull up it's about a minute and a half two minutes long it's by an author her name is Arlene hostile the book is called deep stories of our time and\nUm basically what she did she's at Berkeley professor right and she goes to Louisiana and lives for five years and beds herself in Republican land in red land to find out what's going on as a sociologist trying to get to the root cause of why this tension what is the rise of Trump and it's going to go to a lot of these conversations were\nAdam or a friend of ours I forget who it was was the right before the election was driving through Baton Rouge I mean I hadn't thing and I remember they said they passed wherever Trump was doing his each right and they just couldn't believe it was six o'clock in the morning for four o'clock speech you know and they were lined up outside right and she and she's a Democrat and she's like\nI think this guy's going to win right so that Alexander ...\nAnd the metaphor for the right wing deep story\nThat I described in strangers is that you're waiting in line\nFor the American dream that you feel very much to surf it's like a rating in a pilgrimage into my mind movie\nThen has or fear tired feel your properly deserving of this real bored that's a hat and the idea is you know the crunch any one right right okay this in this\nRight deep story don't begrudge anyone or not a hateful person but you see them a second moment of the right wing deep story somebody cutting had a few big why are they getting special treat and then in another moment\nOr the president of the country Brock Obama who should be tending fairly all\nWaiters in line seems to be waving to the line cutters and he in fact\nIs he a line cutter\nThe idea then okay how did his mother she was a single mother not a rich woman for Harvard education long the education something fishy map and that was the thought there\nAnd so in the final moments someone\nFrom the coast has someone\nHighly educated someone for that so called elite turns around and\nAnd uh if you're really close to the prize or they have the price but they turn around and look at the other two are waiting in line\nAnd said oh you backward southern new educated\nRace is max access to a homophobic ... and then that is that a strange thing to that insult\nAnd that sounds like strangers in real money and they would say one man told me I live\nYour metaphor another one said you read my mind uh another one said no you have it wrong that the people are waiting lender pay for the line concerts and that's why we're in range and others oh look we leave that line we succeed in getting another leader yeah\nThen there's a lot of truth to that and that's why that Tea Party thing that we all son at the beginning of this\nMhm that's what those people they were looking for a voice because they felt like strangers in their own land right this is in the country I was a part of what's going on I'm seeing on the wrong path and we and we were all we all went to these things run Joe you and I spoke to at two of them\nAnd the idea that they're trying to compare those folks who felt like strangers in their own land to the mob of people walking around with the China hats on their head and scraping the doors of the Supreme Court is a huge insult to those ... ... back to insulting that people on the line\nWhen when does the Democratic party realized that dog don't hunt and we're on the wrong\nPath I bring on it and I'm like any other than that they're ever going to get it but is it not working but I Would you keep it out there so committed to the left there so committed to socialist policy as as being eventually the answer that I don't think you'll ever see them come around that's my personal view\nI mean you look at look at the Kennedy Democrat which is more conservative Democrat or the business demographic of Clinton even ran on this he moved to the middle and started talking about economic development and economics row for reform we're going to have to lose ... [laughter] All right well here's the thing they blew it I don't think I'm going to want to you on an American\nNightmare yeah an American nightmare is that all of these tactics right work the American nightmare is all of this stuff Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the way they went after him and all of these little mini things that go on right and all the drama and bull crap rent right at all the fear\nOkay if they win using those tactics American Nightmare mhm yeah\nAll right 'cause now you're you're rewarding horrible behavior right right and you have a press that hates Trump's so bad that they'll they won't say a dying a word about the horrible behavior right right right so whenever\nWe not done that's where I keep going back to that stupid joke I just saw a survey okay and then I remember my analogy used to get those facts ads all the time and then all of a sudden you could get them because they didn't work then usually get emails man really are and that is you kind of get\nDesensitized to the stupid stuff are we at that point is like really really we're not\nWe're not getting paid you don't know this Joe grew up on a he grew up with cow's cattle graze cattle dogs right up in Wisconsin you something to use a a a little milk fact\nFor you on the American they give them and I thank you so I just saw survey yes somewhere between eight and ten percent of American survey a thousand Americans surveyed\nThink that chocolate milk comes from brown cows [laughter]\nThat only comes from round pals we're not adding the chocolate later at a factory or something like that brown cows produce\nHalf of all how to read I Believe in the education and the ... and then in the brain power of I'm actually on my way over being sucked in for a minute no I'm not that is it\nThat that is well it's a it's it's through they were right was it like ... percent or something like that one thing I Know every eight to ten per se eight to ten percent eighty allow even into the eight to ten percent of the people surveyed enough\nThings say that a chocolate milk only comes from ... [laughter]\nOkay you don't sound [laughter] I Know what I now I Know what's going on in this country\nBut we're a center right nation and we kind of happened for a while right when when Nancy Pelosi with Gabby Giffords and the take back the ... of the house did the blue Dog Democrats right what did they run out they ran to the middle they ran an economic points\nYou're seeing it with cinnamon you're seeing this was ... and they're not running out goofy lefty they're running to the center of the middle so we're center middle country so what point do we date is the Democratic party realized this dog don't hunt man and I agree with you this is that I got all these yeah this is a big fat wide election in the house yes but if it's close\nI START I think you start thinking about how do we went in\n... engineered two thousand six after the Bush fatigue and it was by running blue dog Democrats Gabby Giffords being one of them\nSo look at a Garcia in cinema in this day and age of

I look at the people who have run in the last couple of years\nReally good people Margaret Burke holder Kelly law and these are good people running for this thing rather how many times we look to change the voting process and they're going to have but that's why I'm Single I still I've given up right that's what I read in the Republican Party should just say no we're not run and I'm Renee who started legislator count the paint member all that stuff so so that's where you're\nTaking with as sales sees as healthy as a nonpartisan organization but the reason that we know that we need to work with all the policy makers that are in the seats and so that's why I Will continue to be a nonpartisan organization because having that access to having the discussions and sitting down and change\nIn this direction you mentioned it the cameras on the brake are on the air it's going to be slow\nIncremental if at all you know sometimes I can see already started oh well I got to let the fact of the matter is gonna be alive is this is very much in our society now we've got too many people that are willing to throw their hands up in the air sure and just say forget it I mean and you're seeing that both on the the D's and the ours right now about talking about not coming out and voting\nBecause they don't like who the party picked in the primary\n... head I'd like to I mean if you get the ah you're adding machine out real quick I write\nSo I Want I Want to do I get my calculator you know it's I always knew something rather started out the ... All right let's do it so we take the amount of ... the access alright times the rate of things getting changed okay\nAnd then we talk about the word on a city wide uh we will see change by the by the

will decide for you as the and the market will decide for this time it's just a market decision right into the heart and they don't get your right and it's your home resale value it's a ... coffers going into the tax alright here let's go back to the perfect point\nLet's get real quick we are going to talk about citizens initiatives and one of the things when when we're talking about what Joe affair you set a very interesting comment which is there's one way we should make them harder\nBut then also make them easier what did you mean\nBy that well it's you know the citizens initiatives just to me and I you know\nAnd like one of the earlier callers I've only been in Tucson since the Nineteen Ninety nine a but it seems like in the last several years we've had just an influx of legislation through initiatives right or some of it's being sent down to us you know by by the legislature 'cause it's it's some of the tough calls that's on the things they can't do but\nThere's so many things that have made the citizens' initiative inside Arizona the way that we are going to legislate and what I mean by there are a lot of people in the ... in the state that feel it should be harder to put him on the ballot that way only be really truly important things but my argument against that is that means only the people with a lot of money including outside interests will get them on the ballot\nBut we also need to make them easier and that is for true Arizona and in citizens to have a say citizens' initiative was something\nIn two thousand or a Nineteen eleven and we tried to become a state and were denied by the federal government it was for two reasons one we had this thing called citizens' initiative aunts that initiatives in our constitution and the other one was because we had the ability to recall judges\nWriter and they didn't like that well\nTook a year to smooth some of the rough spots that in our constitution but citizens' initiative state and if you look at the map of what states have citizens' initiative they're almost all western ride ... it is truly something that occurred in the Eighteen sixties to to throw in the early Nineteen hundreds saying we\nA little bit of we don't trust our government we want to make sure the citizens of the of the state have seen it\nBut over the time it's it's it's more if we had a hundred and Ninety nine citizens' initiative since Nineteen twelve a lot of them have affected everything from mandating spending to how we can vote\nTo who how ... can run for public office and matter of fact fifty percent of our state legislator spending down to the budget is voter mandated through citizens initiatives so\nThere's no good answer if you make it real harder it's going to be big money interest ... probably big money interest from outside the state that come in you know we know we're probably face another uh initiative on legalization of recreational marijuana soon because there's a lot of money behind that movement\nThroughout the U.S and they can do that we've had another version or read for it's going to come around ... absolutely and and so it is one of those things where\nIt's a fine line I don't think is a state we want to eliminate them hard of our history part of what we want to do but at the same time um\nYou know maybe maybe it's a combination of reducing the number of signatures that really enforcing the strict compliance\nSo what's the negatives right now than you think uh in the the citizens process well all the negatives how can we counter them in the future\nThere's two things that I see it being a big problem one is the fact that it there's no difference in the state of other than the number of signatures you have to get\nThis is the fact that it there's no difference in the state of other than the number of signatures you have to get there's really no difference in the state between a constitutional initiative which you can change the constitution embed something that which makes it very very difficult\nProposition of sorts with the number one is that exactly\nAnd we're put so therefore when somebody comes into the state particularly with outside money which means there's gonna be a lot of money to gather the signatures 'cause you know paying paying for signatures is something that occurs just does a\nThat's problematic to me because\nYou see stuff being put forward to the constitution that doesn't belong there such as tax policy right and\nOn prop one to seven which that sale season adamant no against we're putting energy requirements this energy the way we can get our energy is changing dynamically year to year yet we're going to bed it in our constitution that saves says what type of energy we have to use for ever\nSo what's the pushback on 'cause if it's a citizen initiative right if you're going to pay a company so many ah dollars per signature does that take away the idea\nOf a citizens' initiative ... what it does it doesn't take away that ideas says initiative what it does is incentivize is the person gathering signatures\nTo I'm not tell the full story about what you sign it I mean you know where we get hit there's there's this a\nSlide that we we had one of our presentations on is an issue that said you know basically I can I talk to you for a second are you a Democrat and the answer from the uh other character in the slide was it depends what one would get me out of having to talk to you and signed what you're asking me right so so it's really in that way\nIt's taking away from the idea that the citizens are the ones behind this\nIt's really not about whoever can gather the signatures grassroots efforts were you know the ... the people that we know in our friends with that they're heading out signatures in each gather may only collect twenty five a hundred signatures that's different than something when you're just inserting paid circulated providers and gathering you're required two hundred and fifty\nThousand is an unbelievable amount of out of state money that comes in to pay for the prepaid and shove the some of the stuff down your throat\nThat's exactly what we're talking about here because if you look at both one twenty six\nWhere uh the national association of realtors invested in gathering signatures then you look at one twenty seven where an outside California billionaire came in I mean one twenty seven forty million dollars are going to be spent his life is spent is being spent on prop one twenty seven forty million is now leads among repeal it is now the largest\nThe largest financed\nVote for and against initiative in the state of Arizona in ... and it's been and forty million in six months how much do you think they're going to get back\nIn the next ten years yeah and there there's a lot of things that have been that way so it it's\nI Wish we had an answer Chris but\nSo here's a question for you um if I was going to look at if there were good changes made in trying to make a citizens' initiative more pure okay what was it a more pure um campaign finance report look like who would be the the the ... it would have just be citizens stroking checks\nTowards that and local groups would have been at that point what happens is the ... the national groups can feed it through the\nLocal group so what does that how does that how was how would you make that\nThat's the challenge of of your money drives everything in politics it it it it just doesn't so that's the challenge is is there a way that you can put that outside funding can't come into the state the answer is probably no 'cause like you said they'll funneled through local grocer\nYou can do is making all these goalie individual contributions and that's the only that's the only I think that's the only way you can really minimize agree\nAnd if it's a citizens' initiative that may be a valid\nPoint unless you are a citizen it's coming from individuals you cannot fund the the the the camp but maybe not even the campaign but at least the process up to getting the initiative on on there because the fact of the matter is these outside interests have had no qualms saying who's funding\nI write one twenty seven it's very clear where the money's coming from\n'em and they're not afraid of doing it because in their their mind I heard I heard one of the cause was\nTheir belief is while they they've got all the money to do it they're really got that national level perspective of each day well remember we are a United States of America were republic right at and we we've given up some of our control in our state despite trying to keep it through things like substance initiatives in our constitution\nThis one twenty six what's so interesting of all the calls that I've gotten about the ballot propositions right with the questions but the charter school one people are still trying to figure that one out okay the citizens of clean elections one they're still trying to figure that one that uh they're beautifully written I fit sarcastically right ah but one twenty six\n[noise] this is what I get cars on my recommendations I'm a no one one twenty six I don't where are you going to sale season on one twenty six as well so what happens is they go to the whip open their guide right and they see one of the other arguments against it is state senator Steve Farley even my mother called me up and said\nAll right I Love you but you got to call me up and please tell me why you in the Farley or agreeing on this proposition ... and the number one call I've got\nOne on one twenty six though I mean a state our ... our state representative and potentially our state senator or Vince leach very small government very no tax person he's opposed is when you're ... college both\nOpposed to the to the same initiative something's wrong with the guy ... come out against it it is putting one it's a solution\nLooking for a problem the problem doesn't exist right now it doesn't there's no move in our state legislature we have two thirds protection\nTwo thirds vote required to increase any tax so that's protected and you have to get through a governor's signature right but what you were doing is you're saying tax policy should be part of the constitution instead of tax policy being determined by our legislatures in our elected representatives if it gets\nWhen I was talking with as you said David Oppenheimer [laughter] as when I when I had discussed one twenty six with him at one of the uh one of the public forums\nIt gave him an aha moment 'cause he said so\nThis release forces us to a direct democracy\nVersus a representative republic and we'll represent a republic we elect our elected we've used the line before with you the government we've got the government we want because the government we vote for and if we get away from that and try to take everything to an individual boat we've we've lost what the core of our country\nAs we come back I wanted to ask you talk to you a little bit about the the ... the legislatures ability to kick things to the proposition I don't know if that's really good thing either I\nHold on a whole lot Ted Mack hotter than our leadership council or you're listening to the ten thirty ... at Alexander spending the soon\nWe're kicking off Monday we've we've got a chock a block of today for Monday
