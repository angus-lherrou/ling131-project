was watching a little bit of this debate with your fellow congressmen\nMr ... looks like he was going to fall asleep on the podium but he is the first thing out of his mouth and why he needs to be returned to be reelected back to the house is the evil tax cuts OK and now all of a sudden he's a big deficit hawk and he cannot believe\nThat there's the seven hundred million dollar deficit can you explain to play folks even with economic growth the way it's going why is there a deficit because this is one of the big you want fake news that's the one that the Albert hall the thing that\nIt's that thing and ... and also um bunch of the Democrats now are pro free trade\nBecause the president as you know is adopted slightly more the Democrats yuan trait right and give the trade skeptical so um yeah if it's black it must be white yeah it's All right\nThe number and I will get this for next week because I I've tried to get\nBack in D.C okay I'm In the vast majority of the yeah\n... ... excuse me up the deficit this year the other shortfall this year is actually in is to program Social Security and Medicare\nAnd that's really uncomfortable for folks to talk about that and it was the tax reform but once again the tax reform was going to cost one point or cruel you know over ten years right\nThe gross from it has been dramatically higher than we expect it so it turns out things like like it you know your Social Security or payroll Medicare taxes have come in from medical higher than we expected salt and said now we have a positive those accounts\nRight like if you actually in ... where's the shortfalls come from a big chunk of it is was to step up making up the ... military\nBut the Democrats so yes ... wants to play what was structural on the tax reform it's actually finally growing the economy\nSo we have the chance of having a much bigger ... because we're ... ... if it continues over the next few years we can have a much larger economy\nBut also because of the sixty votes of wrestled them Senate we had to put a bunch of stuff in there also correct to that's why there's a lot more spending also\nNow a lot of that that the spending team I'm an avid ... objects and what not and the tax reform\nI mean I'm just on the budget I mean on the budget said\nOh yeah yeah in the budget because there's you know there's a lot of members and the president said we need to pick up I'm a maintenance issues and those in the military well because the sixty vote rule in the Senate for every dollar you want to put in the military you got to put a dollar and to\nTalk about real quick and we keep I always we for years we keep hearing infrastructure infrastructure we see you know inner states that are falling apart you know I remember the John Oliver thing about how many bridges or blow you know are basically\nNot so great in this country so tell me where where where everyone says infrastructure is there any chance of any infrastructure deals bill ... yeah what what were we out with a\nTrip I say it's all about financing right um gas tax\nOnly raises a faction of what people actually think at that\nAnd now the cars and trucks have gotten so efficient now that you start to see the electrification of so many vehicles\nUm gas taxes are functionally flat some areas reaches the country they're actually going down so you're going to have to think about how do you find new infrastructure particularly world weight infrastructure\nUm and then you have to deal with every other group think what you want to watch your damn well we want you to do this flood control project we want to re we want you to do so you you you now have to fight through all the special interests\nBut I Know Trump piled ... proposed the idea of matching funds for what a local community comes up with is that a good way to do this\nYeah they may be that it may be also a combination of bats mail to have you with lots of different silos of revenue um something that maybe you take energy leases and bond that money\nAnd then use the energy at least the the suffering from that um energy production to pay off the bond there's we actually have a whole plethora of mechanism 'cause you can't do it like we did fifty years ago twenty five years ago of well\nWhat kind of finance it through some general fund revenue\nAnd the gas tax it's just not enough money gotcha okay\nAh I had a couple of quick questions for you then I got to actually end our conversation because I Am and bumping you for the\nPresident I Know I Know I\nBeen from so [laughter]\nUh one of the uh state propositions in Arizona this year do you find particularly offensive real quick\nBut this year do you find particularly offensive real quick\nYeah\nThank you [laughter] oh I mean\nLook I think actually in some ways are all the understandable um what's striking is like on on on something like ... um I you see some of the rhetoric around it and going oh come on\nIf you get a little nervous that some of the folks that took the ... the state passed legislation referred it to the ballot\nWhat's the ultimate motivation ... to ...\nYou were nervous of having certain people show up in your school district because they know those parents are so choice\nUm you're you're you're hoping that the motives are truly all altruistic and not sort of targeted on 'em ... potentially poor people who might want to take advantage of parental choice right okay\nSo you're you're you're you're you're ... you're in now on that or are you at all you know I guess you're yes on three oh six yeah I I\n... I support what we know that still fought\nThree or five I Apologize tell me about once before we go one twenty six the thing that's no tax on a service ever again what do you have\nIt's not uncommon do on a\nPersonal this one I struggle with a little bit because I'm not comfortable really doing tax policy through the ballot box in the actual you plug it into the constitution and look this partially comes 'cause I used to be the church or to because they all in the\nCounty treasurer for Maricopa um what happens is Twenty years from now the economic base here is much more technology and services\nRight what it means is even higher sales tax base which is the majority of their revenue get shifted in ... it was small portion of the economy um it would be very hard to sort of balanced access correct\nWell sir I'm I'm going to a thank you for everything that you do good luck and all your reelection stuff we love when you call every Thursday\nOh it is at least I bake if if you're out their mail your ballot in um you know folks that it it ended up sitting on the ballot kill it because I don't think they realize how much money goes into chased\nThe again that we keep saying that there have been our mind for for the last week since last Thursday is you got a pop it and I got I got candidate saying what can they do I like go figure out and get these people to vote these Republicans because of the\nLook if you go to the New York times whole you know called white poll go Google that and take a look at what's happening in the U.S Senate race with Sally cinema\nAnd ... they have a one point right now over some gun but if you look down into it you notice that we have a more normal turnout\nUm ... wouldn't buy a lot right it's just they're all modeling that a bunch of Republicans aren't going to mail the ballots second\nAnd Alexander play an annoying song that's been a David Schweikert on the road\nMaybe break your heart\nHave a good day buddy seven twenty seven

... leather furniture ... furnishings from old Mexico finally granted in ...\nI think the dynamic of the Republican Party has changed I mean I think\nI think the Republican Party under my father had tremendous backbone um they're willing to fight and and I think he's been a great leader in that way Lindsey Graham was incredible I mean what he did there was nothing short of extraordinary um it was passionate smart um you know um it was it was quite emotional\nUm but but Lindsey Graham was was was amazing because look at that just a shame that the whole hearing was I forget about that the second half of it was for it but if the first half\nAnd you know cabinet goes he sits down on the first day of of testimony he said it's been nine thirty in the morning the Democrats you know they're they're all running for you know for president on that stage you know your Spartacus up they're giving you know these you know long winded speech is\nKevin I didn't get to speak his first words until three thirty in the afternoon I mean\nI don't care what side of this thing you're on I don't care for you know a a Supreme Court justice that comes in as a Republican or Democrat that's not what Americans want to hear I mean Americans want to hear the actual confirmation or you know the maybe the largest job interview when the world that they want to hear from from the nominee\nYou know so so this grandstanding and that was taking place on the bench that lasted what seven hours before the guy got to speak for ... the whole thing was a circus and\nUm everybody should condemn it and uh and I'm really glad the Republicans had the backbone to stand up to uh to the nonsense\nAnd my last question is do you think the Republican Party is doing a good enough job could telling America that all of this economic\nUh all the economic benefits that's going on right now is in Milwaukee about a month ago and their unemployment rates off the wall the housing markets rocking and this is a state that flip for your dad off of two years of Obama\nAre we are we doing are we doing a good enough job selling that to the people that that's my dear\nChris what I tell you that you know I people come up with all the time and say hey I'm you know I I've been a lifelong Democrat I open my four one K. the other day and and and I am voting for your father and perfect ... he I mean it's incredible it's allowed me to you know\nTo retire a few years earlier and I like I I I hear stories like this all the time would I Would I sincerely hope and people ... and people see it and people credit him with in America to us you know the coastal media might not but America absolutely does\nWhat I said surely hope is that there is there's no complacency where hey is the world's great we're doing well the economy's rock and ask it continue I don't need to go out and vote because it doesn't matter that couldn't be further from the truth I mean\nThe Democratic party will do everything they possibly can and they will shut down the walls they will they will try and teach\n'em ... and they will create mass hysteria at every juncture or they will subpoena they will vis they will that I mean they will do everything they can to bring in this country to its knees and it can happen and so this election is just as important in a certain way as as twice sixteen because without the house without Congress\nUm we can't do what what's what's been done and um people have to get out there and felt I mean by not voting you're effectively voting against him you have to go to the polls especially in a state like Arizona which is just just so critical I mean just so critical\nEric thanks for the time today hopefully we can do it again in the future I look forward to Chris and I try to look through

going to play more tiny Sam ... thanks hurting\nA couple of her most most annoying what's your hands on top of the car okay we're playing\nAnnoying songs\nThat the Phoenix police department could play on their Ninety five thousand dollar ... sound system wow that there requesting money from the city council of Phoenix four\nAnd a couple of the more sensitive ah counsel people are having reservations about not because of the Ninety five ... it's because of they feel as though the cops may use it as a punishing\nTorture device playing songs like what do you play correct this morning ... so I put it on Facebook Tuesday and we got like forty five responses with people saying here's some songs you could use the torture criminals\nSo that's what we're doing um I Know there's there's three things we want to cover today in relation to the future of what's going on with the surgery to green chamber green valley chamber of commerce so let's first in a let's talk about strategic plans stuff first\nEarlier this year we have some really wonderful I mentioned we have Eighteen corporate partners one of those is Freeport background and they constantly are investing in a dump programs that\nHe'll make sense I have longevity and uh and and and matter and one of those is we just felt like it was time to make sure that we were aligned and had a you know the right mission statement the right uh uh things that we needed to focus on is\nIt mission statement the right ah ah things that we needed to focus on his chamber uh the days of the chamber doing a you know simply parades and mixers and uh and you know networking opportune hold on I think I Wish we had ... yeah\nWe need more parades I'll disagree I Need for a while there's ... there's and and those are fine but today a small business people are faced with so many major challenges that are never used to before and\nAnd we we know what all the national research says we know that we can go on the website and find that out or you know all the law but we want to know what our business people really need and\nUh one of the things that are reporting ... did in addition to to aligning us by the way our new mission statement is championing opportunities for business and and our community to prosper and prosper means different things for not for profit is how many people we we serve\nOffer the small businesses are making sure that you're paying your employees in your products and and yourself and and you know paying for the insurance and all the things you need all your number one challenge that you hear from your your uh it's one of those three things you and I will talk about which is health insurance affordable health insurance that's the number one thing nationwide\nOh hello we have something called the Affordable healthcare act or ... no nap that said uh so you're saying that um basically two months ago the president a kind of the executive order yes that uh associations could have a little more freedom and doing a group plans yeah there's a the the\nOne thing that a ... among the things that are challenged ah for small businesses affordable healthcare and for them and their employees and they don't get the same advantages larger companies do to be able to invest in these\nPrimo products of you know of a dental medical and\nAnd a vision insurance and and they can't offer their employees that same thing well a President Trump made this a possibility so associations can now and chambers of commerce offer health care to a a a Ford will healthcare on ... on a group basis\nTo their members and so we've gotten together with eight other chambers of commerce in southern Arizona and we'll be rolling out on next ... next month\nThe opportunity for small business people to\nUh have a affordable health care that's free from some of the mandates or that the ADA has and ah and up in Nevada Clark County for example you can go to this and get more information they\nThey actually in Clark County have fought three of their chambers of commerce have gotten together again down here we are going to have an eight or nine a and they're providing a savings of roughly Fifteen Percent off of health insurance for other people and small business in over two hundred businesses have already signed up in less than three months\nSo uh we're excited about that that's one of the first things that were excited about we're going to be doing I'm as part of the agreement of with a ton of sorry to a business retention and expansion survey and that's something else at the the free poor ... people have funded\nAnd we're going to go out and conduct a minimum of twenty five businesses and salary than twenty five in green valley a upfront and personal you know one on one survey not the survey monkey stuff those are good but we're going to get get down in the weeds and find out from our small business partners\nYou know what do you need to do your business better and then we're going to customize what we do as a chamber again the praise are great and that kind of stuff but we want to really deliver a value uh and and help and expertise to our small business partners\nTell me about the and the old days um fire firebrand Randy Graf was very active in the public policy committee yes is that oh you guys still doing that kind of stuff\nWell a ... yes and I'll say a kind of a guarded yes you know we\nYou know we do some government relations in a you know things that are of what we're hearing strongly like for example this one twenty seven\nA prop one twenty seven is something that a universally we're hearing is just going to be bad for just about everybody imaginable fry and ah we're having some serious conversations at the chamber about whether we want to uh uh come out against that in a number of chambers across Arizona a I'm a ... a vast majority of chambers have come out strongly against that\nI Would say the only chamber they should come out against come out for it would be the green chamber possibly ah other than that yeah maybe even arrogance that I didn't even know I'm just I'm stereotyping the green chamber of people\nBut we're we're careful because we have you know we're representing a very as I had set a very broad expanse of of all kinds of businesses and and kinds of people that were serving and uh so we're careful about what we come out swinging the bad on um I I've course Randy would ah would\nAsk all either new board chair we're excited about that but right now he as he wants us to to to come out and take strong stands and uh again we we want to do so but we want to be careful and making sure that we understand all aspects of every issue before we do that\nI Would now let's get back to parades because you are my thing that ... to green valley needs to work on okay is really special events that are a little more attractive and more publicized to folks outside of the area\nYeah you know our biggest event of the year as a country fair white elephant a parade and one of the largest parades in the country\nAnd that's going to be happening on the Saturday a next Saturday a and and that's that's really a blast to watch but we have we're having more cutting edge things for example ... the doctor George Hammond from the University of Arizona has come down and talked about what's going on with the economy in southern Arizona\nIn our region a there is another guy by the name of ... who is one of the founders of constant contact\nHe's going to be speaking on November sixteenth about digital marketing and social media\nAre so we're trying to bring a more things of of great value to the business community and the community at large but you know larger events are we also have branded the region between\nAh know gallons and uh the crossing and I tend to nine Nineteen eighty nine teen and we call it the other southern Arizona\nAnd ah we're a partnering with the southern Arizona\nA arts and culture alliance to do events or next year\nAh we also hope to get more involved with al ... Tucson and know that there's talk about uh the possibility of veiled who are wanting to expand a one or two of their races down south and we'd like to play host and one of those in the future so we're actively are going to be involved in the race this year was a hope to attract\nThat Victoria steals true comprehension of issues in relation to the government\nWould be about the size of a tomato let's go tomato okay Randy fleenor in relation to his comprehension and intelligence on the issues is about a very he's about twelve he's about twelve pounds ...\nThat's the difference so the Arizona Daily Star one that they don't even mention on a Henderson exists is hilarious okay and shows how much of a bunch of Democrat ... they are number two to say that\nI'm Randy fleenor a bill number one such cherry tomato okay in relation to knowledge of issues and things like that\nFleenor\nAgain twelve pounds pumpkin to some variety of tomato for Victoria Steele now I'm going to tell you something

and then I'm just telling you ah\nYou know on a ... a member of for her you on a single shot heard\nYou're a don't vote for it they'll say up to to just vote for one but here's here's the crowning achievement of the endorsements today\nFirst of all we have David they talking about David Bradley okay and he's running against Marilyn Wiles now David Bradley is one of those guys who when he was on this show two years ago and I asked him the most\nPressing issue in the state of Arizona\nHe said more dental care for children that was his number one pressing issue\nHe's laser focused that David Bradley laser focused on dental care so I don't know what kind of fluoride spending his water now\nNow we have um so he chose her him over I'm Marilyn Wiles\nShe's a smart lady she is really good\nI like their lines about David Bradley he believes in the long term approach the legislation which is mean wait ten more years to the Democrats take over the legislature and he might do something to keep re electing me keep re electing mean keep re electing me that's what it means\nMarilyn a his opponent Marilyn Wiles is a former federal government worker who runs her own consulting she has a conservative who says it's time for St ... but here the her she's quote fell short on her ideas refreshed but fell short on specifics\n\nBradley has fresh ideas any ideas players you know maybe it might be a nice guy but I'm not saying these bad guy I remember him sitting near as as a lump in okay\n\nDavid Bradley has fresh ideas any ideas plus you\nHave it might be a nice guy but I'm not saying these bad guy\nI remember him sitting near as as a lump in went okay you know maybe maybe you got something upstairs but you don't have any gr is my new that but anyway but now we have the representatives\nSide which is Claude filters race and there's two days right you've got this Christian angles are already there and then the amazing you guys know this guy Domingo the garage or you\nKnow Domingo right\nAd sounds familiar I'm just getting ... other than he has the same name as Ted right so a neat and attorney working in foster care and the department of child safety shares many of the same concerns including gun safety and judicial reform that's frightening okay\nNow here's the best part is the one that I Love about the the main go well 'cause I like to call them dum dum da garage sale okay\nNow this is the Arizona Daily Star endorsing dum de ... over caught filter okay on public safety issues the ... a Democrat\nSaid law enforcement should be properly funded not only to be well trained and well equipped quipped but also as part of support from the community that will help keep them in Arizona instead of joining departments elsewhere now\nThis is the fun part right this is just like me talking about a buck foster in the first hour saying that he's a big journalists that asks questions\nHere's the Arizona Daily Star in door seeing this Democrat because he says law enforcement on the state level should be properly funded\nAnd Alexander\nOne was the last time you saw the Arizona Daily Star\nSarah fit see ... or any of these folks are of course the little Timmy stellar right all of that folks Joey Joey Joey ... reported report supposedly some sort of a reporter now\nWhat are the any of them mentioned that the city of Tucson is has a under funded
