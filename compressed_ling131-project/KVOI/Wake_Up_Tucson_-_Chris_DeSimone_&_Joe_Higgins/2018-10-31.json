people to say is a costume from your Halloween past that you remember maybe have a good story about what what do you what's the what's it Halloween costume that you remember from the old days\nSo I Would not say a well one that I made for my oldest son so it was actually his costume\nYou want it to be ... so they made him into it when he was in kindergarten super adorable um unfortunately we

then I have this little bean bags they kicked the throat and he\nMean getting so what you're saying okay so here I got to thinking about this when you dress up as a target that good at people throwing stuff that you write yet you didn't realize this is preparing to run for city council in that primary you didn't realize that\nWell that's right that it said\nThose little kids were poll during a throwing being [noise] um so you filed paperwork recently to uh to run for office is this true\nYes it is true I have a link to run for a district three and twenty twenty\nFour district three county supervisor correct\nNow a that has been held by a lady for quite a few years over two decades now why do you think she needs to be a be thrown in replaced\n[noise] well I actually heard word um when I was running for city council and after I didn't quite have a successful right there yeah that might be retiring so I started thinking about it that I'm going to be honest I haven't had a chance to talk with sharing in person\nI've been busy running around and I haven't made the time to speak with her um but I Am concerned for example\nWith the whole vote on saving golden ten lanes you're not eating golden lanes right so that I mean not coupled with the notion that I had that she was retiring I thought I could do this job than because my mother had adjusted to me I thought oh other people have faith and meet you sell them for it\nSo if somehow she says she's going to run for the seat are you going to not run for the seat at that point\nYou know at this point I'm I'm going to sell them for the seat just because we've been working um to try to save golden ten lanes and\nI'm just not getting a lot of support from her office unfortunately\nSo when have you talked to her office before\nYeah we did talk about this as a possibility um I've taken golden ten lanes and having it lengthy parks and rec she said she thought it was a good idea\nNow my group and I we've gone to end the call to the audience several times and we've spoken up and we've asked for help and she hasn't reached out to me so\nAs if I was to be in a citizen and somebody had come to me and said hey Felicia I'm concerned about this and they came to call to the audience several times and they said I'm not exactly sure what to do I would at least have somebody from my office to reach out and say\nThis is what's going on but there's been nothing there's no communication and that really concerns me\nSo if someone who has spent a lot of time in in with the the regular folk a living and breathing and dying and sweating in the flowing will area yeah what um what are some of the basics you think the county's failing on other than the bowling alley view think to make life better for those folks\n[noise] [noise] well um I was just out of school and wells can any neighborhood meetings and some of these things might be more city issues um well I think they're also relevant to the county so for example having the economic opportunities\nUm in that area um I've talked to a few before that Jacobs park and just kind of revitalizing that area the whole miracle mile area in Manhattan known a reputation for not being a very nice place and what really what\nA ... for not being a very nice place and we're really working hard to try to help with the economic vitality city and ... area revitalization projects and we've been working with Rebecca ... she's been supported that unfortunately again from the county which is not getting very much\nThe what are some other things that have you got into that seat you would just so basic stuff that you'd like to see the county do better overall\nWill definitely our roads and we know that if you go to certain areas the roads are a lot better and when you think about it when there's the potholes and things and you're driving dangerously to try to save your car\nThat you don't have to have problems and that's the next second addict also with transportation I'm I was at a packed meeting recently with the ... study and and I think that we can do more coordinating between the county and I've also heard out um\nAnd that whole John nation with us last rain\nThere were the roads were impossible so we need to make improvements not just to the people who have the money that's the other outlying areas as well\nAnd a house or do you go you're doing your monthly walks to um to golden pins how how would how are those events going\nSo those are still Neal I'm there there's not a whole bunch of people who come I'm hoping that more people will start\nTo come out and that we're there every first Saturday of the month and we'll start\nEating up at eight o'clock and then we walk at nine thirty just to help and to stomach domestic violence um it's kind of an education um\nProgram as well talking to folks about enough to violence and how can we change the culture but the hope is everyone coming out to the walks we're going to start changing the culture the whole community together\nAnd how do people find out more about you and your your your your budding a Pima County supervisor a candidacy\nSo they can go to the website which is that your W. W. dot ... dot com um and then there's just a drop down and then then you can look at the can just see or you can look up the projects and the work that we're doing like example we're going to have a fundraiser on friday\nOver at the golden ... um to help answer stomach and has to balance out the six thirty\nOkay well good luck with everything and we'll keep in touch over the next uh all these

Tucson plays up to the west would look a lot him and his wife Katie okay a very good and so he produced it that's all his kind of he added a lot to it anyways\nUh so when you in a so last time we we ... we went up before we went to break we\nPulled Marietta the ditch twelve inches of snow between Lourdes Bergen damning\nAnd the worst thing was when we got here right so we get here we go to move into the into the apartment threat and our water bed was frozen [noise] now people don't remember this today I mean you know people don't have water beds right so we uh we uh you know we didn't have a bed to sleep in the first night 'cause it'd frozen and\nCracked and all that kind of stuff so we went down the next day you are clients that I found out about better nights to water beds you remember that the air and nice to have all that adds to water better nights to water better than I ever that are okay yeah and they around along the lines are no water beds anymore but we go down there\nAnd the water but yeah and and I had a company car I didn't know I had a company car but I got here\nAnd there was a it was ... it was an old Plymouth and she goes it'll be fine she goes just don't drive it over thirty five I go well this isn't good so I go to put the water bed in the Trump open up the trunk at the water bed store\nAnd there's no truck it's rusted out it's gone and so this is a client right so I'm Out there trying to represent the station which at the time was ... six Ninety am right that was our first station so it was a little bit embarrassing\nAnd that was what was the format when you got there\nIt was Christian talk in music okay I was half Christian talk and half music and uh it was it had been put on the air by a couple of businessmen here in town Dan Carlos and Joe dial up and then they gave it to their church grace chapel\nBut it was a it was it was a mess they when they bought the station none of them knew anything about radio and so they overpaid for the station and the guy that sold it to him some people may remember Alvin corn gold oh yeah it was a long time broadcaster long time or attorney\nAnd uh he got a good deal on the deal because he charged them a million dollars for the station they got no equipment no land middle\nMoody like in the eighties or nineties was in Nineteen as you're white Israeli W there is no well you go out and this man he was good been meant\nIt anyway [laughter] you been in math but anyways he uh he got I'm pretty good and then when he told them he says look you don't want to own the tower site it's too much trouble he goes I'll own it and he goes I'll give you free rent [noise]\n[noise] well that lasted for a year or two Tilly sold K W F ... and the tower site a dentist be him member Dennis I work for that is the over when I got here it's a sign you know I mean that we had a now all of a sudden we're paying Fifteen hundred bucks a month tower rent and Dennis be hand calls me gets Doug\nYou got to come and see me he had like a Chicago accent you remember Dennis he goes raspy yeah he goes\nI'm going to raise your rent [laughter] why are you going to raise my rent and if he goes because you'd gotten a lease [laughter] it's a month to month lease so I go on I see Dennis\nAnd I go you know look I just got here we're trying to get out of the whole we're losing Fifteen thousand dollars a month we owe the IRS payroll taxes Seventy five thousand dollars the sack ask Cathy BMI we owed them all night and he goes what what are you gonna do you're going to beg me\n[noise] I go yeah if I Need to beg us I'm not going to raise your right [laughter]\nAnd Dennis Dennis ... came ... one of my mentors him and Jim Sloan when there's a young guy I'm twenty nine years old I didn't know no much at all\nAnd Dennis guided me through things so when he sold his stations he called me said Doug you need to buy this tower site\nI go I got no money I don't know I Can't buy that he goes I'll show you how to do it you know the new owners there'll be happy to carry a you just got to come up with a down payment so Dennis ... was a great mentor great help to us when we got here\nSo what did you learn from guys like Sloan and be hand in your own experience of ... adding radio stations you sold for radio stations over the left or some of the big lessons that you learn from those guys about radio well\nThe the big lesson to me is you know I came from the you know being a DJ in a sales guy so I didn't know business at All right and so I learned from those guys how to operate you know you it's great to have a radio station great to have the format you want\nYou can have listeners but if you don't operate it correctly you're going to be losing money right if you lose money you won't be around very long so the operation part of the thing is really really critical so guys like that were mentors I Would call Dennis often and ask them questions or gym\nAnd just get the advice that I needed to move on remember when I got the opportunity by the station 'cause grace apple told me he said look we don't want to operate the station we know that you're you're called to do this that this is something for you and I'm going well I I don't know what to do he goes well you got to go\nYou know get ... get a backer or get a bank loan or whatever so I go down to see valley national bank remembers international Louis so I got an appointment down there and I walk in and I've dressed up in my time my suit and I'm a\nYou know young guy in a vigorous and all that and I walk in and he goes let me see your balance sheet I go what's the ballot [laughter]\nGets up he shakes my hand he goes I never do business with people that don't know a balance sheet\nAnd that freaked me out so I got out of there and I started thinking I Need to I Need to learn stuff threats I learned it from business people also Tom Regina Sherman came my partner and George meal they were great business people and so they taught me but I also went to school I ended up getting my master's degree at University of Phoenix\nIn organizational management so\nThat was helpful to but the organizational part the operational part of a of a station is critical yeah you know there's a lot of people that have great ideas it's just like in other businesses you may have a great idea for a restaurant or you know for a retail store you can operate can't make money you won't be in business\nYou've got to balance the south side of the job but then there's the hard side of the job what's the number is half the tumbled correctly they do All right let's get a call in before we go to break let's go to bill number one on line three billion with Doug Martin\nDuring this meeting were at this we're at the table um ah the president of manage with Robert ... yeah Roberts there right he's ... he's ... he's on the laptop right you All right Tom and govern from selling us was there he was the past chair\nAnd then Barney and then Mettler was there but no one cared and then what happened is and it's the three of us and Mike Varney is yelling at us for most of the meeting\nAnd all I can tell you is Doug Martin stood up for us so beautifully I was very called on me\nYou were here till the up and all I could tell you I ... I won't reveal what Doug said that my car okay and then after he does this job and I are like pastor Doug right and so we're we're we're in the parking lot having a little deeper fright and the first thing Doug says\nSorry you had to see that guy that was great I live for those [laughter]\nWell you know the question is you know we we did our thing on the air and we're educators and young Turks as a ... a and you played a different role in the community you were on the boards and you're trying to pay\nPastor Doug what\nDid you learn over our seven year term or by stepping your turn would wake up to something that was the lightning to\nWell I think the big thing is is you know our our background was Christian radio and and so I really was not involved or didn't care about politics you know I mean I Would vote\nYou know but I didn't know really you know like you just we're talking with police should choose on the school board you know I didn't it was a school board I mean you just see names and you vote for the name that you think sounds good or whatever you seen it you know I sign or whatever\nBut knowing what I Know now it's really it's it's scary you know realizing the the issues are our city is facing and in our county and it's also it motivates you so I think that's the thing that you guys do on your show a lot of people may not like it because they don't like having the rock scored\nAnd in our city is running away over the years that has been very much a city of corruption collusion cronyism you know nepotism\nYou know and and it's not good you know there's been a lot of waste of funds and you guys have gone through all that and everyone you recover unreal Nuevo afraid that was an amazing deal most people didn't know what was going on right we we thought it was all okay\nNow I remember we gave the mayor I a wiki award at our annual meeting because we said thanks for having ... because there was that the right time of our show where\nIt helped to bring a lot of attention 'cause we're the only ones call in and out\nYeah and that to me is the big thing Joe as you guys have brought out those issues that most people aren't aware of and and I think it's helped you know even though you may look you know and I I Know we've talked privately about all this and seen have we made progress here in Tucson I mean yeah good question that right\nWell we'd be a lot worse off if there hadn't been a wake up to sign\nA spare candidate and adopt you know we'd hit it on a top down there about border walls or guns or anything that was on Fox News and immediately people with no one identify but what we're trying to do is tell this deep\nNews and immediately people with known identify but what we're trying to do is tell this deep in an interesting story about how the local thing works ... to get folks aware and up into the action unable to vote and they can tell just decisions future so\nWell and that's one of the big part of that thank you\nWell and that's one of the scary things really about to send it because the average person out there is so ignorant in an uninformed you know people are going in and just voting for if they're a Democrat that just vote for Democrats and they don't even look at the character of the person they don't look at what if what if they'd done all these years you know and I'm thinking you know particularly I look at\nSomeone like a ... you know it's been in office wet Eighteen years or Twenty years or something like that\nI mean his brightest moment was when he was protesting back in the seventies you know for the you know when they were Mexican American people were being discriminated against for those protests over there at a\nAt a real right and it was a it was a big moment in the right thing but since then you look at it his his tenure on on the supervisor board lettuce to having a baseball stadium that no longer operates right right I mean we lost major league baseball because we put the stadium over where he wanted it\nRight you know and then you look at what he's done as as a congressman has he really help the people in his district and that's what really counts ... you know you've got working class people in that district that could be helped by say a rose my mind he opposes it\nRight you know he's never visited racy\nWell most people don't even know that rate dance in his district right right and so it has a lot of people in his district work at Raytheon or work for companies that support break the I mean this is what you want for congressman you want them to be supporting the things that create jobs and opportunity for people that are disenfranchised\nAnd under privileged right and that's his district instead of keeping them dependent on the government correct so well\nJody land brother failed or if you had that if you had to pick one of the two of us to really have a close friend or ever who would you pick between Christian myself\nWell for me you guys are like\nYour your your in your\nIn separate or two headed monster yeah I I look at I look at you ... they had and I could not make that distinction ... faster dog for maybe like Solomon and you know having the baby the baby that's why I just can't do it you'd lose like Forrest Gump Joe peas in Apollo\n... thanks guys appreciating Joe ... thanks for their students I think he just\nThinks they have to buy a let's sneak empire John and before we got to break up fire John you're on Doug Martin what's up buddy\nDoug I appreciate what you've done all we're all the years you're not met at your place

go to break if I had to choose between a a Christian Joe I Choose at\nAd appreciate a man's man I oh\nI only fly jets I've watched him do his board ... more balls in the year that I Know how to juggle
