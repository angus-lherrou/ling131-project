I know we talked a little a couple of years ago the issue was education\nYou have gotten worse over the last the last four years and with a teacher walkout at the end of last session and if he number one issue that when I talked to Arizona and want to see some of that and then he wants to ... public school\nSo he's talking about that David Garcia plan because that's something that's been a little question if you have some gray area there on the plan to improve education what is what is that what what what what does that mean what does the David if you don't think what Doug did in may and everything is enough or even prop one two three and these other things what do you want to do\nWell look first and foremost it comes down to two things are are may first we do need to fund public school\nIf you think about it are still eight hundred million dollars short of two thousand level that's a decade ago when we were living in short ... other states and are moving faster they are investing in education all the way up to the university by the way\nAnd we continue to lag behind and so for me it prioritizing new revenue to go into education and stop cutting tax credits in Arizona that are still taking money out of public education and sending it to to private school\nWe got an exemption in state law that we've got to look at and make sure that they still continue to serve Arizona going forward and then last Arizona's two hundred and Seventy thousand of them put a and a fish have on the ballot the Supreme Court took it off\nBut I Believe his own ends in teachers in particular want a dedicated revenue source for education so that we don't go down this treadmill over and over and over again\nI and our teachers can rest assured that there is dedicated funding go into public education and so that is on the second we got to get back to teaching again and my plan includes getting away from such a heavy emphasis on standardized testing and back to some real world outcome that\nMake a difference in students' lives and that you know ... allowed to get in the classroom\nAll right so ... as you were talking I was writing down some notes so when you talk about some of the tax breaks out one on one of the big tax breaks I see is what we called G plots\nRight you know what a G put his right yeah All right and how they use that by cities for economic development and that's something that takes money out of the uh the the local district 'cause that's something that you would revisit impossibly getting rid of those\nIf you um you know and yeah and I and it's actually a really good article explaining to taxpayers how they ultimately ended up not only paying for those but how those ... are taking money out of public education you know it is it\nUm we're seeing those in cities and towns but we're also sitting in a number of the things that go back\nTo individual lobbyist legislator relationships that we got to ask ourselves\nOr go to instill in the best interest of Arizona and to look at them well you got to go into this um without being beholden to any body is the reason why our campaigned is not a lobbyist dollar corporate tax dollars\nFor that as we look at what isn't the best interest at Arizona if we can look squarely at what's in the best interest of the people of Arizona rather than special interests\nSo but then the ... but in the end do they get to the funding that you want your you're going to have to convince a legislature to project taxes correct\nWell in this case a week ... they're not necessarily know hum you know first and foremost\nBecause even with all the stuff that's going on I feel like I always like to say like what's that number right 'cause there's lots of states that fund education the higher levels would even worst\nResults than we do look at you know the ... you know the D.C school district or New York city area so so tell me what's the magic number what does it need to be and how would you actually get there without raising taxes again\nUm our magic number is to get back to ... thousand a level where it's still a hundred million dollar short\nAnd we get there by closing tax credits that those are credits that right now take money out of public education go to private schools\nAnd this is about ... in prioritizing existing revenue looking at those exemptions and then a reader going through the legislature or through a citizen initiative and here's the key to put a dedicated revenue source in place for education and the key word is dedicated because\nYou know what we if that is not in place\nThen the legislature in legislatures and continue to hack away of public education funding it's what teachers are worth fighting for with respect to the rent for that movement so that that dedicated revenue sources available they can go back to the classroom and not have to worry about feature legislature it's going in hacking away\nSo let's talk about teachers' salaries who is responsible for teachers' salaries\nWell so if you look at it if you just outraged come from two major places I first and foremost is the state level\nSettled for those school districts that are fortunate enough local ponds and override partly override help out but at the state mascot at this at the um as the state has cut the the general fund budget school districts have had to make\nThey just cut the for general fund budget gold district had had to make up until that that boy\nOr a limb David David David you're going up again ... who's responsible for what teachers get paid who who again who's responsible for what a teacher gets paid number one\nThe the the primary responsibility is at the state level but if you're cutting at this\nHow can you avoid how we how what kills me is that you're totally ignoring school boards okay is that that's the part I Know that's not part of your rhetoric that you want to get out as part of your campaign\nBut school boards are number one they're the ones who determine what teachers get paid now yes part of their revenue it has to come primarily from what they're getting from the state\nBut we have school districts that got money from the red for red twenty four twenty that did not pay their teachers even all of that\nSo how do you let ... and that's the worst part of the teach education for a living you're considered an expert on it so are you not going to say there are some responsibility for the school because we're we're we've got to you as the it's one of the worst school districts\nDown here it's a total anchor on this community getting going again so please please tell me school districts are not responsible for a teacher sellers\nI specifically said that it come from two places first and foremost is the state and read back in local overrides\nWhich are at the district level it is both that are that are that are determined teacher's salary\nIn addition a you've got to keep in mind that the the idea here it's not just teachers' salaries but making sure that everybody who contributes to the classroom included\nThere was a number of the court professionals particularly by the way in low income areas where those professional that support to get students ready for the classroom\nThat should be included teachers have come forward and said not just about teachers' salaries it is about improving education in general and goes everybody who contribute to getting students ready for not ready to radio learned in the classroom\nSo since a governor do see a took office the economy in Arizona especially in Maricopa and some other years has been rocking pretty hard uh what what's something that you think you would do better if you were governor in relation to keeping the economy going and moving in this state\nYeah well everybody is growing by the way nearly every state is growing most of the fastest growing state in the country are in the west by the way a and among those still lag our little group Washington Oregon Colorado\nI'm consistently ahead of us and I think we need to do a a couple of things one got to focus on a high quality a highly trained workforce here in Arizona this is not a ... more of a high ranch conversation and making sure we got that workforce\nBut the shift we can make here is switching to focusing on businesses starting building and staying in Arizona\nWe continue our focus on attracting businesses outside of Arizona\nBut a can and should do more about businesses that started here grow roots you get back\nIs our number is ... built across the or across the western United States and I think that would be a specific focused we can we can shift to here in Arizona it's also going to allow our young people a entrepreneur for example who have an idea to stay in Arizona and grants those ideas\nWhat strategy would you uh are going to be one strategy you think the help of homegrown businesses in Arizona\nYes so you know it's a other states have had for example a incubator opportunities for them whether they are state and local um in addition you got the opportunity to take advantage of technology is really important so cool Arizona or you can train or stay in the Dallas\nUsing for example a you know watching technology for folks to you can work anywhere in the world and stay in their local town just grow your own programs that can be done through community colleges that can build local economies\nYou can I I'm the one that comes up often ... cotton wood and emerging wine industry then started programming apple pie college for example I'm a rural Arizona can move wanted a solar in in as we get a raise new novel generating station a that is\nA possibility and died in a college up there is interested in getting a soldier program\nAnd then of course even the Arizona Republic wants the only thing they could pick on you on to something about how you didn't you know you didn't say I believe in climate change and that kind of thing\nAnd that's what your answer was correct your chamber of commerce president yeah\nRight so yeah everyone around that after ... right now that I certainly\nUnderstand climate change is happening right um and but in in this\nCommunity where we have debated environmental issues and concerns minds has been around the mining industry and you know the the fact that Rosemont Copper mine isn't very controversial I have been a big proponent of the mining industry\nBut in a thoughtful way as a chamber of commerce Hispanic Chamber we brought in resident copper mine early the pro and con this was gosh what six eight years ago or something I think that sounds right yeah I'm\nA carpetbagger the shade after ... years and I I was younger\nThan I mean we thought\nWe went through this and decided that the restaurant copper mine is one of the most environmentally\nFriendly mindsets in built in and I I think the nation much less Arizona in decades cell or something that we probably stand behind so that's where my head went around environmental impact and climate change and so on and so that's how I reacted that we certainly need that delicate balance between a corporate America I think you\nAre and businesses and small business investment um and environmental impact um\nYou know they took it however direction they want to\nGo with that answer All right so I'm pretty proud of the

while we ourselves are not perfect we have set in motion a system that can get us closer to that her fetch\nWell I Would agree with that bill I mean bottom line is even now after many many years later decades later I'm if nothing else a lot of us could still remember an and had a history book sexual World War two correct\nAnd would you disarm a population somebody like Hitler comes in and takes

right\nYup that's exactly what we're saying and I I'm I'm\nThe more time I spent overseas okay the more time I spend oversees the more the more adamant I and I I think that's the right word maybe

Devin Chris what's up\nWith a history of Columbia and in the late ... early ... so\nWhere does it go and cut up\nThe other way around twenty four I think that was one election last Thursday and then one of the liberal heavy oil in\nThat\nCase thanks for that perspective and sharing that have a good day seven nine zero twenty forty\nSomething like living there right she lived in Colombia and not just for a week for for years and not pretty and there was violence a man I mean if if I don't know when we became so intolerant\nThat God Forbid we have a Republican president\nWell I think all you guys who want to talk about how much you know Boris or out of control Trump is right all he's doing is mastering what politicians have been doing for the last Twenty years\nWell he's the best he's really the best at it and the but the part is is that he's driving liberal nuts because he follows he's keeping campaign promises that drives me crazy and having and having results\nYou hear me in an eight years of Obama when you were doing shows together was throwing myself on the floor screaming and kicking and being violent because we had Obama for eight years\nSo there's some I think there's some revisionist history going on on how people are trying to ban like favorite phrase I Know that in PC All right uh there was a revisionist history going on where there are some people trying to talk about um the Tea Party\nRight in the beginning of the Obama years right is acted the same as these left wing crazy or not even close not\nWell have you ever been to a Tea Party actually\nI have spoken to to Tea Party event okay and I saw a grandma and grandpa sitting on their lawn chair with their sign that said taxed enough already sitting there with their American flag\nThat is what I saw okay now there was one jackass in Phoenix I guess who brought a gun to a thing in the in the press one crazy but that's about as much as I could see 'cause everyone else was acting just fine yeah\nAll right so the idea to compare one of the other oh the other thing is we just had some guy\nOr some reporter I'll find the story\nWho said that the Gabby Giffords shooting was because of the Tea Party really okay and I'll listen for he didn't even do any research that the guy who perpetrated it we don't say their names on the show yeah I Am I get it was a Democrat who loved Gabby Giffords who have severe mental problem yeah\nI mean All right do you have nothing to do\nThis what happened had nothing to do with ... tea partiers yeah so you know the last person I knew that was fit screaming the day it happened\nBut it was you know those right wing radio a holes and all that other stuff but I'm just telling you said what are we going\nTo be able to rise yeah that's true I remember back when we first started with with you Chris and Joe uh and we did to Tea Party or a ... one was down at 'em\nBy the court house whatever that port city Oklahoma City oh plaza it look like Tucson meat yourself it was booze all around and then somebody speaking in the middle and people were going from Butte to boost getting their Tea Party information in their ... bumper stickers and and their handouts his that was a Tea Party\nNobody ... you know streets not at all oh walking around saying I'm so then\nThe other one was it at that you're talking about is hike orbit seal writer was it the piano you know it was on a key you know and there was a thousands of people there you know we set up a a booth and there's people everywhere and they're all walking around they're all talking these speeches are being made and everybody went home\nIt's like nobody was burning anything nobody was was you know raising Williams\nEverything you're talking about now as you can appreciate why people in Ireland people in Iceland people and very honestly many of the countries in Europe a New Zealand I was at Australia sat on they always do should they ever get if America are what they see the delivery heart's doing riots on TV yeah you're that's all they see\nBut again you have people in high positions of power right right who are also this is just not the frustrated out of work\nYou know liberal
