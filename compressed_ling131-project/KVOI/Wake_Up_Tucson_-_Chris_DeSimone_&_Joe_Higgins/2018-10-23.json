overwhelming are about ... set up a collection there and you personally think that you you um [noise] um\nHave a way of welcoming people that leaves people feeling like they need to come back more often says thank you\nLaura you're so generous and thoughtful thanks for bringing your friends out and um we hope other people will hear your words and and joining us when I wake up every morning because I Lived there ...\nA facility along with a bunch of people to manage at the border between Guatemala and Mexico the purpose of which is to take each of the families are individuals that are trying to cross into Mexico and to vet them determine whether they have a right to seek asylum\nAnd if so there'll be a they'll go through that process if not then they're sent back to Guatemala a it's a good process at least in theory I Hope it's working\nBecause it had to follow those international law that if an asylum seeker or wants to a state of claim for that he\nFirst country that you go to this where you do it that's Mexico it's not the United states and apparently the Mexican government has cooperated with us on it as as the United nations so I'm not a big fan of the UN but I'll tell you if they can make this work uh I'll I'll I'll get my hands because\nThey have the people down there that are doing the vetting\nAnd then and if there are valid asylum seekers are they are then distributed to different countries it's not just all of them in Mexico and certainly not all of them to the United states\nUh and that's that's really the way that it should be done rather than having those people have come all the way up here they are being taken advantage of remember that a lot of the most of them I think the uh uh smugglers to get them up here and try to get them across the border\nAnd the problem is if they ever do get to our own border I think people realize that\nThe policy is a combination of legislation on the books that court rulings is that if you can step on foot inside the United states and simply turn yourself over to the border patrol let's say I'm here to seek asylum\nWe don't have any place to put them in especially if their\nFamilies with a ... miners are we can only hold them for three to twenty days which is not enough time to complete the processing that's required for a ... at a silent plane so they they have to be released into the\nUnited States with a court order to come back at a certain time and a lot of them simply don't do that so it's just a way to smuggle yourself into the United states to be here forever so somehow rather uh you're caught if you ever are\nSo I Know you and Jeff I'm In a kind of unofficial a plea to the department of homeland security about the amount of these folks that are just getting relief specially at in Yuma\nExplain the process of who are these people that are just getting released by da jazz and why did they decide to take on it was a two hundred and folks and just drop 'em and you might explain explained that process and what what needs to happen to make this better\nRight well it's a little hard to explain the a head of the uh the department of homeland security was before our committee I'm a I exceeded to Senator McCain's committees armed services and homeland security and uh\nFor our committee I'm a I exceeded to Senator McCain's committees armed services and homeland security and uh when we had our hearing with the director of the FBI and a director of the department of homeland security secretary or I asked her\nWhat was happening at you because the mayor had written to me and kind of a panic given the fact that they had just announced it over control of just announced it would have to be released they use people into the community and there simply aren't the facilities in the church is a community organizations others to house these people to feed them\nTo take care of them until they can\nBe United with a number of a family or somebody else to take care of them and as I said before that\nThere are simply not the facilities of the United states government to hold these people and the law requires that you have to let them go after twenty days any that if they have the miners with them\nOr at least find herself to be let go and obviously you want to release the family is old unit in that it that so he was worried that they would have the ability to take care of these people that I asked her about that\nWe've set for it in a letter asking for more details we don't have a response yet but I'm hoping that the federal government can provide some assistance to the communities like humor which are not having to take all these people\nWell that was the ... the whole idea that new social here in Tucson we were talking about the family separation issue right isn't it isn't the idea that we're still trying to vet if the child is actually the child of the person who says there are a parent I don't understand why there's such a bad you know horrible thing\nWell no the betting you have to do the vetting first right\nIf if if it is a situation of adults with a a minor are minors you first have to find out or they used the parents or family at the miners and determine if it's a family unit or if it is a then\nThey can be processed as a family unit with an asylum planes but that takes a long time and you have to come back for a court hearing and a lot of the people who are released into just simply shut out on the street um they\nSimply don't come back for their asylum claim either because they don't think they're going to prevail and would have to\nBe a transport it back to their country of origin or if they don't win their asylum playing\nOr are they just want to wait around for the time that it takes to do that and figure that they could just melted our society and become another one of those uh ten twelve million people who are here illegally 'em up the process of vetting starts with a determination of whether the children\nOf belong to the adults that are they are that are competing them and if not then they the the children have to be dealt with under a a protocol from the department of health and Human Services we do take care of the children\nSo they're not being separated from their families anymore\nI Know that you are going to be doing this veterans roundtable Italy and Marcus Peterson and I know ten ... will be there and ah Martha McSally just the idea of the VA right this has been such a horrible experience for a lot of veterans and a lot of them having good ones what is the state of the VA right now and what needs to happen to make it better for our bets\nWell unfortunately in Tucson or their score there's a way to score a well they're doing and uh they they dropped all the way to the bottom and then um they they have and what we're trying to figure out is what was the reasons for that what can we do to\nPick up the pace and get them back to where they were because uh the to San Diego was doing just fine and by the way in terms of uh the folks at my office here or they report that generally the veterans that are pretty good experience or they had to go to be a so I I'm not sure why the score a drop the way that it did\nWe're going to try to find that out and then provide whatever such as we can to uh enabled them to get back to the place where where they should be\nBecause you're right because one of the things when the the the paradise valley VA was having mirror horrible situation everyone down here is like you know I'm Sorry that's happening what we're doing great down here so it's so weird right to see where there\nIs right at exactly the opposite of Phoenix their their ratings have proved and yet\nWe still continue to get a lot of the negative a complaint so clearly there's a lot about the system that that has got to be fixed um it took a long time to get into those conditions can take a long time to dig out of it but at least some of the policies that were put in place\nFor example Senator McCain represented Sally votes were very strong advocate of um\nA a choice so that if the veterans were having a hard time getting an appointment or getting the care they needed in the VA system or they could go to a regular physician and get care or in the meantime if they wanted to do so is simply a matter of their choice\nBut um if they wanted to they at least to have that option so there were some options provided I Know that provide it's up to a lot of folks\nBut at the end of the day we still want to fix the system itself and this is one of the things I'm going to try to learn today what what's going on and why and what can we do to make it better\nAnd one last question for you to sixty wrote will rule in the Senate is this still a good idea the sixty vote rule\nWell it's been eliminated for confirmations of judicial nominations or for district court for circuit courts of appeal approach of the United States Supreme court so there's only a majority requirement now or the confirmation of the president's operations to the court right sixty vote rule still\nCan apply it doesn't automatically ... but\nIt can apply to members of the Senate or object to the regular order as it's called\nAnd and demand that process and you can't get sixty senators to agree to move on then you've got to have sixty senators to do whatever it is that you want to be the next whether it's a ticket vote on an amendment or take a vote on final passage of a bill or whatever it might be but it only for changed legislation now\nAnd uh if if you had time might explain why I think that it's still a good process uh it enables the Senate to take his time to do things right and it really requires compromise between the majority of the minority in the Senate\nAll right hold on while I can I can I get from one more second because I Know gosh are you there\nMust have only come back then I'll give you that then you can explain why you think the sixty votes for passage of amendments are passing laws\nYou think is still a good thing to hold on I appreciate that Senator Jon Kyl on the phone heading down towards Tucson doing a veteran standing round table going to go see the border patrol or he's going to tell us why he thinks the sixty votes role in the Senate it's a good thing we\nWe do we receive ten", "show_name": "Wake Up
