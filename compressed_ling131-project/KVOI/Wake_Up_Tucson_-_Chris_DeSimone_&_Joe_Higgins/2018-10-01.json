Congress and or else Charo and you know all these folks that you know this is the kinds of Hamilton distilleries with a box and recognize winery\nA dragon brewery I mean these are things that you can't get anywhere else\nRight on a listener just hit me up they want to know about tickets in relation to do I have to buy the whole thing how does that all we're\nSo the way it works is you go to the website and there's a link to tickets or individual films or ten bucks a pop a show it's even cheaper than the multiplex uh and\nBucks a pop a so it's even cheaper than the multiplex uh and then or you could buy a pass for forty five dollars gets you into everything so it's um it's very reasonable uh and you know and it it really comes down to how much time do you got you know I mean if you look at the schedule I mean we've\nGot five bucks yeah it was a that was ... it is it's a screaming deal yeah so\n... why do I see Taylor Davidson's annoying name on this what's going on so so tell me about your ... you have a lot of sponsors which is great I'm Glad all those people are but certainly there are special thanks to several people in your welcome tell me who who and why [noise]\nUh well sure I mean this is this is one of these things where uh you know it takes it takes a village honestly I'm\nThis is all volunteer there's nobody's getting paid for this except the vendors are so this is a kind of have to lean heavily on on your ah your family your friends\nAnd Taylor and re uh who actually are also one of our vendors because that's where our insurance comes from but\nThey are jumped in immediately ... actually the last year they were like we want to get involved what can we do and so this year they've helped us a lot with just kind of coordinating it like I said this is doubling the footprint doubling kind of you know almost doubling our number of films where we really of up the game here so\nIt really helps to have a great group of people um to to help and it's not just my wife and kind of my partner in crime or Jennifer a to a joyful joined burger\nOr but also you know Taylor and re and Kelly does our volunteers and actually and there's just you know this kind of thing it's hard it's like a start up you know it's a start up that you work you work eleven months to do and then it happens over one weekend\nSo tell me how patient your wife is\nSuper thank you very much\nAt seven literally until eleven\nOr twelve at night we're doing stuff I mean there's so many elements to this you know tickets in ballots in science and posters and you know tribute ... and three screen credit things and postcards and posters and programs I mean it's just it's a it's a phenomenal amount of collateral material and she makes it all looks fabulous so yeah so\nI Am fascinated on the looking and you have these great people coming Catherine Hardwick right director uh Haley little Richardson actor which you plant split was she the main girl he was the one of the girls that was also with her\nYeah so it was there was three right there were captured a and she was the second ... she was the second major one you know they they peeled the one off and right right right okay she's great because she was also in one of my favorite movies of the last two or three years uh Columbus which was just a beautiful movie with John Cho\nA and she was in that movie and then she's in support the girls that were showing she's in the chaperone which is about Louis Brooks um the famous island actors I she was in operation finale with Oscar Isaac and Ben Kingsley okay well that's right so she is she ended the cool thing about her also too is that she would ... I was born and grew up in Phoenix and so she's got this great Arizona\nConnection very variable now this is something that we play ... talked about a lot over the years\nCritic versus audience panel yeah because we you know mark and I talk about it all the time when we see the rotten tomatoes score yeah and then there's the audience score a totally different audience score the last three years has been more accurate than the ... the the critics or\nDoes that sound that oh yeah well the ... yeah I I think rotten tomatoes is broken a and I honestly and then you know I actually go to medical critic of most of the time because it seems like as an as funny met a critic is almost almost always what you know the audience so\nYeah I met a critic is another aggregating site a first for film reviews yeah this is Chris Gore's an amazing guy and Christian I've known each other because we're both members of the broadcast film critics but he also started film threat which is the magazine and the podcast and everything else and so he's a\nHe's a big film guy and he was on attack of the show for a while he's just a great guy okay oh I'm I asked him to come and do a to do something for you know at the film festival and he was like absolutely so we kind of a shooting around ideas and this uh this critic versus audience saying just came up because\nYou know it is this world of kind of polarizing things you know do you believe the reviews and then do you believe the social media buzz you know you see something before it even comes out there's ten thousand tweets about it and you know it's\nJust what I mean the critics on the trash of a film called the less Jetta on rotten tomatoes was aggregated Ninety four percent you know it's great I mean how many how many critics can be addicted the crack cocaine yeah I Am watching I don't know I don't know it it really makes you wonder now what topics are we going to tackle on critic\nVersus audience so uh it's funny we decided on a couple of things uh one of your indie film sucks because of course we've seen a lot of them are going to talk about that because everybody thinks they're film is a magazine or a new movie critics are idiots that's another topic that we're going to hit ain't\nGoing just service and then uh and then of course how to direct a nude seeing you have to throw into that has Newt in it so people will show up [laughter] so yeah I'm looking at\n... scores picture and I know exactly who is do you yeah I mean\nHe's you know he he's an icon of guys that you've seen him before on things he says to who he is a really great guy he does he does a lot of stuff that a duck he's at Comic Con every year he's a drag economies and everything so he's just a he's a hoot so yeah come come see Chris advantage\nAlong with Kathryn Bigelow I mean it's just remarkable to have somebody of that town and somebody that's worked here in southern Arizona she worked on tombstone she worked on on a on tank girl she worked on three kings so she loves the desert she loves Arizona ...\nSky yeah she was up yeah she's production designer yeah because one of the better parts of the film it really is yeah\nAnd you know we were doing her her little real her tribute real that we're doing and it's it's interesting to try and eating start polling stuff from these folks films and you're like wow you know I mean she's she's remarkable I mean she the production design on to study you look at that movie and it's\nIt's so stylish and been outside so stylish and then she directed Thirteen she directed you know all these amazing film so certainly in about ... teen is Evan Rachel what's first movie and it's Holly Hunter and and she's the wild child she's like Thirteen Years old and memories and she hangs out with Nikki read\nAnd she gets her tongue pierced and she's you know going out late at night and hanging around with the wrong people it's just that whole dynamic of mother daughter and just kind of teenage years and it's just brilliantly captured\nBut yeah so it's um it's kind of like a I almost feel like this is a little bit of a coming out party for us in a way that you know we're just this year three is just a big step up for us and and you know now I've got folks approaching us and saying hey we want to show at your festival so that's exciting\nAnd what do we want to do next year [noise]\nUh you know I I think I think it's more of the same um I think I'd like to hopefully I'll also have a little bit more budget a little more help because it's it's a lot of work it just you know puts it puts on a lot of stuff but I Will say the other thing about this is\nWe're trying to build up our offseason programming so a couple of weeks ago we did a screening by the pool at the AC Hotel we did raising Arizona out of the pool\nAt sunset I mean it's just so great you know an Arizona film a classic comedy is sitting in a pool watching a film on the roof of the hotel you know I mean that it couldn't be great or greater so we're working on line with us\nOr Arizona What was your boy weren't [laughter] I don't know is wearing ... would you go to [laughter]\nIt's just you know so year round we want to do more stuff and because we have this thirty four inflatable screen you're going to see us out a little bit more frequently but you know we're we're just continuing to serve the you know the the the audience into instant Tucson with us stories connecting stories and the audience is\nWhen you're buying your tickets okay ten bucks a ticket to go to a film mhm if you want to do the the pass which gets you to see how many films\nWell you know I mean there's there's you know it's thirty eight films and you get the more as we're now will tell you I mean yeah you know I think the thing

early and stuff like that so that's you know that's just a nice way to have a little bit higher level of experience\nThat was all good in the hood as we like to say\nIt's called film fest Tucson its
