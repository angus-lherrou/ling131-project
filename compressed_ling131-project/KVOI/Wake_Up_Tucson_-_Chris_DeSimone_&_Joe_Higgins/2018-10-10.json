I might have to yes the way it's going around here you know so so I I understand\nYeah there's a lot that you'd say that I I agree with and uh and I understand\nYou know the frustration that you might I just you know it\nIt's the most it's a very interesting issue\nIs I think both you and I and everyone else on the no you know vote no on for six three they all believe that the roads needs to be fixed there's probably no one that doesn't take that and that is correct roads needs to be fixed and uh you know the\nThe problem that we saw in our listening to work for uh the the sales tax advisory commission\nThe the you know the problem here is you know same thing that you have to all the time you know trust and it doesn't matter whether it's ... it's\nIt doesn't matter whether it's ... it's a you know\nMiss you know it it whether it's deserve mistrust there for a seat you know perception is reality if people don't believe that\nThere but the numbers don't mind okay Chicago berry's been charged with the county for almost a quarter of a century sharing Bronson has been over there for almost a quarter century Ramon in ... Richard I've been there since two thousand three two thousand four okay and the roads are now almost what we call an eight hundred and sixty million in the home or whatever the the moving numbers\nBut it's disgusting so the idea is that when you talk about trust perceived there is no perceive\nThis trust they earned it\nOK you would not if you had an employee at the hotel that you had a budget that was you know a million dollars or something like that and they didn't do what they were supposed to do with it and you say oh you know what we need to work on that and then they didn't do it again then you put them on an action plan and then you would have gotten rid of them\nYes correct correct correct but I looked at all but I Would still have to repair that deficiency I wouldn't say oh I'm not going to repair it because ah Joe was still in the job so you know I think I'm frustrated I what better roads and uh\nYou know and this will accomplish this little accomplishes this there's many\nThere's many problems and Pima County as in every county\n... the idea that you into business leadership in this community the want basically to throw another tax and not even asked Chuck and the three Democrats to prioritize any part of the budget to general budget is I think it's sad\nOkay because the idea that you're buying it hook line and sinker that he says he has no money\nRight he's going to get eighty to Ninety million dollars of her ... and ... from the state and none of you have demanded you take an extra ten million of that and put it towards fixing the dam road\nThat's the problem I have with the yes on four sixty three folks is that you're not demanding stuff out of your local government that you would demand from yourself you would demand from your businesses or the organizations that you run that's the sad is one of the saddest parts of your guys as a advocacy for us on four sixty three\nIs that either you're afraid okay or not you but other people have to do business in the county and they don't want to piss off Chuck\nRight at or they're part of what's going on over there so that's the problem with me even with the sales tax I said it ... times on this thing how 'bout instead of a half cent sales tax\nGo with a quarter percent sales tax right then what you do is you get enough money then you say Chuck we would like the county to match what's raised by the quarter cent sales tax write you could have got an alley to vote for that you know why 'cause she would have a little bit of a wind saying hey Chuck finally took the money out of a ... billion dollar budget and fix the freaking wrote\nBut no one wanted to hear that we went straight the tax\nAnd so what happens though is that you guys say I heard I've heard from amber at the chamber I've heard it from all your folks there's no other way to get the roads fixed we've got to do it now they're falling apart and I got an idea\nShocking let us suffer for Twenty years with crappy roads\nAll of the leaders need to you guys know the problem is that the majority on the board of soups and Chuck don't prioritize roads Gary Davidson has read from Chuck memo that he doesn't believe roads is a priority\nHe says oh we get ... get banged on because I don't make roads a priority I think the voters want other things is what he said in his own memo okay so when you guys I don't know if you guys are just you know blissfully ignorant of this stuff\nOkay but you're going to come here and say hey Pima County we need an extra half a billion out of you right where somewhere between thirty and fifty billion is going to go to issue an interest costs\nOkay we're going to do a ... the the way we're going to pick roads are we have Seventy percent of the roads and Pima County or poor failed right now right so the way it says in the in the bond is that oh we're going to pick the ones that need Millan Phil ... rebuilds okay that's part of the bond language\nSo what happens is it's going to go to the transportation advisory committee\nWhich I'm On and I know how that works and you didn't happen to you at the sales tax advisory committee you guys through a thing out they perverted that no one voted for it\nOkay so what will happen again will go to the transportation advisory committee alright district one and for what you live in one of them okay right now okay we're the ones that always gets screwed by the other three okay so right now we're already you have just on the pure numbers 'cause truck gets three appointees\nHe takes our money does whatever the hell he wants with it and you know it and so does the rest of the people on in the county you know it's going to go into more diamond roads and more of this and that\nAnd it's you know we've seen it and they keep promising and they never do it they get the money they get the money from the regular straight your\nYour point three percent sweat okay point three percent okay they get a million dollars a year for Thirty years that I've just been in there and nothing that we have a correction how black because they put more Taryn ...\nSix points three percent is that Gary has taken shucks I'm\nA member of everybody and he said he got the money from the earth\nDiversion was sweet sweet such ally that word I okay the hurt but doesn't version\nReally comes out to he said it was I don't know three million dollars a year okay was the diversion total each year for unincorporated accounting of eating so he would have to find point over three percent a third of one percent of the budget to fill in the ... version for unincorporated county so that\nThere is a ... year yeah every everybody's sick of the roads we we can't stand that we haven't standard for years I've been here since the sixties man\nPeople have been people have been building houses on the outskirts of town for fifty years and he never built a road to him now he's finally getting at the end of Broadway we're finally got you know or go wrote in and those people up in ... for years I mean\nHe whatever the hell he wants to hell with the rest of us and that's where we're at against for sixty three because we don't believe it why would we believe it now it's never happened in the last thirty forty years it ain't gonna hang out all their\nLast word and then I got to go you got to get well I got I think it brought 'em out of seven thirty break that's at seven forty so\nI think that brought up something or you know very important it is a matter it is a matter of trust\nA I think everyone believes that the roads needs to be ... I Believe that this will get them done people are going to vote based on whether they there's trust and the the all the other problem with that that I have a concern we probably have that concern thank you very much for this\nChristmas bringing attention to we're so far down on the ballot prop for sixty three in the state has so many props sure\nI Want to know what the voters I Want to know what the voters thing and so I I thank you for bringing attention to it so that people will make an intelligent vote\nOn Fort I'm Glad you here I got one last question I'm going to get the last word but did you get the less whereby answering this question what is your uh confidence level and Chuck Huckleberry and the three days to actually prioritize and fix roads and an ethical manner over all three all five districts\nI'm not I'm not sure I have the the breath of knowledge\nOf this that that you played young man in ... in order to to make a judgment on that\nWhy are we running for office that are about Wendell thanks for being here buddy hey thank you Chris always fun thanks for being a Christian and ... remember vote yes on four sixty three I got a ... going to listen to\nThe song and you know maybe if I listen to it forty eight times today maybe I'll I've got a rage that could be it's going to be sent right into your ...

Dr Christine Blasey Ford on the Democrats' side also but\nIt is all um has been choreographed for almost two years now so I started out the peace\nOn the blue wave was pointing out that it's been simply a construct ... time it's a term that was thrown out there with the intention of creating momentum\nAnd you can actually I put a Lincoln the in the article\nYou can actually monitor the use of phrases on line over a period of time ... and we see it's spiking blue wave starts to gain prominence around the first in March of this year and in political a in a political reality\nThat eight months ahead of an election is virtually impossible to make any valid production because two weeks in politics is an eternity so\nUh what what often happens is\nWell let me preface this with anything in the way of polling or anything that you see on a major media absolutely cannot be trust\nI fell off of my exercise bicycle two days ago [laughter] um the most I ever watch of network television is somehow among the exercise bike at the gym\nAnd it's up in front of me right so sometimes you can't help but it's like clockwork orange you know I just you know they they watch them and stuff right\nAnd I saw a commercial about\nAll the good things Republicans have done in the state of Arizona wow economics funding education teachers all this stuff right and making it a better business environment and I'm looking at a going what the hell is this right and it was by it was the the money came from the Arizona Republican Party it looked like but\nI was 'cause I've been saying are the Republicans finally going to to their own horn on why voting Republican is better for your employment your discretionary income within women created businesses all these different things right and I finally saw one I was like oh my God\nMaybe it's happening and that's I mean that that's I ... I keep talking about it is that a valid fear that Republicans aren't that that's I ... I keep talking about it is that a valid fear that Republicans aren't doing good enough job\nSaying you know ever since we kinda took things over including the president said two years ago this has happened this has happened and then go You're welcome voting for us yeah that's a do you think we're doing a good job and my ... no oh no you\nJust made a better campaign commercial thing when you're Republicans right in the months but you know what I Am convinced that this stuff\nMaybe below the radar\nBut the average American knows what the hell's going on I think it's obvious how well things are going\nI mean you look at you can try to hide the unemployment numbers but all you have to do is here at once right we have the lowest minority unemployment virtue and women unemployment virtually ever\nIt's astonishing and stacks and stacks and stacks of other things including things like whether you're on the left or the right you see a quote unquote politician that keeps us promises what a boom and not all the\nThat is another ... another amazing thing that's totally overlooked because the ... the press hates them so much is he actually does keep us promises\nAnd on one amazing thing after all the things that have gone for generations promise than on delivered things with regard to bringing\nBringing remains back from Korea we're talking about before well before you were born yeah before I was born right her during a I was born during the Korean War\nOr the every president in memory is talked about bringing\nThe uh the embassy in Israel or American embassy in Jerusalem and they said we couldn't do it we shouldn't do it at all it's gonna explode all these bad things are going to happen well you know what he promised he did it nothing exploded\nAnd ... you know what amazed me on that particular one is the speed or which he did it because they actually kept an existing structure the consulate in Jerusalem simply became the embassy so bang it was done\nYou and I love about the things they really bang on them for which is pretty funny right so we had all of this German drying over the separation of kids and their parents or possibly their parents at the border let me just finish this thought\nOkay the Jerusalem thing right uh we talked about but also the ah ... ah we talk about um\nThe Iran deal right that's another thing ah the ah he wanted the Ninety day\nFreeze on immigration from certain countries right because of terrorism which most of those countries came from the Obama State Department that's right okay and all of\nThese things that they want to go these are things that have to do with I I keep seeing stories right about these people that show up at the border and the wait time for these people just want to show up and come in without any identification or anything it's too long I see people complaining about that as sort of do you understand that these people are not American citizens\nRight and you're going nuts about things about people and things that he's dealing the heal a lot of people and their lives that rising the John F. Kennedy rising tide that raises all boats\nVoice [noise] [noise]\nYeah they Jack up more [noise] out of Asian for the rock and Roll Hall of fame [noise]\nI think one song the seals rockets which is a black cat so I got out I almost played that one yeah OK eight thirty nine in the morning Barney brand proceeds from my own uh we're going to be on the propositions discussions have you have any ones you have questions about seven nine zero twenty\nForty you're asking me how much money to kids from uh the yes on four sixty three are going to probably raise from what I saw a funny Wendell showed me his copy of the official campaign finance for a U.S on it but I didn't see it on the actual site this morning so\nUh hey ah whoever does that at the reporters office they need that up so people can see who's spending money on this summer it feels like you're dragging your feet but I'm sure you're I'm sure you'll still have all legally have a few days to go\nBefore you know before we move on let me just touch real quick on the on the so called blue waves and encourage people\nOut and this is one crucial election you need to bang on banging the drum yet friends neighbors people in other communities other states we need to turn out\nVotes or the one thing that makes an elections get lost for Republicans\nAre apathy people like you know people won't vote for le or because they're they're uh they're whining because their guy didn't win right the other thing is is balance may win balance that rock on someone's counter and don't get\nWe special what we specialize that an error southerner though let's this cycle let's keep that to a minimum folks get out there and vote get your neighbors to vote at every level let's ... so\nThe paid lobbyist for Pima County Michael Rafi was that the government Affairs Committee of the Hispanic Chamber and he wanted his um\nReasons why you should vote yes on four sixty three is that the ruling class the Pima County has raised a quarter of a million to three hundred thousand dollars okay to um to shut this down your throat and you and I were talking you said what a waste of resources\nAnd that's and it's a secondary ruling class they're trying to curry favor that's true real ruling class that's\nWell played Brenner well played so what I'm saying is we're both like you're going to give hundreds of thousands of dollars for a small chance for Chuck to drop a little bit of bone off of the dinner table but if you actually spent that trying to break up the Democrat three\nHadn't been put toward come demarco two years ago you would have a different county right now you can experience riches instead of bones you know it is astonishing what you know it's about leaders\nYou go you would have a different county right now you can experience riches instead of bones\nYou know it is astonishing what you know it's about leadership\nIt's astonishing what good leadership at a A N any government level could mean you know we've got if you look at to USD Pima County and the city of Tucson here we're talking about three billion dollars a year which I Would say a third of that\nIs wasted or counterproductive when you look at what you really need for core services roads parks Tucson is looking at ... park if you prioritize that money roads parks a public safety and forgot everything else\nYou would transform the community and one of the things the business community is trying to do with these bonds I spoke to someone who's strong you know part of the yes on four sixty three said well if we fix the roads were going to attract businesses you know you want because everything else is still not only will is not\nFix an adequate amount of road everything else is still wrong with this community where does absolutely business unfriendly\nYou know you look what happened to Cracker Barrel a couple of years back\nWhere they were hit with incredible sees for construction that kind of message goes out all over the country the Pima County city of Tucson are not good to do\nAs well and and your biggest school districts the mess and you're the city police staffing levels of eighty eight bubble staffing levels there you go let's go to the phones going to answer ... question seven nine zero twenty forty let's go to a bird on line to Roberta you're on Christmas ... good morning\nThey would you please explain real\nQuick [laughter]\nOh let's we got a couple of calls but if I remember a thrill six is clearly elections Yes sir All right it's it's minor there is some cars medic fixes in that we can go either way but they say it uh it will prevent money\nFrom being misused and you can make a case for it or a certain amount of money is being a diverge a small amount to political parties and if you want to eliminate that then you want to a vote accordingly\nSo for the the abuse of the clean election stuff that's happening supposedly now is you're having people who are running for office qualifying for clean elections which is money coming from taxpayers to pay for your campaign right\nAnd what's happening is you're not using it all and then taking whatever's leftover and dumping it to the party that's part of supposedly what this is going to question all amount\nRight not a not unlimited funds right but again it's it's not a\nA consequential when the big you know just so we don't run out of time on it uh aside from four sixty three and then you've got a city which I'm less familiar with all the time I was seven is parks again you know what I Want to mention when truckers on the line\nBut bonding is the is the government equivalent of credit card spending of course\nAnd so you get it with interest with other maybe carrying fees and other things and it is\nAbsolutely improper to uh to finance things that way when they should if they're not prioritize than the general fund budget you're doing it wrong\nBecause what happens is that especially in the city that shock and play with your\nProperty taxes tried to cut how they got a ... thing right magic formula right but the city is mostly sales taxes so they have to live and die on their own performance of whether or not business is good and people are collecting sales taxes right that's why a city bonds even more precarious\nSeven nine zero twenty four is the phone number let's go to Chris on line three pressure on with Bernie and Chris what's up\nHey Margaret how are you today okay trying to get the word out\nRight now it's interesting the way for seven discussion with older I'm at work three and he says for several not a tax increase\nBut when you look in the the publicity guy in the\nEarly ballot it says Arizona realized that you they have to notify you that it is a tax increase\nSo both the city and the county you're playing the same game\nIs the idea that because they have retiring bonds I up what's happening is that ah those bonds they disappear will be replaced with these bonds that they're going to sell All right and what's gonna happen is they don't need the coach charge you more money\nExtra than what you're paying now but that's that Bunning as\nThe other money that you're paying goes away and now the new taxes coming in so supposedly that that they're both playing that game but if they didn't if they both go down now getting this is also you know wishful thinking your taxes\nWill drop ... well most of the same area around they will drop because these are these bond payments will go away they use the disingenuous line my vote for this cause your taxes won't go walk right that is technically true it's a half truth and the whole lie\nSo like the other one on four sixty three fall or soccer is is the um discussion about they're saying we just gave you this historic tax break right what's so disingenuous as they gave you the tax bump two years ago\nLong so they didn't they didn't have it at a press release for mark Evans on the minister grew over there saying it's the highest tax bump wherever gave you but now it's because they got rid of a two years later they're giving their their back and they're ... they're magnanimous attitude they're giving you a big tax break it's it's it's bizarre\nIt's pitiful vote no yeah\nOther one\nWas the biggest thing on on bonds even bigger than for sixty three is I think it's one twenty seven the clean energy mandate that's an absolutely that's a hell no absolute insanity because what people don't realize you know it sounds cool a renewable energy it's not\nIt's not clean to get 'em to get\nThis is a again picking winners and losers okay you get a middle and lower class are going to be crushed again\nHuge amounts of a lot of money on your on your utility bill but what they don't tell you is one a solar energy is really pretty dirty because the materials they have to use to construct the panels and then the\nUh the disposal of the panels toxic stuff a wind energy dirty and murderous it's hilarious that they seem to have a truce between the the peta people and the wind energy people because the uh the wind generators\nKill birds and bats in the millions every year but here's the worst dirty secret us at all since these things are completely unreliable and solar doesn't generate unless it's bright sunny cloud blessing not at night when generates only when there's when you're young systems", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson -
