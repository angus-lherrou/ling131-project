C. C. sculpture garden\nFree kickoff event people who are thinking about I Would like to volunteer and help them get these therapy dogs into a variety of different places whether it's hospice or schools or different places where we know therapy dogs can make a difference in people's lives\nShould be attending please do not bring your dog\nAnd uh what are some of the activities that are going to go on with\nUs so we're going to talk about how the organization all came to um I'm going to introduce a lot of the therapy teams and how people interact\nWith the dogs were gonna have raffle prices to raise a little bit of money and fund raise 'em as well as just explain the different ways that people can get back and help because you don't need to have a dog to give back we actually have a mentor people that come along with the teams and and and assist them\nI'm as an extra set of hands and help out every single time we go on their visits um and so we're just going to be able to explain our program and just get as many people in the community that to help out in any way that they would like to\nGermany brown when did you first decided I'm going to grow up and be a dog trainer wondered that have what's up moment\nYou know I'm so growing up we always had dogs my whole life and so and my parents actually worked for the police department here in Tucson and worked a little bit with the er we were around the canine unit and stuff like that and so I've always been around dogs my whole life and when I graduated college I was actually really really lucky in that position actually at pets Mart that ah\nThat train all of the trainers and so I applied for this position and I surprisingly got it and so for quite a ... a long time I trained all the trainers that worked for a pet smart and I open my own business about four years ago\nSo so ah there's a lot of dog people out there on television and things like that who's a dog person out there that you like that people would know of\nIn Dunbar is probably my favorite person he's really big on positive reinforcement time\nYou know what we see on TV is good for TV and not necessarily the best way to train the masses and so um I ... I Love being done by Victoria still well some of another one that a lot of people know about and she's pretty great Amish blood and the person's in those all those guys are great ...\nYou see on TV is good for TV and not necessarily the best way to train the masses and so um I ... I Love being done by Victoria still well some of another one that a lot of people know that and she's pretty great on his wallet and the person and those are those guys are great authors are trainers and amazing people\n[noise] so for you what was your what was your first dog as a professional [noise] that you were training\nAnd but what kind of dog was it and how did that go for your\nFirst one you know there was that was a different what's your own business rather than someone says hey I got this ya ya there's been so many\nBut the one that that really stands out to me this dog named Google\nAnd um I Know it sounds funny for his name to be Google ... Sherman is her name and she's an amazing handler in human being um she I came to me a long ago and she had this little puppy named Google has a golden doodle and she found this dog I'm looking on Google to find a dog that was like the breeds that she had in the past and\nMr Google is the best therapy dog I've ever trained in my life he is so perfect he\nJust gives love and you know just every moment you're around and he said just the best dog ever so that's the one that kind of stands out in my mind\nWhat or a basic things that people should be doing when dealing with their dogs that you see them violating on a daily basis when you're just walking around the planet earth\nYou know I I think ... direction is something that most people need to learn you know dogs don't speak our language and sell yelling at him smacking I'm doing the things that a lot of people were taught by our parents it's just not the way that you do it redirecting I'm just like you would with a two year old I have one of those at home and I really learned when he came into this world how uh\nHow you need to work with a an an animal or even a human that's that's at that stage so really understanding where the dog is at in their life and not having sex at expectations beyond that which most of us do\nAnd the energy thing is so important because it's true whether you're ... or a kid or not we got to give them credit that he went out there and really try to make bail aware that your energy is they're sensing it in a hyper away mhm and if you're going to yell and way up and things like that this was not doing anything for anybody\nAbsolutely making everybody mad and confused [laughter]\nAnd what's the number one thing you've learned about training a dog\n[noise] you know that's a that's a really good question I think from all of this especially with therapy dogs is just how much\nLove they have and they could have had the worst start like Archie was it was a rescue than I have a three legged dog get home that was had a pretty bad start and they're the best therapy dogs on the planet and the kids so much and\nYou know check the able to set that aside and and just be able to give as much as they do every single day is just such a beautiful thing\nSo what I've learned about training my dogs is that it's helped me train myself to deal with humans\n[laughter] have you guys learned that I haven't gotten isn't it's\nI hear you say oh yeah oh yeah [laughter] I Know that sounds\nWeird right for a lot of people going well how you deal with the dog is I ... you know yeah it ... the whole energy thing when you hit someone back with negative energy what do you think they're going to hit you back with correct you know I mean I I I see it all the time yeah\nAnd it's funny because dogs can sense the energy even before you you present it you know so they know the chemical changes they can smell the year ... in you that you're something's wrong or that you're not feeling well and just amazing to see how they they can relate and help you in this moment\nI have a friend of mine who has a pit bull mix dog okay and he's the sweetest couch potato in the world and when he first got um eight years ago it was all aggressive on a walk kind of thing right but he has no doubt he's gotten older or whatever but what I've noticed so I was visiting him he's out of state right and with the dog and what happens is\nHe sees another dog coming this is the human\nAnd he's so worried that this dog is going to do something the dog is literally feeding off of his anxiety and then once in awhile kind of acts up and like do you know this is all you know this has nothing to do with the dog\nAnd when I say always preached because I Am actually a therapy dog evaluated for pet partners and you know that energy travels down the line we walk in that room and were nervous as can be when we take that test and\nAnd I always tell the the people that I'm a value in just calm down relax and and I'm probably the worst person on the on the planet to tell people that because I'm more nervous than that and when I Do it with them but um it's you know that energy does travel down to at least you're absolutely right\nHow do people uh before I Want to talk about the about one more time and how to people if they want to hire you have complete canine how do they get a hold of you to do
