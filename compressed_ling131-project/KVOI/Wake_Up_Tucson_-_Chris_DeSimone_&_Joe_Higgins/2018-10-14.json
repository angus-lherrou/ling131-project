freedomworks\nBrett Kavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court and his confirmation process has energized Republican voters head of the midterm elections Andy robbed of the club for growth is here with the real story\nThe United nations is out with yet another alarmist climate report Eric Bain and run Bailey of reason magazine explore possible policy responses to the report\nOn the hard fought battle over the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh marked a new low in public discourse colonel Mike Ryan us MC retired has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nI'm loving Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe economic good news continued with release of September is unemployment statistics which found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties here the story through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom freedom works\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September\nAnd once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number\nOf unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nGot to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grows they're naturally trying to better their situation the only way they can is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually at the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable Monday variety and so I think it's a fairly strong sick\nAnd unstable Monday variety and so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy in particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign and to some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read has so far indicated that this is a very deep economic rally as Senate hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earnings for the low you're hearing about a\nSmaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's as is always the case a growing economy are generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and and my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted to work this Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay\nAnd that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never worried about that skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe as not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect you'd think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty certainly the markets like pick up probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so and the fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely\nBrought back but we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars if they're going to be made and sold in North America tear free they have to have\nA certain amount of labor that constantly sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nA North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without a mentally and there is a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course of her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact it has a just very briefly but what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have in our economy and how does it tried to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed and I wrote a book about it called who needs the fed I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks they can't really do that you know solve the bank\nWould ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission of bankruptcy the fat also regulates banks but I Can't really do that very effectively\nBut I Would agree with you again\nAlways glad to have you here on of course and I should also mention that you are the author of the book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century and that is appropriate\nOr not just to just plug your book here on the show but that's appropriate because there's a lot of doom and gloom surrounding this new un report this new climate report that looks at just how quickly we are we're going to hit and surpass that supposedly crucial one point five degrees Celsius threshold so tell us a little bit about what's in this un report\nWhile the new report is called global warming of one point five degrees centigrade and it was actually part of the process from the Paris Agreement that climate drain where the ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change\nWas invited or instructed to come up with scenarios of what would it be like or what would it take the car from warming by one point five degrees centigrade above create industrial levels of temperatures\nAnd this report has just come out and basically it says that this has to be a crash program it barked upon now crossing\nAt least forty five trillion dollars between now and twenty thirty five but we basically transform the economy from using fossil fuels to almost nothing but wind and solar power with energy efficiency on top of it otherwise all kinds of dire horrible consequences will follow\nWhat should we make of this one point five degrees Celsius threshold how significant is that number is that actually\nA real tipping point where it's not something that than active it's just kind of latched onto to use as a as more of a political trigger here how seriously we take that number and and what sort of thing has to be done even just theoretically to to avoid surpassing that's rational\nWorld what's changed as the the agreement under the Paris climate accord is basically the world should try to avoid joined about research right\nThis is the right order Kearney and ... as much power I guess a little bit of background the planet has warmed by about quite nine degrees Celsius but then the report since the late Nineteen centuries\nAnd so they basically are trying to say we only have one six degrees Celsius on average temperatures for global average temperatures to grow up before we reach this threshold at one point five degrees Celsius\nWhat they need in order to do that but they calculate is is that we have to cut off your used by forty thirty twenty thirty forty five percent\nAnd be completely weaned off of off I Hope you'll oil coal and natural gas by twenty fifty that is a huge transformation and those are the parents has rations every second place in the entire history of the world\nThey didn't ... pathways as they call us and how you might achieve that and their their takeaway message is is that they're so you'd have to start spending two point four million dollars per year\nOr two twenty thirty five in order to even get close to doing this that to your background last year the international Energy Agency\nRecorded that for all energy investment for for a year twenty sixteen I'm not into one point seven trillion and have that was just barely three ... three hundred billion in renewable so what they're calling for is essentially scaly have expenditures or knew it was like ten times what we've been better\nAnd and look if if we could stop using dirty fossil fuels tomorrow with with no negative consequences it All right if we can just shut them off and replace them all with green energy tomorrow I think everybody would be fine with that I don't think anybody is really committed to fossil fuels as I as a concept right\nBut the reality is that there are serious economic consequences to making this transition because\nFossil fuels are are cheaper and more plentiful than most of the alternatives that we have we're talking with Ron Bailey he's the science correspondent for reason magazine and the author of the book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century about just about a minute or so left here but let's I I'm just curious for your thoughts on let's assume that\nThat manmade global warming is actually a real thing what is the proper way to combat it in your mind\nA slow gradual weaning away from fossil fuels over time there are ways of doing it in their losses pathways and but the basic things or do you figure out how to invest\nIn research and development would come up with a girl and resources that are in fact cheaper but one of the interesting things I've found is that there is a terrible thing and it's just something else that could hurt and what their goals are and that is nuclear power and they basically dismiss it\nAnd I find that very puzzling because we know that we are the technically feasible and yet they just go rally sister complicated perfectly when I got to think about that because there was that we wanted to do is dot or last year or so for McConnell and and wind generation\nWhen mills what you wanted there it was the ... corps or that kind of outcome you know if you do that the problem though so\nYeah and of course now can beat them without having to spend lots of subsidies and tax credits and all of that on those uh those other ones we are unfortunately were not there yet Ron Bailey from read the magazine thanks so much for taking some time to be here tonight the rise again\nAnd again that is Ron Bailey he's a science correspondent for reason magazine you can check out his latest piece for us at ... dot com how big of a deal is an extra half a degree of global warming find that again it reason dot com check out his book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty

back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nCivility was the biggest casualty of the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings on this American radio journal commentary colonel prank Ryan us embassy retired says it's time for elected officials to begin acting more like a statesman\nIn the past month to extraordinarily different yet related events played out in the American landscape one was a headline where's the other was just a footnote\nTo first event the confirmation process for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh exploded and fury in the American media and in public discourse the second event was the announcement of the ... the medal of honor\nTo sergeant major John Kennedy for his heroism in Vietnam decades earlier I was honored to receive an invitation to the sergeant majors award ceremony\nFor my sergeant major Eddie nice the medal of honor is bestowed on those individuals who I quote conspicuously by downed tree and interpreted the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty unquote surf was self sacrifice and without regard to their own life\nVirtually every American respects the medal of honor and a significant self sacrifice\nThat the award conveys is this concept of self sacrifice while revered\nIs missing some noticeably from our society today I'm certain that are selfish preoccupation was instantaneous gratification have caused many of the problems we as a society face such a major can we fought valiantly and the battlefield to Vietnam\nAnd it's finally being recognized for self sacrifice and devotion to duty his personal bravery serves as an example ... leadership is all about and reflects great credit upon himself\nHis unit the United States Marine corps and the naval services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEver exhibited by the United states senators in the history of our nation why we're so skewed justice\nKevin ... did not faced bullets are emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in the most offensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America\nDoes very senators knew all too well that the judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians in public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conducted less actual ... says proven isn't almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court\nHad to be willing to subject himself and his family to horrific conduct by those opposed to his views\nIf a nation is ever going to attempt to rebuild itself the very character of the nation must emphasize selflessness a moral code of decency and personal responsibility our national character as represented by great she was like such a major camera\nIs under assault this battle was more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival of the freedoms that we use cells\nIn the bill of rights and for which sergeant major Kennedy and millions of others fought all of us in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here said in your window\nFor political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin okay Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nThe different type of pattern equally as important to when justice Kavanaugh fought to protect the very fabric of the constitution he has sworn to defend by not backing down he convinced me of his moral courage in the face of unwavering criticism or the primary underpinnings in any civilized societies the presumption of innocence\nThis nonsense that presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side a part of the very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution your bill of rights and common law to shoot the publicity of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politician second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stood firm\nAnd upheld the societal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators was tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when a nation centered citizens into combat and into the military\nLost in the world of cyberspace they have personalized objects and totally subject devised reality they have personalized objects and totally subject devised reality it is not at all uncommon on a given night\nFor a young man or a young woman to being transferred before\nA machine B a computer or a television set where we can get idiot dies night after night\nAnd ceased to think clearly anymore but the young person is more engaged with reality\nThrough all books than with people and ideas and relationships it's a fearsome thing right there so my son is a techie he's always pressing buttons and even when\nWe're having lunch or slow this you know and I'm trying to talk to him and I say who are you talking to I Hope you're not in the audience because I Want to talk to you and tells you stop talking to my son while I'm having\nLunch with him [noise]\nBut just Scott necessarily bad sorry dad but it's always something very\nInnocuous or just checking the scores checking whether the Braves won or not I could have told him that before he checked it\n[noise] this kind of stuff that goes on again and again and again but it takes one race over to them is very serious it is not uncommon to adopt a father a mother who says\nOur kids have cut us off from their lives we don't hear from them anymore where passe but does and I had somebody recently said to me I don't know when this all happened so\nI don't know when this happened to my son and the whole reality then is in turn allies subject devised\nHe does what is called philosophically a solid says the universe where you are the only ultimate reality that matters and you're feeding off the inside there's no objective personal reality out there\nThis is the kind of world in which we live now how did all of this come about I have traced it into the following sequence but I Want to put it side by side with the biblical narrative okay so let me give you six initial ideas that represented in the scriptures\nAnd see when you look at this holy scriptures there are three words that begins the story but I have\nBought a ... game but she's a little came in the beginning God created\nIn the English language we have five words in the Hebrew language we have three words but I have but I ... everything from the hangs on those three words in the beginning God created he does not\nAccidental that the naturalists one could kill all of the narrative\nOpted that by taking on the first three words because they knew the importance of the bag you can somehow explain humanity\nAway as a random call location of atoms from primordial slime here we are as thinking atoms\nAnd somehow talking morality and metaphysics and all of that that we are here with no pre vision no ... no ultimate\nPurpose that we just happen to be on the scene imagined that thing called the implications of that if it is true\nIf it were actually true\nThat no person no moral framework governed your existence\nNot at all surprising that or to become a very lonely planet\nI remember talking to a journalist the New York times the weeks ago when he wanted to do an interview with me on what's happening in our church is on the heels of this economic crisis\nAnd I said to him do mind serve before you ask me questions I asked for just one he was kind of humor to buy it I said really I'd like to ask you one because you're a journalist from the New York times\nI said all these decades and our Ivy League schools we trained our NBA graduates on our philosophy for us to believe\nMorality was relative that there are new episodes that\nNo outcome at right and wrong you have to determine what is right and wrong now when they become the head of Enron and banks and insurance companies and believed what they were taught and breakfast or relativistic ethic we put them behind bars why are we imprisoning them for believing that protests\nWhy are we imprisoning them for believing that professors don't you think we ought to be trying that professors as well silence [noise]\n\nSilence this distant junction between assumption and practice is this is\nThat make breaking point of our culture today you know what happened in our culture today I was showing this to friends last night a dinner I'm a very wealthy man actually you may not know this but I have in my wallet an authentic one hundred million dollar bill\nAnd I carry it fell asleep you know why it comes from Zimbabwe [noise]\nAnd it's expired [noise]\nThey're printing money there every three months one hundred million dollars probably at about me a loaf of bread because the inflation rate is five hundred when ... percent per year I don't know what that means I just started on the news\n[noise]\nFive hundred couldn't tell in person for a year where prices are doubling every thirty one hours I Know what's happened in the economy we're spending money we never had real boring money without any guarantee to ever get it back\nWe're loaning money to people who did not have the capacity to return it this will not done with one or two it was done with millionaires and it became pay day Sunday and there was nothing to be paid what happens in currency happens in morality\nYou cannot live off capital you don't have\nHe will become a spendthrift from an account that is not there and sooner or later you will to end up with moral bankruptcy\nAnd so a television executive who phones station to give up a better view of Islam than the westerners ends up splitting the proud of his wife because she was going to leave in\nWonderful solution isn't it\nYou can't spend what you don't have and what is it God intended for us to have here the six points the first thing is God made an announcement in the book of genesis and God said\nGod assumption in the narrative is that is a speaking God he's communicating God he's not a silent God he is and he is not silent\nThat is a starting point all of the book of genesis and God said\nIf you believe but I have but I have in the beginning God you also believe he's a communicating God he's a revealing God there's an announcement\nSecondly there is a monument\nLet there be let there be and God is replacing chaos and darkness with water and design have you read any of the books on spirituality we simply you talk about one confusing mess of propagate ers\nDon't waste your money and by the patrol press book on the Jesus these people actually think they've come up with some new friends simple ideas themselves most of it is utterly pathetic but stopped in New York Times best seller list\nWe bring darkness into light in the name of enlightenment\nGod brings light into darkness\nIn the name of true so he first gives you an announcement then he gives us a come on law and order and design you know I had\nBack surgery again and when you go into the surgeon's office on these shows you that spinal column and you watch the intricate networking of ... fibers and all of that and the disks and you see that with all of a central cussing\nThe human mind still cannot replicate that which has happened\nBy the designing welcome God which naturalist would like to think came from the amoeba which had no spine\n[noise]\n\nThis is so important to understand the border and design that God is giving to us right from the beginning announcement ... totally separation there is a division of night and day water and land boundaries are set\nSome guarding Institute's divisions there are demarcation there's there are lines you do not cross the boundaries you do not test there is the reality of God's setting boundaries\nIf you violate the law of gravity you don't break the law of gravity you break your self improve the law of gravity [noise] there's a reality that God has set in motion here\nAnd you want to be flooding with violating God's laws I've often said you end up breaking yourself in the process\nNumber for dessert narratives report and so God made in other words he got the revelation

America's fabric I'm your co host Charles Taylor and with me in Studio is Barney Brenner Barney is a retired entrepreneur in Tucson and he's also an occasional contributor as a columnist for town hall dot com are there any other magazines you write for\nA few years ago I had a few pieces in human events on line and that preceded my writing for town hall your\nRecent article in town hall American conservatism extremist or centrist and you start out by saying right wing extremists we hear the term incessantly from leftist media conservatives are labeled fascism haters and racist and sexist that ... on the other hand progressives are called mainstream centrist\nAnd wild vilification if conservatives abound depictions of leftist extremes are pretty rare so can you give me an example can you just opposed those to give us a working example\nWell you hear all the time that so called progressives want to help the poor and minorities and we go to extremes but\nThe conservatives are portrayed as literally wanting to kill women and starve children and clearly those portrayals are just nuts and their perpetrated by a media that absolutely cannot be trusted to tell you the truth\nGive us an example of one like say a particular story or if one comes to mind a maybe a CNN story about the or\nThe way people emphasize that I've I've heard it said that if Trump walked on water they run an article that said he can't swim\nYes and if he cured cancer they would be on the fact that doctors were\nBeing put out of work well the most egregious example that comes to mind as a couple of months old\nWhen Trump was talking about him is Thirteen Salvadoran ruthless Salvadoran gangs that commits unspeakable atrocities and Trump called them animals of the media jumped all over that term and portrayed it as if he was describing\nAll Mexican immigrants as animals and it was such an egregious depiction and even the New York times had to backtrack\nAnd issue an apology that's typical of the way that the left tries to portray conservatives because the point of that article was that\nConservatism is not extreme in any way it's the center of the political spectrum and the left the more left you go the more totalitarian you go the more freedoms are curtailed and if you want to recognize the political spectrum\nIt's actually a range of governments going from total government or totalitarianism on the one hand and so the other extreme if one side is total government the other extreme has to be no government\nOr energy before we go there though you mentioned that Democrats are supposedly champions of the middle class while conservatives are in some cases Republicans are portrayed as as radical and favoring the one percent but does the left to actually do anything that helps people of lesser means\nThey talk a good game but all you have to do is look at the urban poverty plantations\nIn cities that have been run by the last four decades and you see the conditions do not improve and one of the most impressive lines I thought\nDuring the presidential campaign is when Trump was addressing black audiences and pointing out the conditions and the way things have gone for decades and asking for their vote and said to them\nWhat if you got to lose\nAnd for many people that was a wakeup call ... and it was absolutely right they'd been voting the same way for decades and getting the same horrid results yeah the animal you have to do is look at what's been going on for the last\nCouple of years and black and Hispanic unemployment are at their lowest levels in history right now do you see any fair portrayals of that and the media\nNow I I Do hear portrayals of it occasionally specifically on NPR they have talked about that and I've heard them top mention it but but then usually hasten to ascribe it to some other cars or to ensure it made it to the voter rolls on earth to Obama and his chief yeah you know anything is said\nDuring the entire Obama administration everything bad was attributed to Bush\nAnd now during the Trump Administration they're trying to attribute anything good ... good reminds me of all I Know that one of my favorite comedians from my family when I was a kid was Jackie Mason and he had a great line you know he comes out to great applause any says thanks thanks I\nIt's always nice to come out after such a terrific performers the one just before me because last week I followed a guy that was so bad\nDuring my entire show they kept the booing him\n[laughter] that's a little too Jewish for me to to go Jackie Mason the question is\nHow could a movement which highlights liberty and limited government possibly be considered extremists so Barney while how well that's the\nKey it's not it's portrayed because we don't have a media in this country that reports on anything objectively but when you have an ideology\nThat promotes limited government rule of law free enterprise private property personal responsibility\nThat is limited government as opposed to no government anarchy or totalitarian government limited government is right in the center and what I just described as a perfect depiction of conservatism and that's my case for conservatives in being in the center of the political spectrum\nThis vote until after the election that they hope is going to go in their favor I suspect that they're in for quite a rude awakening and if you look behind the scenes at the orchestra ration that's going on with these hearings you get an idea of just what\nThe swamp as capable odds and I think it is an affront to most citizens the American citizen has an inherent appreciation for fairness and the left is\nSkewing the playing field dramatically so us what the best way to get back to it is\nLimited to limit the federal government to its enumerated powers it's simple to say hard to do Trump is doing working on doing not better than any president I kept\nHis he's more conservative Ronald Reagan was certainly\nIn his actions and the result of his actions I think ideologically Reagan\nWas solid conservative Trump is more of a populist but his policies are serving to promote and implement the conservative agenda like nothing we've seen and nothing we had a right to or even expect\nI Want to go back to something you said before which is significant you talked about sunshine being the best disinfectant and then there's Alexandria okay seal Cortez\nWho is not afraid of being to paraphrase ... where he said the naked communist she's not afraid to be the negative the socialist right exactly she just letting the political stuff all hang out yeah she's not afraid to be named for what she actually is a that's a huge paradigm shift used to be people ran away from being called\nThat she's not smart enough to know to do so and I'll tell you what the entire left with the exception of Bernie Sanders are screaming\nNo no no you know what you're saying to her shoes when after the election and slick deals on knowing the bean rights like the Obama and his chief\nTells Lana Merrill have more flexibility after the election\nLike going back to your article the Goldwater Institute recently suggested and got passed a piece of legislation in Arizona the governor do see sign which was house built twenty to thirty eight that ensures that individuals and businesses that appeal any unjust agency decisions\nWill have their cases reviewed fairly independently by the courts without deference to the agency's own interpretation of the law that's called the Chevron deference it directs courts to treat the cases the same as any other case without favoring the government\nAnd when the governor signed that bill Arizona becomes the first state\nTo level the playing field for private entities versus government and reject the requirement to court simply accept the government's biased interpretation of a statute as I said known as the Chevron\nDeference now again this is only at the state level it's a microcosm of laboratory of liberty and one of the fifty laboratories of liberty is a former business owner what effect do you think that might have in beating back the government overreach and do you think that if that philosophy where to spread throughout the country that it could eventually reverberate in the halls of Congress\nWe can only hope [laughter] slow there's a book that's out there called three felonies a day mhm and government overreach has gone to the point\nWhere we're actually installing US Territories or was it barrier that said show me the man and I'll show you the crime\nWas it barrier that said show me the man and I'll show you the crime government has become so invasive that\nLike you mentioned earlier in New York City you're prohibited from buying soda of a certain size and the government regulates our bathrooms our bedrooms are light bulbs our kitchens that's a far cry from how this government was initially set up so\nI like this leveling the playing field where it's not automatically\nIt should be the citizens word that is given equal or preferential weight over the out of the government\nWhat do you make of the new trade deals with Mexico and Canada see an S.\nU. S. C. M. may on believable great timing over a month before the election\nAnother promise made promises kept NAFTA was pushing in the direction of bigger government the U.S deferring and giving away two others unnecessarily Trump pledged to stop that\nAnd he has spectacularly and it just cracks me up that as we were getting to the deadline for Canada they jumped on board met rather than missing that train because we have an international agreement that benefits American workers and not additionally will resent around at the ballot box next month\nMade reference earlier to both Iran and North Korea you made reference earlier to North Korea and also to Iran do you think that the fact that countries are moving in our direction in terms of trade may also raised around to the benefit of deals with bringing Iran to the table and also bringing North Korea to heal\nWell we certainly hope so but this administration has had so much success and implementing the agenda that they campaigned on I wouldn't be surprised if with the pressure that Trump is putting on Iran with the sanctions\nI wouldn't be surprised if they are violently against their will force to the table they are fundamentally different North Korea because they are a theocracy\nAnd they have the doctrine that they cannot deviate from ... will be interesting to see is there any exploding heads there if they actually [laughter]\nI'll take figurative as well but if they have to be forced into position actually I suspect not I hope not\nWhat I'm hoping for over there is such unrest within the population that the regime is forced to fall that would be astonishing\nI'm not so certain that the policy in Iran has that much influence on the leadership of the country I'm not so sure that they won't buy just simple rule of force override the pilot and enforce the will of the mullahs upon the population the question is how much power do the people actually have an Iran\nWell that's exactly what they did in June two thousand nine in the green revolution when the our prior administration had the perfect opportunity to support the people of Iran and and not just blew the opportunity\nI don't think they ever gave a damn or had that on their agenda was never an opportunity they would have wanted to even arrives let alone take advantage of I just have to shake my head at\nThe things that are being accomplished and I have to say if it weren't for a few perhaps poorly chosen words\nThis\nMight be close to being the perfect twenty first century president\n[laughter] yeah I think the previous administration had the mullahs on the rug and they need only to reach down and grab the rug and yank real hard in Iran would have had a new government and these guys are not only did blew the opportunity I don't think the objected in principle to the mullahs being the most I really don't\nKnow I mean obviously in the way they count towel to them for common aiding in this disastrous Iran deal right which Trump wisely pulled us out of yeah I think there's going to be a huge backlash at the ballot box next month\nAnd so I'm looking forward to a rude awakening for the last and another happy day like we had in November twenty sixteen\nI just can't wait to see the look on Rachel Maddow space that depressed look it gives shot in Florida a new name that's all the time we have for now
