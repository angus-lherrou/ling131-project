dot com on line and ah it is a terrific it's a nonprofit independent news organization ... little bit about it\n[noise] yeah so it is um you know our goal is really to cover politics and and and public policy or in Arizona but tried to do it in a little bit of a different way you know I've my background is in politics public policy I was\nWith at the Arizona capital times for a last Thirteen Years something like that um and you know and you know I\nWorking there you know we we did a lot of really great in depth coverage of what was happening at the state capital\nA and and I I I left there and I took over the Arizona Center for investigative reporting and was there for almost two years and you know really when I wanted to to find an opportunity to find a way to take some of the\nSome of the the storytelling and and some of the the the journalism techniques that I'd I'd learned over an easy CIA are and and really apply it directly to politics and public policy and and and be able to to cover those important issues that are there issues that are important but they're really I think fundamentally not interesting to a lot of people\n[laughter] you know as important as they are as\nMuch direct effect as they have on people's lives it's tough to get people engaged in them and and so what we really I I think our goal is to try to do is to to to cover\nPublic policy at the state level in in something of a new way and and and really try to to put a human face on it and try to to tell the tale stories that actually resonate with\nWith people who are otherwise consumed with their jobs and they're in their daily lives and don't have a lot of a lot of room to follow politics the way you know a nerve like need my er and and and and try to get people\nTo understand the importance of of why it matters what happens to the state capital why it matters who your governor is or who your state legislator is uh or or even you know\nWho your who your city councilor who your school board representative those things you know really do matter and they they really those the people who create policies that are going to affect your life in day in and day out of that but unfortunately it's you know it is very tough to get people interested in and I think\nA lot of that has to do with the way that the way the media covers those issues and and\n... and and in particular the way that that reporters tend to talk to other people who are already paying attention\nWell that's what I mean as as opposed to people who you know might check in on a political story or a week or once a month\nAnd you bring up a good point about and we've all been trying to figure this out how to you cover the boring but important in ways that matter to people but uh we're going to get into

Jeremy due to them what my my associate editor you know dug into what exactly what's going on here and do a lot of the corporate records\nYou know in terms of turned up the fact that this was at a company to basically trying to\nPiggy back on the election to to get some free free advertising to get some some exposure ah with some science that that are illegal but blend into a lot of other campaign signs and so I'll probably not going to be taking that said he told officials ah and\nProbably not going to be taking that my city cold officials are and and even though they are they're definitely I mean there there's no legal like for these things to stand on I mean\nBut the trend or an Asian or driving around is not going to like take the initiative to start pulling these things up right\nProbably not I mean they might now they've gotten some media attention\nSo I'm not sure which is what they were looking for in the first place which is so it would work for it right you know so I'm\nCertainly our story was you know and and the blood thoughts we wrote on it was was effectively you know with these things are these things are scams you do get into this don't they'll they'll give these people any you know any attention and just know that these things are illegal and and my my hope is certainly the city code enforcement is going to go out there and in certain pole and these things\nLike click bait on the on the roadside there so\nI Know and and but it's it's a weird strategy right because I I don't know how many of you guys have run into people will say God I really love campaign season 'cause I Love seeing\nAll [laughter] everywhere they just white enough the intersection has their own um and and so after I wrote yeah yeah and and\nSo it's it's kind of a weird you know I I get to the science get to stay up because they blend in with the other things that are out there but there are things that blend in with the things that people generally I think dislike and complain about so it's kind of an odd I'm an odd way to promote your business is to say hey look we're doing that thing that you hate everyone else for doing\nAnd your your site or you've got a lot of topics education immigration politics law government investigations things like that but you're also doing some commentary and you just wrote a piece and the headline is due Latinos make Arizona worse conservatives and Republicans\nThink so and so now you are walking this fine line between your the news guy\nAnd you were the opinions guy and I do that by the way I'm Still uncomfortable with it\nBut it's but it has to be done because you need both you know what you're wearing when you're doing it though I Do but it is a you and I were talking earlier about how trust is everything you know with a ... if you don't have their trust and it took me awhile to build the trust to do that but\nYou guys are Jim right out of the gate you're you're writing commentary and uh how how are you deciding what you're covering and\nHow strong it's dance or you're going to take in the future will you guys do you ever see your cells endorsing propositions or candidates anything like that\nUm you know we're certainly not this time I mean I I don't know we we don't have an editorial boards or say to\nYou know it's really kind of weigh in on those things um it's something we might evaluate in the future I you know for writing for right now I mean the the opinion pieces are\nUm primarily in the coming from me and and I think we'll have some some other guests columnist on and gifts in writers who are who are going to come in either on a regular semi regular basis to provide some opinions um\nYou know is it in terms of um you know deciding what to cover I mean one of the the great things about doing something like this is you know we've got\nWe've got full editorial in it and and you know our job as professionals is a couple of the things that that that we see that are important and the stories you know especially the ... the stories that are important that just aren't getting told elsewhere and that that no one else is is seeing recovery\nUm you know in in in terms of the the thing is that you're right I mean that trust is is important um you know and and and how far you go with that I I think it's a challenge\nUm for for me I mean my Ninety percent of I think the writing that I'll do will probably end up being opinion pieces as opposed to to do is just because of my role as an editor and I I I'll be the primary columnist I guess for lack of a better work uh for for our operation um you know and him and then my job\nBe up on that is going to be directing the news coverage and working with the reporters and editors stories and and getting stuff like that up um [noise] uh you know um but the you know I I think opinions\nAre they're they're important I think to um you know both to help to help inform people I mean I think that\nIf you do opinion writing might think it's not just labyrinth I think it's it's you know being able to tell a story and doing ... you know within ... within your in your writing\nAnd doing some real analysis and showing your work rather than oh here's what I Believe because all\nCs and that's so important and you have to help with community set the agenda and understand what's important to them and everything but Jim because your expertise I Want to uh through one last question that you signed up for us the mix Sally cinema Senate race\nBoy it's going to be I think this was going to be ... um you know a cinema has had the early advantage I think in this race um and I think\nIn there are the two questions right there how much of an undecided voter is there I still would at this point say that in the major races it's probably under five percent really do not know what they're going to do when they get to the polls\nIf you're sending you don't know you're probably not going to take the time to deal with it\nAnd there's a bigger question getting people out to the polls which a gym was saying and you were to uh that uh it's all about turnout this time and so\nUh getting the people who have decided to actually go to the polls so lots of things to look for in a in this mid term election that's one of them are you a ... more like who who writes for you was not impressed with Nick Pearson and he is a Republican candidate\nIn CD three going up against role ... and he had an interesting column where it's basically a good luck\nBecause Raul is almost unbeatable I have not figured out why but\nOther Republicans have never really been able to put up somebody I'm against him at the last time was two thousand ten Ruth ... came pretty close to knocking them off and that was the year of the Tea Party yeah and then pretty close means ah ten points yeah ... ...\nWhich in you know or other races would be a a landslide\nYeah he was nervous that you can say that you asked a truly did she have a chance or what we thought Jesse Kelly almost be Gabby Giffords then and that would that would have been a surprising that one came right down to the wire but what is what's what's blitz message and all this\nUm yeah more or less are what the devil will tell you call this a points out his uh takes that a road ... is just you firmly entrenched into the college e Blake wrote and uh\nOn feeding him is pretty much a suicide mission or you you you know and it's probably not going to happen and it certainly won't happen if Republicans continue to run a\nI Can't say Nick Pearson is terrible he's no Joe Sweeney or anything like that you write up the perennial candidate to ah just made a complete a foolish shambles out of a series of elections but he's not a good solid candidate much less a great candidate and it would take a great candidate somebody who really\nKnows the details and demonstrates that they are ready to step in and do the job and in that debate here in\nA really\nThat he doesn't get the details he couldn't say any of the committees he might want to serve on he pretty much going against the message of the Republican Party he said that there should be a universal standard for drinking water at the federal level and we've kind of their\nHead at Nineteen Seventy three\nYou know you know as a good point in his column too but you know I call him in my own mind I've never said it publicly but the ... of of this race and she is a Democrat who is in the city to primary who on paper looked absolutely awesome\nBut was not a I felt like she was somewhat of a weak campaign or and all I don't think it would\nBe almost a mirror image actually yeah I could very muddy a has a link the resume extensive experience terrific news ah incredible details about how the federal government works\nBecause she helped run large chunks of it right but yet she was not a you know the most dynamic of campaigners certainly and didn't get jobs because of that\nAnd that was an unfortunate because I really kind of thought that she was going to catch fire and uh and really challenging for Patrick can agree agree with her policy\nStatements or not you couldn't deny that she knows all heck of a lot of heat is\nAbsolutely that's what I'm saying on paper she was a pretty strong candidate so are you had a a interesting story by Betty beard who wrote about jobs growth and\nBasically saying Arizona is flush with jobs more jobs than people who are moving into the state which we're getting an awful lot of them and this is good news for Arizona I guess\nWell I mean do do you need you need to have jobs whether those jobs are in the right places at the right wages is another story right but we are getting close\nTo what economists call a functional full employment the unemployment rate or did a a\nBump up last month I think it was a tenth of a point\nBut uh the uh state economists are pointing out that most people who are actively looking for a job or a only on the job market for a month or five weeks or so in a managed to ah find themselves that position so were there were always be people who don't have jobs you wouldn't have a job market\nSo we're ... there were always be people who don't have jobs you wouldn't have a job market if there weren't people looking for work and employers looking to hire people so you you need to have a you know a little bit of a flux going on there so that the that the system actually works but\nArizona is growing it's a number of open positions and a number of fill positions actually I should say\nFaster than the number of people who are moving here which is a you know probably a good thing\nAnd it's definitely a good thing you just don't want the word to get out that you can't feel that the job demands but as you were saying where are those jobs and a ... and do they pay in ... and the\nThe fact that employers are having to search a little bit harder does put some upward pressure on wages\nAnd the in the Phoenix area when and I grew up in that area is a lot more expensive than it used to be and that really surprises me every time I go back there have zero desire to to head back to\nYou know that pile of people but it is far inland as ... but you know kind of where the where the action is but I Wonder if it's going to lose its a label as being very very affordable is Arizona has\nAlways been in retrospect it of course you compare yourself to California and the east coast pretty much anybody is going to look for to dramatically affordable here comparing herself to coastal California but it's getting up there and ah so that's a little bit of a\nLittle bit of surprise I Want to take us down to a motto now about an hour ago I talked to a check Huckleberry the county administrator and there's still a little befuddled and maybe a little surprised at the lack of response from a dad\nWho has the responsibility of cleaning out under bridges and we're talking specifically about the so pre wash bridge\nAnd uh on September second those Labor Day weekend we had a huge amount of rain down in that area it comes roaring down the wash and it hits a ten foot wall under the slippery wash bridge which was supposed to be cleared in his eight ounce responsibility\nIs all the the debris the tree limbs and well stuff that's piled up there over the years right\nAnd it is um it's really hard packed dirt and there's actually a tree growing out of it which tells me that uh and there's one person who's been on a person's Santa Cruz county said that he thinks it's been Nineteen years 'cause that's along has been on the job but he's ever seen it cleared out so we're going after eight out and saying what's going on here\nOr why wasn't this cleared up now I Want to be clear that number one this was an almost unprecedented\nRainfall down there in the short amount of time and so it was the rainfall that was the true culprit but the fact is the wash it's designed to do certain things and there was an awful lot of dirt built up there so it has to this point not taken responsibility we've been hammering their communications team we're done with that because they are\nUm it's very clear that this was going to the legal department and uh that is above their pay grade and we'll see how it responds to this but we have a couple of business owners down there who are\nReally suffering as a result the cow palace which is a Ninety eight year old historic restaurant in that area\nOr may not reopen no decision yet it has not been condemned and saying that I'm just saying that it is it really hard hit hard and they still haven't worked out the insurance and who knows whether\nAnything from the state might help out and I'm Talking in terms of some sort of deal with with eight out and I don't know how quickly ada moves but being a the bureaucracy of a state agency probably not real fast so if you\nIf you look at the number of people whose job it is to inspect bridges and keep track of these things there are a precious few running around this very large state and even though we don't have a lot of flowing rivers here we do have a whole lot of bridges\nYou and you would hope that at least once every Nineteen years someone could get over there and said hey maybe we could claim this out so we'll see actually this is what happened so we're still asking questions and looking for a requesting records and\nHaving a public agency they have to give them up but a lot of times they'll they'll drag their feet so we'll see actually what what happens and I want to contrast this with Freeport Mac around which is the the mine down on the edge of green valley there were a couple of dust events couple of weeks ago\nAnd they are sending the cause of death over the community and into homes\nAnd uh this they\nAre immediately acknowledge that it was their responsibility and their failure to do what they were supposed to do to keep in mind tailings where I'm On their own property which is what the law says\nAnd they have responded um valiantly and gone in there cleaning homes and their inside and out by the way and making it right so it's very interesting at least to a huge entities and one responds one way and one response\nOr the other of course with Freeport we had hundreds and hundreds of pictures of dust coming to mind and it was a little hard to uh to uh ignore so\nWell in nuts you know a a company that subject to regulation by the feds and by the state and ah you know they're a little bit more of the a letter to a push 'em to get them to respond if they don't troubled themselves to whereas a state agency\nAnd who knew Miranda had so much to offer we got about Fifteen seconds here\nYeah the Miranda ... you're going to be A Guided through Iran as four

book Hugh ... is that the last ... is always putting out things into the culture right here's a here's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty notes\nThere's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty no kid would would look at it it's for adults to make fun of the president and to feel morally superior I wrote my book because I thought we don't have things like that\nOn the right for conservative to want to celebrate what America is who believe loyal Reagan was a great man I think that we need stuff like that and I get\nVery upset because you just got a tweet from Jamie ... who is you know kind of a never Trump Bernie was just on the show earlier and I tell you that you are coming up to talk about your book

culture right\nStephen Colbert has a talk show tons of people like that have talk shows we don't have anybody effectively speaking who have talk shows like that I wrote this children's book because I

actually proud of some of this stuff he's getting done and why don't we why don't we talk about it I mean people go there is not going to help me on the show to talk about it\nBut I got to tell you this is the kind of thing this is the reason I wrote the book don't drain the swamp is meant to be a cultural\nObject we have to get our side of the story out there and this is one of the ways we do
