way to ... an ounce been on the show I appreciate\n... thank you thank you I'm learning oh my gosh there's so much that is writing this book was nothing compared to all this stuff for the motion and the media side of it yes oh there's so much to do\nSo we tease this by saying eleven years yes you've been kind of I don't even totally right it was eleven year project what is your first one of the first started coming in were you covered it\nYeah I've heard it for the Tucson Citizen the late great Tucson Citizen\nI'm and I'm In there were two trials Dr Schwartz and Bruce bigger and in between the trials a publisher called me and said the words that every journalist wants to hear how'd you like to write a book and I said he's putting me on [laughter]\nAnd he said no I'm Serious and so um so we had to wait until after the boats trials wherever and then I'm over the course of about three months um because I had all the research because I've been covering the the case from the beginning\nAnd um and I just had to put it in book form which I enjoyed so much she was so nice to get out of that newspaper ... twelve to Fifteen inch story grown actually tell a fuller story\nAnd um and so I wrote it and it didn't get published um for for various reasons and um so then I kind of put it on a back burner because at the time the citizen was going through its debts throws right\nAnd so everybody was worried about their jobs their future what they wanted to do\nAnd I I knew that I wanted to go off in the direction of being my own writer but didn't know quite how to do that but in the meantime I put the manuscript on the back burner and touch it up now and then and I get calls are these discovery id shows would call me up and say hey we're doing a story on this and\nAnd um and even in the last three years I got an you know I've gotten several calls about this case and I asked one of the producers\nIt's it's been so long since the case happened you're doing a story on this you know why and um the producer said well\nThe people involved you can't make this stuff up around you have this young brilliant well like I surgeon who is found slain stabbed to death in the parking lot of his medical complex and then they\nBab to death in the parking lot of his medical complex and then made and that was the first in Britain river river up right across from a ... yeah and um and then they accused another eye surgeon of hiring a hit man and a most unlikely hit men at that why would likely\nI'm Well Bruce bigger he did not have a history of violence and most of the violence in his past were getting involved you know fights getting beaten up he seemed to get beat beaten up a lot\nAnd um and so it it's not like he and he's not a career criminal he was a drug addict who got into trouble right and so ... not the kind of person that you would think would be hired to um to kill someone out earlier\nDr Schwartz allegedly asked his girlfriend fiance ex lord is Lopez's ex husband\nTo kill doctors to them and Danny Lopez was kind of a nefarious character involved in crime you've been married for a prosecutor yes that one time at one time yeah\nAnd so allegedly he ... Dr Schwartz asked him to kill doctors that um and you can kinda see that and he was not you know like I said he was a um pretty much a career criminal and then he turns up dead himself so he got killed in a\nI don't want to ruin the book review she read the book talks with rage murder Taylor murder in Tucson\nWhat um what about ... drove\nSchwartz to this you have foreign who\nLives but yet but I'm going to hire someone to kill yeah an eye surgeon yeah I'm Dr Schwartz was practicing\nHere in Tucson and he he wanted to um have someone else take over the children's um a practice in his office right and so he advertise and brands to them saw that advertisement he was in Texas is native Texas\nAnd so I'm Dr Schwartz hired Dr stood them to take over the children's practice about a year after a doctor stood um got here\nI'm Dr Schwartz had been self medicating himself would like it in for the physical ailments and writing prescriptions out to lord is Lopez for several hundred\nBy kittens and other people also and he and he got caught the feds cost him right and they raided the office Dr stood him got scared and said oh my gosh what have I gotten myself into and started to break away from the practice while Dr Schwartz was going through his federal court case\nAnd and in the meantime eventually would lose his medical um license and privileges and so I'm according to prosecute it prosecutors\nThis this situation built up a toxic rage in Dr Schwartz so that he wanted Dr stood in either you wanted his um to get him in trouble so his license was taken away and he couldn't practice or killed right\nAnd apparently asked a lot of people have do you know someone who can take out someone else and um they had a whole parade of witnesses who said yeah he told me this but I didn't believe I'm sure and even lord us Lopez who became his that that was at the time of the trials his ex fiance became his main accuser\nAnd the person who kind of went to um through the channels as a former prosecutor she knew all the the cops and lawyers and everything involved and she went to them and said this was what I Know about but what he told me over the months that this happened\nWhen you start looking at Schwartz who background and history and other than getting hooked on bike to them 'cause of physical ailments that wasn't anything in his upbringing history that would point to the fact that\n... something like this to that point no he came from a a a family that\nWas um ... that was well off I don't I don't think they were rich but um he went to good schools um he had a thriving practice\nUm he had a pretty messed up personal life um he likes the ladies and it broke up his marriage and he had you know a bunch of relationships um but but no there was nothing you know dogs are with\nAn ego I never heard of that I Know I Know I Know someone came up\nTo me what a colleague said that oh well he was our child's doctor I Know he did this because he told us there to people who can fix your child God and me and God's busy and you're right well that doesn't mean to have someone killed [laughter] but no there was nothing that would have suggested\n\nNovel bikes wants to invite you in for a cup of coffee and browse around especially if you've never been in before if you like the coffee what are the chances you'd like the good service

thought supervise from back east celebrate number talent American greatness what'd you say oh I thought you talk without your microphone on I Would have been amazing\nOh All right let's talk about something called prop for sixty three\nNow if you want to check out\nThe um\n\nOur wake up to sun YouTube page I Want you to go over to ... dot com you'll see a link to it on the radio page\nAnd if you listen to the show\nGary Davidson and I have covered how Pima County and Allie Miller too supervisor Miller and I have done it the Pima County has got plenty of money to pay for some roads but they can't fix or a weird situation if people ask me why\nAnd I don't know if anyone ever asked I mean ... band on the show but you know Coca Cola bedtime is on bill show someone asked him why why can't you fix road\nYeah I understand the state but why can't you fix the road with the money you have\nIt's bizarre so what happened was uh the folks at the Hispanic Chamber\nGovernment Affairs Committee heard Gary on the show and asked to ... go over there and do a little bit of an explanation of why he thinks they know vote on four sixty three has wanted so Gary said yes\nNow Gary not retired carries an investment guy he works He has a gate Davidson investments this guy so the idea that he took out a morning out of his time to go do this\nProbably costs Gary little money and and and as time as valuable but he wanted to go and do it\nSo I guess what happened was originally one of the folks at the Hispanic Chamber wanted to have someone from the Transportation Department I Believe originally this is what I'm hearing a to come on and just explain the bond and blah blah blah\nAnd okay so that's what we're expecting guest Gary showing up representing himself he's not part of the new one for sixty three Gary will tell you he was a taxpayer he's a citizen of Pima County and he has served on the bomb and the parks committee for years\nAnd uh\nYou know this this this is\nThis is his concerns about giving these guys more money so he gets there I don't know how many people are on the committee you I'm I'm sure it's like I don't know between seven and eleven\nPeople on there I don't know if someone's on that we're sending making Tex me call me and what happens when Gary good there is Pima County and the Chuck Huckleberry paranoia team is there\nWe got a window long who is your son\nThen we had to have a supervisor Ramon followed those also there\nOh and we had Pima County a lobbyist Michael Rafi they're\nSo from what I hear it sounded like Rossi did most of the talking or at this thing which is so funny that the county paid lobbyist is sitting there trying to show for sixty three down your throat\nBut that's not considered use of county resources which is so funny\nRight right so\nTaxpayers pay money to Pima County Pima County uses the taxpayer money to pay the lobbyist and a lobbyist is that a government Affairs Committee trying to shove the bomb down your\nThroat and tell you the trucks great and that's not a use of county resources\nNow Chuck was trying to you know have all the lawyers tell anyone who served on the transportation advisory committee that\nYou'd better watch out on how you sign off on anything that you say you represent 'cause there can be legal problems\nBut there's no legal problems with the lobbyist doing this\nSo the I what's so funny is the idea that it took five of them versus one Garry\nI don't know how many of the other people smoke but the idea that the show up with a supervisor wanted Chuck supervisors Wendell long and the lobbyist against Gary\nIs hilarious and classic Pima County overkill\nThat a lot of money a lot of people working All right\nBut again none of that as use of taxpayer dollars okay\nSo let's go to\nYou know this is like a\nBook by giving yourself a headache okay\nSo Ramon followed those okay hold on we're going to do this let's see Ramon ... will come up with this is this is even more boring than a calculator on the air Google Search on the air is even worse okay\nNow ought to do let's do this Ramon ... now I Know I've read his tweets right all of his amazing\nAmong

chapter in there you betcha um is ah what kind of music do you like the you're when you're preparing someone's taxes what's the music\nYou like listen to the music in my head so quiet yes okay\nI Know

what about folks with rental income they get to do anything against that income\nYes that is an excellent question by the ask that of the property tax for the rent polls still goes with the rental income it is not subject to that ten thousand dollar by imitation\nVery good at clear and to folks was rental income wall welcome news\nInterview by Barney things will get questions or thank you guys\nSeven nine zero two zero four zero the phone number wake up to sun at Gmail dot com when it happens to be um\nThe business side of the tax cuts who are going to make out better and then we'll get the who makes a little worse before there's a so who's going to make a better in the in the business world how's the weather some of the benefits on the tax cuts in that side\nOh there's a lot of benefits of all the tax side the biggest benefit that you probably are hurt a lot about of course they lower the corporate tax rates are that mainly helps the a publicly traded companies\nBecause a lot of small businesses are not seek corps they're escorts\nFor stocks and bonds\nSo you could look that up I don't know exactly what\nYou said it was a mutual fund there there should be historical data on line\nOkay a second question I Want to ask is I'm I'm a working person and I just work and and it seems like every year might try and get better and better in my town basically says that\nYou really don't have any deductions anymore I mean I own a home so really as a single person it seems like the only three adoptions that I really get home mortgage a charity that seems to I mean that's all I Am I missing something\nI'm no that's pretty much what you get I mean you can does after tax prep for the uh it it used to that any more um\nAnd with the low mortgage interest rates your mortgage might not be helping you very much\nSo unless you give a lot to charity with this doubling of the standard deduction you may be in a situation where you won't be either by using this year\nOkay All right thank you\nThank Jim have a good day you don't have a nine zero twenty forty you have to have his me seems like a lot of us might be in that position this year oh yeah so that we cannot deduct anymore they they anticipate\nA I Believe the number was about eighty percent of the people that used to itemize won't be I'd advise any\nAgain that's why 'cause ... that's why they've doubled your standard Mm So what's the standard deduction now it's almost doubled it for a married couple it'd be Thirteen thousand under the old law it's twenty four thousand now and for a single person that would be sixty five hundred butter though laws twelve thousand oh gotcha\nOkay so you can do it standard induction for a couple of twenty four thousand yes so that's where the that's that's why you got to go through the exercise correct correct them now one of the things to do and I were talking about I said this in the first hour from now don't wait until the week between Christmas and New Year's\nI'm going to say between now in December ... the next sixty days should be your tax planning discussion time absolutely this is it this is where the rubber hits the road especially with\nNew stuff coming down the line you may need to readjust how you're doing your stuff in illegal manner to make sure you don't get hammered because you're you're the way you're doing your stuff is different than what it's going to be where are you going to be benefiting and the tax law\nIn the spring correct correct and and I encourage every one of the listeners out there to call their tax professional and have a conversation with them now\nAnd I encourage every one of the listeners out there to call their tax professional it have a conversation with them now while they're slower to find out if there is anything that you can do to reduce\nOr benefit more from the tax law as an example of the\nI had a a physician that also had a sold\nA he had a pharmacy in in a\n... of the office right and the physician did not qualify for the one night and I did the duck ship but the pharmacy ward right but right now they were under one of ...\nSo we separated them into two separate businesses so that we could take advantage of\nThe uh one added a deduction Mars example part yes\nAnd and those kinds of things need to be done as soon as possible so have that conversation there may be something that you can do now to maximize the benefit or minimize the the detriment of your taxes when I was\nListening to you watching you on\nThe answering the question to gyms question right I've thought about one of the things that students hate\nOur math word problems right correct right the classic the train is leaving Chicago going a hundred and twenty three miles a train leaving but the ... the gift the that whole thing right well when you take a question like that you are doing the ultimate math problem without looking at anything exactly so I was both impressed than sympathetic\nJoel Rose CPA um what is something on the business side of the new tax cuts and the new tax codes\nHere that's another thing that if you're not paying attention you could get things coming up in the spring what does something on the business side here that's something that people could get things done up they're not paying attention and just doing the same thing they did the last so many years\nWell I mean what they was taken away of in the in the tax law that\nYou may have been benefiting from the last few years is called a domestic production activity deduction\nWhich is a very nice deduction and it's primarily for manufacturers and and the term is very loosely held I mean they could be a software company developing software or something but uh the\nThat is no longer a deduction and that could have that has historically been a very nice deduction for a lot of people a lot of people at the construction industry\nBuilt deep had as we call it that around that stick production activity deduction correct correct like a twisted Dr seuss I'm uh right now\nSo what so basically so they just they just eliminated that they did so are there is there any other place you could be making that up and doing what in relation to what you're doing where it's just you know sometimes there are certain things where they kind of certain things do get a different adoption and is there any of that will\nLove and they're all well that's why you need to sit down with your tax professional and look at your situation ... because there may be a opportunities there that you can take advantage of\nAnd the uh 'cause a lot of things there are so many strategies available at the tax code both for individuals but especially for business owners\nThat a lot of people don't take advantage of because they don't know about and write hopefully your tax professional is\nIs up to date and asked\nTo do about a lot of the strategies that's why the book is so beneficial for a business owners because it talks about some of the lesser known strategies that maybe your tax professional doesn't talk about or maybe ... doesn't even know about\nSo again you can get this book Joe's place doesn't rose tax on twenty second now um what other things are are there any other things on the business side of the stuff\nThat we should be that you want to get out for people right now where it was something that they should be aware of\nWell the main thing all the business side that the other than the iPad is actually that they took away\nThat it does affect a lot of people as a as I've had a lot of phone calls about it is the entertained but the doctrine out meals are still the doctor all\nThe way they were fifty percent but entertainment is no longer adoption and as an example in Tucson a big entertainment expense is season tickets to the Wildcats\nAnd I've got a lot of phone calls about people that are used to buy those season tickets and you know they pass about to clients and everything so some of\nThe subject [laughter]\nSo you need to look at how you're defining entertainment and making sure that you're not calling up the entertainment that might be a better categorized as marketing expenses of I mean if if I were to give\nTickets to a Broadway show to a client as a thank you gift it could be a gift it it could also be a business promotional thing right um it doesn't have to be\nConsidered entertainment but there again you need to look at the facts and circumstances of the individual\nSo pretty much if you're doing the same thing as part of the business one you should be actually giving tickets away the clients right and keeping track\nOf you giving those tickets alive right cause I assume if you gave fifty percent of the tickets that you have for a season ticket you're only on that you really should only the duck fifty percent of those tickets would that be right\nWith that that would be logically right whether it's a right and the tax code you\nWere that are looked at logic and socks coated the same thing I mean we have to look at\nThe facts and circumstances to determine that each each situation is going to be different gifts also keep in mind are limited in there about I think it's a twenty five dollars\nThat you can't get more than twenty five dollars as a gift so ah okay so keep all those things that by that and talk to your tax professional now during this tax plan he sees it to see\nWhether or not you'd need to change your operations a little bit to be able to keep from falling through the cracks all this\nAll right let's do this I Want to go one more break when we come back we haven't talked about medical expenses someone to talk about that and also some of the stuff with for some of our more seasoned citizens in relation to Social Security Medicare Obamacare", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson - Chris DeSimone & Joe Higgins", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "08"}
