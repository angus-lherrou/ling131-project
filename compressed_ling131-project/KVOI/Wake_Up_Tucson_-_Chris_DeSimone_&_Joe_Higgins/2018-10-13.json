Tucson a spoiler alert\nIn our co workers so if you're looking for hard hitting questions about the film industry may not happen today but we we do want to talk about all the exciting things happening in southern Arizona film\nThat is it hasn't been a good year for Tucson film or we we finished that visit us on our fiscal year in July how did it go and went very well oh well there you go yes [laughter] ah we had um nine\nMillion over nine million indirect spending from all the\nProductions that came in so that includes\nA indie feature films a TV series which I'll get back to a what we call episodic and that's where a single episode of a TV show comes in so it could be a cooking show from the food network or a nature documentary from National Geographic what have you um episodic bringing a lot it's I'm pretty much our number one\nUh so we had a ... almost six thousand job days\nOr so that's a job days that includes um hotels or hair makeup lighting grip sound all the local crew that get hired um so we had a very good year I'm a lot of that came from a TV series which not many of you know about and it's okay if you don't because uh\nIt only plays in Mexico at the TV series called run coyote run\nA they shot their first season here a couple of years ago and this past fiscal year they shot season to a it's a a cross border comedy or they don't part of in Mexico and part of in America here in uh on along our border along the Dallas and I'm\nNot go and uh they use a lot of Tucson crew a lot of Tucson services a\nTV series are totally ... you want to get because it is episode after episodes going back to back and they spend a lot of money um so that's part of why we had such a good year run Cary run a only ears in Mexico so I've actually never seen it but I'm told it's very\nFun and it's very popular in Mexico so season three is gearing up a long way if we want\nTo have it should be The Simpsons of Mexican tell well maybe not The Simpsons but still we often smoke All right we would love either an evil all of that uh yeah\nAnd of course the main thing that comes up I mean you've you've heard this ever want her to we had it on the on the buildup Esther show Facebook page somebody mentioned you know why why as you know Netflix has investing and New Mexico all ends up\nIn the big elephant in the room always what these phone conversations at least to me by what people tell me is the incentive is she right yes so\nThere's obviously a fair amount of discussion about whether incentives are valuable are the things that other correct well they're certainly valuable and bringing film\nOr the long term effects of it ... your this off the others you and Shelley hall in his office mhm to people and nine point eight million dollars of direct spending and then there's that's just the amount that actually being spent by the productions\nDirectly right away and so there is sort of these ancillary things that come out mhm from around that as well\nHow ... without incentives and without the sort of impending likelihood of statewide incentives where where does your you mentioned Mexican ... you know Mexican Mexican film industry where does where do you go next you know where where do you see the growth\nIn the expanding that nine million to twelve Fifteen whatever it is sure a\nLet me just back up a little bit in just for those that don't know what we're talking about with incentives are just a in a nutshell different states lure filmmakers to their region with tax breaks are so many of you that have seemed Breaking

on vacation her Stratford her ... for it is uh the I I'm trying to give you a title for the film fest Tucson her like what it is the executive director a major I don't know\nI I I'm you know I I don't get too hung up on titles but yeah I mean it's director and and and I guess found her I mean I did kind of started so yeah director and founder of some of\nOur ticket lovely talking to her by the way thank you thank you coming on the show on the bill Buckmaster show here on the voice\nAre you this I mean you you work too busy to talk to me but I Do appreciate your selling talk going on today a film festival in full swing last night the the pitch events correct was it was happening in the desert pitch how did that go\nIt went great we had a great uh we had a great time this is our second event that we've done the ... which basically in a nutshell is uh people are submit ideas for a film or television shows and uh and then the we invite to some people that come in and do their pitches in person and then\nWe have a a panel of out of town and kind of producers directors critics things like that and they narrow it down and then at the end of the night to somebody walks away without dollar check it out of a fun thing to watch\nWho doesn't like that and and the experience and experiences obviously the main thing there of ah getting in that space and having the opportunity to pitch and and do all that stuff is a is definitely a learned skill or of overtime it didn't\nGet it is and I think that's one of the things I think it's so great about it even if you don't have some edge to watch how people pitch to listen to the judge is it to you know tell them feedback and then you realize oh\nYou know I mean this is you're not usually in a room pitching professionals you know to get that far is pretty good so it's a great opportunity to come in and do that and so it was fun and we had a great winter and we were down at the AC Hotel in a nice to be there but yeah we're uh\nI'm calling you from the Scottish writes a cathedral right now and we're just finishing the set up of our of our for screening rooms here at the Scottish right 'cause we moved our outdoors screenings inside due to the weather and then we've got a things at the AC Hotel tonight also to their screening rooms\nAnd then Saturday we add the Fox theater or a special a couple of that's on Saturday Night so we're going to be on seven screens this year which is about twice as much as last year so\nWell that's a that's more work and I appreciate you doing it so this is your three of the of a film festival by my understanding I mean by my recollection and and people can find all this just to make sure so they know that film fest Tucson dot com fall schedule there as they can get their tickets they can find\nOut what they're doing there is a helpful grid that lets you know what's happening everywhere all the time it's super well designed a but it feels like I mean you know it does this is a bigger Catherine Hardwick on on Saturday and this is a a bigger it's an expansion of the of the vision of the festival at least to me\nIs it is and I think um and you know ... we've known each other for a long time I've um you know I I restore the Fox theater so I'm kind of a film guy and for a while I was ...\nUm you know I I restore the Fox theater so I'm kind of a film guy and for a while I was programming is apple valley film festival which had about twelve different venues in four towns\nSo I'm I'm a I'm trying to be very conscientious about\nUh how uh how our team build this festival and grows this festival and uh you know certainly there's there's there are other festivals that happen here in town but what we're doing is just a little bit different than so\nWe're we're excited about the way that the community has responded to this and and now we're going to continue to to expand in downtown and make this another fall classic much like a meat yourself for some of the things that have been around for a while this is that it's gonna be\nThere's going to be kind of a thing that everybody looks forward to and hopefully\nIs not only for for locals but leads to some some visits from out of town which is\nWhy you know for example like you mentioned the cats are hard way than they were doing she's doing a master class and of course she's a she was until recently the highest grossing female directors she directed Thirteen lords of dog pound the first twilight movies so she's an amazing action director\nUh but also were ah you know honoring her into actresses and then doing a screening of dark town but we\nWanted to ... if people have yeah no they need to go see dog town and it's so much fun\nAnd the director will be there this is the this is not a like a regular I Know two sons I get it like you know sometimes it takes a little bit to get off the couch you know there's something on Netflix it's fine this is not a thing that happens all the time you Catherine hard work will be discussing her film at the Fox and it is\nHow much her it's free I mean there is literally no excuse not to be at the Fox on Saturday Night\nThere is you're right and and you know even if let's just say let's just say maybe you're not a skateboarding fan and I understand that um there's other great programming it all the other venues so for example I'm where I'm calling you from the Scottish right for the third year in a row we're doing a vintage a silent movie black and white silent movie\nA whiz live musical accompaniment and so a lot of folks know of the great Jeff ... uh the piano player and a former you a teacher and jazz great\nAh he is going to for the third year a company a film this year it's Tom Mix is Nineteen twenty two films sky high which was filmed partially in the Grand Canyon so it's got a nice little Arizona connection and\nAnd Jeff is pounding away on a on a new score that he's written specifically for the film so he's going to be in her I worked in a little ... check at three o'clock so I'm super excited to see that but\nIf you've never seen a silent movie with live music I mean it's really transformative it's magical it's not that you know seven point one surrounded with speakers in the ceiling any of that stuff is is this is you know a live person playing along and responding to what's on the screen and it it's just it's magical it really is\nI one of my uh the highlights to me and it's it's a unique innocence sort of thing right I mean they're obviously a lot of events and things to do I would say the a critic versus audience\nEvent with critical horror film threat I if if you're a person who is passionate about film first of all Chris gory more passionate about it than you are and will be happy to tell you about it in the best possible way um\nYou know with a topic including movie critics are idiots or it should be should be exciting that said or one thirty tomorrow at these guys right purple room or how how did this happen how did you get how does why is ...\nChris is great so I had Chris up in Napa when I was when I was programming the Napa Valley folk festivals so we were also both members of the broadcast film critics which is kind of the the big film critic association so I I always run into Chris it awards ceremony these different things I say Chris I got to get you a Tucson and he was like absolutely so we\nBack in back in January we lined up and and we uh it's funny we didn't actually settle on on the panel of that we're going to be discussing until probably about two months ago we got on the phone for a while and said what\nDo we want to talk about what do we think is current and win what what's what's going to be fine and of course he was one of our jurors last night for desert pitch and I think everybody that didn't know him fell in love with him right then because he is just such a great he's he's the he's just as great movie geek that is just witty and has such a grand he founded film threat which of course is just this kind of great iconic\nA you know was was a magazine and it's all kinds of good stuff but it's just to have to have somebody like Chris in town and someone like Kathryn it's just really kind of puts us on the map in terms of you know\nYeah juice on his ... they were on the map and a good people want to come here and talk about it and you know they also appreciate our audience as I mean all my\nMy visiting filmmakers for the past three years of all that you know wow you've got great audiences these ... have been great asking questions we love how they turned up for things so I mean we're we're getting a reputation and continuing that a reputation of being a a film savvy town so let's let's keep it up to San\nIt does happen and so they were I think as far as I could tell brought in a series of Nichols in a bag\nThere was a crumpled up five dollar bill I'm not entirely sure if it was a whole five dollar bill or just ...\nMinutes and then uh the oh Halloran you can watch it on YouTube on their YouTube page you'll Halloran campaign brought the money back\nTo the Republican offices in Flagstaff a ... ... it's all a mess but yeah apparently the the communist that organization is not\nSeemingly not real you know our campaign is making the contention that it was actually people from the office for the Republican office in fact\n... ... ... always find everything is always happening in politics the\nWe don't have to actually talk about the issues as as they stand but he's insane or see on donations stunned is happening uh speaking well on a wildly different now and he was looking at some of the uh the find work in the green valley news um how how was the breathing down there well\nWell we're not that there's there's an issue so a free bad week for free poor ... background mining uh they put a solution on the mind tailings which which over\nA hover over a well today they do there hover over green valley and uh that's solutions supposed to keep the mine dust down and it apparently was diluted by rain and on Saturday there was a lot of wind and a lot of what looks like we're having a snowstorm\nAnd then it kicked up again yesterday with gusts of up to twenty five miles per hour this has gotten into lungs that's gotten into homes it's a a free port is missing the air or they're stepping up they are cleaning up there's a lot of cleaning up going on\nToday and uh it's one of those things that happens when you live close to a mind the last really bad one was four or five years ago and it was the circle mine\nWhich is just outside of a surreal and it's a it was a beautiful day people have their windows open and the gas came up and there was a big crack in the mind tailings and\nIt all ended up in in houses so\nAre they at that time flew in an expert from Seattle who handle all the clean up they handled the hum of all the costs for it and paid a couple of hefty fine so uh we're in that situation again it's a it's a tremendous mess the rain hopefully is is keeping things down today but uh\nYesterday was it was quite the show in in the air in green valley\nAnd I mean you know it's it's there is an element of while they're going to you know tamper down to the dust and the tailings and things like that I mean this is getting I saw some of the quotes of the interviews are happening in the in the Green Belt may you know the news is sort of getting in people's houses I mean it is you know yeah you're\n... you're rounding people with you know\nMaybe limited resources to clean these things or some\nYeah and and that's why free for it's going to step in there and we were taught to one person who free ports got a power wash outside of the house they are going to a professional clean the carpets all of the furniture and every everything inside the house\nThat's how bad it is but again this is such a small particles that if it gets into your lungs it's really really bad news so again they're stepping up\nAnd the ... the mind doesn't actually say this but the truth is that\nThe mine was here first than mine was here before green valley was and therefore you move in kind and knowing what the score is doesn't make it right doesn't really even make an understandable because it's simply shouldn't be happening but it does it does kind of give them one of these little advantages like eh you didn't have to live here so that\nThat feels like some ... no no not some\nNow they're not this week well uh I\nThought I mean you know obviously the ... there's a million races going on for governor all the way down I thought this was this was my possibly fun idea I wanted to say I have to ask her steam to guess what is that what's that under covered\nWell it's it's a little facetious undercover because people covering them but still what does that raise that you don't think people are necessarily paying enough attention to\nIt that's that's out there Joe Joe or what what's something that people maybe should pay more attention to\nYou know I think that there's a a really big race coming up and down the ten on the house side I think that Democrats are putting all of the resources into getting um the Republican who's in office right now out\nAnd there's just a lot of back and forth on that and so this is probably one of the only districts that I can think of locally in southern Arizona\nThis is probably one of the only districts that I can think of locally in southern Arizona that could flip where we're going to have a Republican or you know possibly voted out we'll see what happens in the coming weeks but\nIt's just something that's kind of flown under the radar I Know that there's a lot of back and forth um there was a recent article that Hank\nHuman sending our roads and so but you know generally speaking just tell people talking about the race and\nTen is Todd clots alter is is that is my district full disclosure I got a a a delightful moustache a flyer from Todd uh yesterday was promoting his moustache I think is the best I can understand it and and thought had what could be charitable he described as a\nControversial year I think I mean there was there for for most most state legislatures supplied largely under the radar taught had some not so much under the radar moments\nSo the assault weapon the Confederate flag or ... which one are we talking\nAbout I was going to leave the third off about that but yeah so he there was an incident where he had what was the Confederate flag one it was\nIt was on his computer as his background picture and that upset a lawmaker who complained about it and then we got all of us got to hear about it from there well\nThese these things do happen and who are the ones who are who is the Democratic opponent of the rings I should know because it's your race I Know I I used to I used to be involved in politics uh but I I I'm a political now so I just I just pick things off the bat\nAnd they and then by the way we can't leave that third one off the ticket [laughter] they could actually Madison thing speaks to integrity the man who was married who made a vow to a woman and is screwing around apparently on the side he says are allegedly actually followed\nThrough but he is on a website and he says his wife has a not a meeting his knees and a certain area this is this is a huge integrity issue and it's up to the voters of course to decide whether it's enough to dump them uh but but he says you know it's my sex life is private no it isn't\nNo it isn't when you have publicly made a vow to to a person and then you are doing this and what ... what an barest meant for her and a shame\nTo him and then he comes out with that type of response and and I think I think twice before pulling the lever in his favor\nAnd and so this was the one thing I and you did some reporting on this as well like where did how did how did that news come out even\nWhile we have a you know tools that the Daily Star that help us keep a tab on\nThe seven hundred races that recover and so um something went online that had all this information about Kleinfeld there it was anonymous they went to great lengths to hide who they were but you know he's been into a couple of high profile fight slavery with both\nDemocrats and Republicans and so you know there are a small group of ah robes gallery of people who could have done it\nAnd we went from there to the dark nets asking Madison and ... you know spends a good couple of hours verifying the information before Todd you know came clean it emitted that the information was that was true\nAnd and we should also point out that this is the season where people are throwing information that reporters all the time trying to get their opponents in trouble\nFor and some some of it as a write on a lot of it's complete bologna\nAnd the started exactly the right thing by checking it out and then going to Todd and asking him about it and so there's a lot of things you'd love to run with but you get into a lot of trouble because it's it's not accurate but trust me\nOr the campaign is vicious shifts\nThat run I mean I Will say as you know you you get into journalism at least you know because of a curiosity or you know and also the public service aspect of it maybe but uh that time period of getting those emails like ... and I I even at the weekly we got stuff that we couldn't verify or we can run with\nIf you enjoy like the soap opera aspect of this stuff this is a really spectacular season the catch is is these people are making decisions that affect all of our lives as well so it's it's such a weird balance of like\nA yes a lawmaker on actually Madison a and also lawmaker who decides our schools are run you know and you\nAnd you know people who claim that we have no standards in journalism should see the garbage that doesn't get into ... it's far more interesting but it's probably a certainly not verifiable and it's probably not accurate but if we were lesser people it would be in there because it would certainly sell newspapers but we would never do it because we do have standard\nSee there you go that's good that's always a plus Dan do you have a a favorite least favorite race or something\nLike a yeah they're all my least favorite [laughter] if I if I had to point\nTo one um we won't get into it but the corporation commission during\nThe primary was actually very very interesting because of a PS involvement and uh and and that type of stuff but uh it's it's much more boring now but it's certainly something to be a pay attention to particularly since the Rodney Glassman is in the running for the Republicans he's a former Tucson Democrat served on the\nThat is amazing I'm
