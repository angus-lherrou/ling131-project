very different strategies in urban and rural districts Dr Paul ... from the center for vision and values at ... college has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nTime looming Henry and welcome to American radio journal the constitution\nOf the United states can be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states\nAnd convention of states action is here to explain how a convention woodworking why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we talk about a convention of states it's probably a process that most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYou're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found an article five of the United States Constitution it was literally put there two days before the end of the convention at Seventy seven and it's put their this idea of the states get together and convention put there for the very purpose of pushing back\nYou gather and convention put there for the very purpose of pushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby two thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together colic invention get together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically the application we're pursuing right now which is already been passed in twelve states calls for physical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy\nAnd ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding that this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nIs a real reason is is needed is then you referred to structure we've broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing those structural reforms one great example is terminal is simply used to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for\nThirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate\nAnd so we didn't need term limits now we do need term was when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court the justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four\nThey didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally those things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where you go a minute by minute is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about\nWell I don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process or the other process we're proposing amendments and members have to be proposed by Congress so we're talking about is\nCongress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on in Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of him and so it would take two thirds of both houses to propose it try to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nOr they haven't even been able to balance the budget the lifestyle of decades let alone propose it so\nWe need this convention in states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark one concern that has raised the as we do have as I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern that a\nConvention of states could go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by our constitution how would you protect against that\nWell first of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly of anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states that sent them to states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate that comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds they can be stopped by their states and ultimately the founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything\nYou can do the math I run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find it amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified and even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to the critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nChurch so it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way there which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already and\nSo it takes thirty four to get into convention in convention it takes twenty six days to pass a proposed amendment out of convention important to remember when you're in a convention the only thing I can mention can do is propose amendments that people get all scared about getting into convention\nWas seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that is the largest\nFederal budget deficit in a single year since twenty ... well that's right the first time of the Obama administration ... band with reason magazine thanks for joining us on this edition of American radio journal like yesterday's Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and he's also a long time Republican congressional aide he worked with Senator Rob Portman of Ohio\nFor years and he also crafted the deficit reduction plan for the twenty twelve Romney's campaign so Brian has been thinking about and writing about and talking about budgets in budget deficit for a long time and we appreciate him stopping by the show Brian thanks for being here\nThank you the budget deficit for the year that ended on September thirtieth Brian seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that the largest twenty twelve break these numbers downpours what's driving that big deficit increase that we saw over the last twelve months\nInteresting thing about the deficit is that is rising during a time of economic prosperity what'd you do see in the last couple of years have gone from four hundred and thirty nine billion all the way to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion\nRise of the deficit and a half year is mostly to the tax cuts which cock about a hundred and sixty four billion dollars if you include the address\nAnd expecting the over they raise the spending half for defense and and I've just spending that was about a hundred and forty six billion those two policies that would have been closer to four hundred and fifty million they push it up to seven Seventy nine\nAs you said we don't usually see big jumps in the deficit during times of of relative peace and prosperity we are on course right now for a deficit will exceed a trillion dollars by the end of the current fiscal year the twenty Nineteen fiscal year\nSo this problem is not going away in fact it's only getting bigger compare what's happening right now for the federal budget so where we were saying in twenty can through twenty twelve\nYears where we were we had that deficit up around a trillion dollars even just over a trillion dollars how is it different now versus that\nWe've had the deficit at one point four trillion dollars which brought a lot of deficit hysteria around the country and a lot of concerns rocketry party\nThe differences there was one point four trillion dollar deficits temporary revolt a very refreshing and when the recession and went away the deficit down mostly by itself a Congress that a little bit of tax hikes a little bit of spending cuts the stimulus spending ended\nAnd it dropped by the difference now is that moving forward the deficit is primarily going to be the result of Social Security and Medicare Seventy four million retiring baby boomers and rising healthcare costs\nThat's temporary that's not going away as a matter of fact in ten years on direct current policy baseline but if current trends continue we're looking at a deficit of about two or three trillion if interest rates rise\nAnd about ... percent of that that will be from Social Security and Medicare\nSo you have a kind of a combination of factors working here you've got the short term factors the tax cuts\nThe spending hikes then you've got the long term factors those entitlement costs that you talked about\nWe're talking with Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and he's the author of a paper that is just out this week Bryan we should plug this is titled a comprehensive budget plan to emerge a debt crisis you can find that at the Manhattan Institute website Manhattan Institute dot org\nAnd Brian ... is the author of that piece that looks at a not so much\nThe deficit that we're facing today but really that the white scary numbers that we're going to be facing in five or ten years if\nPolicymakers in DC don't get serious about dealing with is Brian tell us a little bit about what that sort of physical sue now me that is that is coming for us in the next ten years if we don't sit up and look at this trillion dollar deficit and and do something about today\nThe numbers are staggering over the long term it's hard to put it in the works because it almost sounds like monopoly money when you say the national debt right now I was twenty trillion dollars over the next Thirty years Social Security and Medicare is a shortfall of one hundred trillion dollars\nIncluding interest over Thirty years but never start to even imagine so what it really means is that in order to pay out promised benefits for Social Security and Medicare we would have to double tax rates\nCorporate tax rates double your family's tax rates double the payroll tax you send to Washington would have to double shifts to pay for the programs we promise we're not even taking into account the Bernie Sanders for a trillion dollars agenda this is doubling taxes to pay for the better I mean\nThere are a lot of details are in the paper here Brian and uh I Would encourage our listeners to check out the longer version of this interview that we have running it reason dot com right now but that you can get all the details there you can read the paper invited everybody knew about the minute or so we have left you Brian what is the basic formula here to avoid this coming debt crisis in America could be facing in the next day the next decade or so\nWe need a Congress to actually come together on a grand plan mostly a title that spending but access to be on the table to plan to to avoid it quite this would have the policies take effect is twenty three\nAnd so in order to accomplish that we ought to get people to the sort of negotiating this\nWe ought to get people to stop so we might really going to address the program and probably they will do\nThey really really big problem it could mean a as Brian said it it could mean the doubling of all the taxes that you currently paid of the federal government just to pay the existing debt in the system as a big problem we're not going to solve it must be start talking about it so at least we've got people like Brian Reed all out there who are talking about uh Brian thanks for taking some time to be here on the show thank you\nAnd again that is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute former Republican policy wonk on the hill as well you can check out his paper on the coming decorations that Manhattan Institute dot org check out our coverage of the budget deficit and what needs to be done\nTo address and you can also find a longer interview with Brian at reason dot com for reason magazine ... will get you right back here next week on another edition of

rather shameless the Democrats in mouse or changing their political colors from districts a district in man to man and woman to women and even swapping genders and other ways in a terribly cynical or rather reprehensible manner\nConsider literal democratic socialist of America the essay candidates are being recruited and run by the Democratic party these are tried and true socialist and they're running a defeating traditional Democrats like the cost us ... Costa in my home area of western Pennsylvania I'm\nHere referring to local BSA members some early and Sarah number auto who are on their way to the state houses elected socialists actually formally elected Democrats the same is true in the national scale for the elected Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nLook out the Democrats changed their skins as they head out of the urban areas into more conservative districts look at the challengers to too conservative Republican congressman two men of genuine conservative principles Michaeleen Keith Rothfus those two are being challenged by Ron didn't Nikola and Conor Lamb\nThose races plus the DSM III races of lead and then him or auto show with political Panthers these Democrats are in twenty eight team\nCheckout Rhonda Nicholas profile

what's next Democrats resurrecting the corps of Jack Kennedy\nAnd yet I imagine this guy de ... who they are trying to run as a moderate or even a conservative or as a kind of guys guy is probably on fire for transgender bathrooms in partial birth abortion it's like rocky Marcy on awaiting a rainbow flak\nGo outside of western PA and you see this trend all over the nation speaking of waving a rainbow flag check out another ds a champion candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris who left wing or is there touting as potentially the first biracial algae Beatty cue person to win a seat in the U.S

willpower who lives in that Republican district marvels at how one could watch ad after advice Cheryl and never learned she's running as a Democrat\nSo the Democrats by guys like Nickelodeon Land to try to win conservative districts like those of Kelly in Ross\nAnd then on a dime they flip the switch runs socialist like Ocasio Cortez in summer Lee and Sarah ... they're super liberal city districts in between they nab candidates like Kerri Evelyn Harris in my ear Cheryl I asked the Democratic party have you know principals\nActually they do while the one overriding principal or I should say purpose to win and secure power and then above all they hope to achieve the added purpose of impeaching Donald Trump\nI was in the city of ...\n... name it's not far from the city of cooking if anyone of us from Canada you know where that is\nThe reason is a historic city is because that is repeated it'd be the place where the muscles Thomas actually arrived in India in eighty fifty two fifty three something like a lot of historical evidence many historic locations that he actually came there\nAnd I've got books and books and the words of material that I picked up there to show who referred to the apostles Thomas coming there but through some conversations they're my colleague myself and whoever took us there were taken into the inner sang them\nThen assign them as an older where it's a huge crank we like ... like a safe and a certain code and the key is needed\nTo unlock it then it closes and your step onto a platform as soon as I found a platform loud music Blair's all over the place that means somebody is approaching the rally and you walk up to the glass and the ... about them to not go size piece of bone inside the glass\nAnd people who take their touch the last ... put it on their heart about down and show that to you that they tell you is a piece of all the radio bone from the forearm of the apostles Thomas [noise]\nI said I got to get it [noise]\nShe said after his body was taken back to Rome in more recent times the ... center piece was I'd known and now it's here on big loss for us to\nLook and see and so on I Wonder if Thomas regrets having ever said unless I look and touch and feel myself I myself do not believe [noise]\nYou know the real when the very gospel that tells the story of Thomas ... these things are written\nThese things are written that you might know that you have the turn a life proposition of truth former enduring than visual and so they hold out and form to the visual\nAnd let me just say to more here the last Center for cultural molding there's no center left to mold culture\nIt moved from institutions institutions to institutions no one place most all of culture now maybe if any place does is the entertainment media which legitimize this things and how much of an ISIS taste so that'd be an all sit down and talk about the same show in the same idle the next day\nThat's the way it goes and the last one is the shifting power to a yellow world\nWe must come to terms with is the world of entertainment and the world of sports principally wants to latch onto the young minds there's a big industry in at the big bucks in his big money\nIn it young guys coming out at the age of Twenty one and twenty two can be signing ten million dollar contracts the buying power the emerging power the I don't trust power all of that comes along with it and so it's shifting power to a young world\nThese changes have taken place over the last century number one it is going to take unapologetic from us that is not just heard but it's also seen\nOn apologetic that is not merely heard about it is also seen if your life has not demonstrating what your propagating it'll all be something that stays in the rational is to extend this it'll never ever come down to the ... of the existential there's no way to actually tested\nThat apologetic that is not only heard but is also seen the visual living out of the Christian life\nIs imperative for the times in which we live if a person cannot see a conversion story they will question at all the days of that last question it\nAnd I think it is a very critical thing number two he does unapologetic that has not merely argued but there's also felt unapologetic that has not merely argued but it's also felt\nThe argument factor is critical but the federal factor is the tail end of that argument he must feel the gospel\nThat me give you two quick illustrations of this and looked at my final taught been sharing this the last couple of days because it's so fresh in my mind\nAnd it is this I'm writing another book and I just finished my first chapter in which I talked about who is Jesus Christ and I took it from his own words the son of man the son of God the son of David\nWords the son of man the son of God the son of David and all of that has built into how exactly those talks were meant to be seen in the day in which he communicated them but I Know everywhere I go that there's a real\nPassion to have on so to some things especially in the Islamic world the argument for the doctrine of the trinity\nWe try and try and try and they're always responding with how can this be how can this me now obviously there's a transcending reality here that is beyond the human mind but I was in Delhi writing that chapter and I remember very clearly I haven't been on my knees and I said lord\nGave me some kind of a handle on this so I can communicate it and some metaphorical way to the audience how do we give analogy for something like this\nSo I prayed and off guard and it may not be of any help too because any analogy any metaphor will always fall short just like any parable will always fall short and you cannot Bush every parable to its ultimate details\nBut I'm getting old money's going out the window looking out and just taught comes into my mind\nAt the moment of consternation when a husband and wife have gone she made to the love in that sacredness of act as marriage in that moment of conception takes place in the mother's womb\nIn an incredible way that mother bearing the child actually has three DNA is within\nHer at that time there is her DNA there is the husbands DNA and there is a new life that at that point is not even known to her\nIn if you got three persons in the prisons all of that

three becoming what\nThat tells me that ultimately argument will take you to all kinds of directions but what the world hunger score is a relationship\nAnd that relationship or wisdom parks feeling in to life and so when you're making arguments what other arguments you again remember ultimately\nWe are feeling entities we're thinking entities and so we go beyond the argument to the feeling and that's why it's so important to share the feelings of the questioner\nNot just the questions of the questioner Sean apologetic that is not just heard but seen not just argue but failed and lastly an approach that rescue is not only the\nFans to reach them for God but the means as well what is the means the means art ultimately to be the word of God to the Holy Spirit to God the moment you think

today's utopia of America's fabric in Studio where Charles Taylor as you're Carlos and Jeff which is the anchor continuing the discussion about federal is Seventy eight from a couple of weeks ago Jeff\nContinuing on with about the second half of federal is Seventy eight\nIt's really important to get into the nuts and bolts of what Hamilton's trying to say\nAnd so again remember the federalist papers were written to try to alleviate the concerns of the anti federalist in what they had against the constitution\nAnd part of what they had against the constitution was they thought\nThat the judicial powers we're going to be run away at some point in the history of our republic and boy were they write and we're going to learn that they did have some points but let's see what Hamilton says it's supposed to be what is happening\nWith our judiciary today Hamilton says a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the judges as the fundamental wall\nIt therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning as well as the meaning of any particular act\nProceeding from the legislative body\nIf there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that is between the legislative body and the meaning of the constitution that which has the superior obligation and validity or of course to be preferred or in other words the constitution\nOught to be preferred to the statute the intention of the people\nTo the intention of their agents so I think is really important to say that even if times change if laws passed that what is supposed to be given the greater weight is what the people have ratified and that is the constitution over what their representatives think they should be doing\nThe problem becomes over a period of time that the lens through which people and I'm not making an excuse for extra constitutionality of the lens through which people see those laws\nChanges and the focal length of it changes and the shape of the lens changes okay but how so given example the idea for instance and Casey versus Pennsylvania on which roe v Wade was based that somehow ... from the number of the constitution\nAuthorize abortion well there's a point to be made to government privacy should look into the womb but that also doesn't mean that the states can't regulate abortion until the Supreme Court stepped in and legislated that it could\nAnd there's an example of how the lens of liberty has a tendency to shift its focus and get out of focus\nOkay and I would say in in Hamilton's going to get into this and this federal is paper but also in subsequent ones to basically say yes there is something called precedent and we need to pay attention to what precedent means bought going back to the original document that should be the first and foremost way to get direction\nThe first and foremost precedent exactly where you may precedent based on principle then you're precedent is okay the problem is is that if the principal is viewed as shifting then the lens through which we interpret it will change even though the troop principle itself has not\nHamilton says nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power it only suppose is that the power of the people as superior to both and that where the will of the legislature\nDeclared end it statutes stands in opposition to that of the people declared in the constitution\nThe judges ought to be governed by the latter\nRather than the former now this came up in the Obamacare verdict when John Roberts wrote this in in effect in my opinion what he was doing was trying to make excuses for the legislature in in grasping at straws to figure out ways of how to make the legislative branch\nAnd the law they pass supersede the constitution and what a Hamilton uh saying right here\nYou really need to go to the constitution and not the legislative branch\nFurthermore what Roberts was doing which is you give government the assumption that it is correct in its interpretation of the law which makes a very steep surface to climb if you're trying to challenge it\nAbsolutely opposed to what Joseph Story sad the way we should interpret the constitution which is which is hadn't deference to the people and that if there is any type of arm wrestling going on for a fight goes to the people doesn't go to the government\nBut it hasn't since the Nineteen thirties about wicker versus Phil burn the Kansas weak case\nRight to Hamilton continues a few sentences down the rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relatives the liquidity is that the last in order of time Shelby preferred to the first you know the more current the precedent\nThe more validity it has but there's a danger in that so he continues again is they teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority\nAnd that accordingly whenever a particular statute contravene the constitution it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the ladder\nAnd disregard the former the constitution supersedes any law that is unconstitutional\nFor those people who are argued\nThat ... versus Madison was the first time that the Supreme Court had contemplated or thought about judicial review they're absolutely wrong I mean here it is in the federalist papers talking about what I had judicial role list but it wants to limit what they have the power to review judicial late so we continue\nIt can be of no way to say that the courts on the pretense of a Republican seat may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature or the words a judge can't put his own opinion in place of the constitution\nSo in effect he's saying that we need to have lifetime appointments there's great precedent for this and if I had to just say if there's one federal is to read to really get the nuts and bolts of the judicial branch it would be Seventy eight\nContinuing on and federal is number Seventy nine and this is talking about the position of the judiciary also written by Hamilton\nWhat he's saying is there a lifetime appointments but this is how we get rid of them if we have to if they're bad the precautions for their responsibility are comprised and the article respecting impeachments\nThey are liable to be impeached for mouth conduct by the house of representatives and tried by the Senate and if convicted may be dismissed from office in disqualified from holding any other\nThis is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessity of independence of the judicial character and is the only one which we find in our own constitution and respect to our own judges in other words he's saying you got one pathway to get rid of these people\nAbsolutely but they expected the government to use it and we know that it has never happened at the Supreme Court level\nOne Supreme Court justice was was he he but he was not it was that convicted\nThe only federal judges I said two weeks ago that was impeached and convicted and removed\nWas Alcee Hastings from Florida and I believe in Ninety One or Ninety two he then turn around and ran for Congress and it's been seated as a congressman ever since after being removed from the bench for federal bribery and corruption isn't that wonderful well that's why I call him out of reprehensible [laughter]\nWe move along to federal is number ... jurisdiction of the federal courts is what Hamilton wants to talk about\nBecause again the anti fertile is we're worried about a Supreme Court usurping all the powers of the state courts and being able to run roughshod over them in in federal is Seventy eight Hamilton's basically explaining\nThat no the Supreme Court has only going to have jurisdiction according to article three and these original cases and that the state courts will\nSay original cases you mean like a rising between two states yes in anything that has given original jurisdiction ... which is very ... which is kind of rare that are in our laws\nAnd that the states courts will still be Supreme in their own realm of sovereignty and their own jurisdiction so it seems scarcely to admit of controversy that the judiciary authority of the union ought to extend to the several descriptions of cases\nFirst of all those which arise out of the laws of the United states passed in pursuing up there just in constitutional powers hours of legislation of legislation that can\nDo all those which concern the execution of the provisions expressly contained in the articles of union third to all those in which the United states or a party for to all those which involve the piece of the confederacy\nNoticed what they call that confederacy whether they relate to the intercourse between the United states in foreign nations or to that between the states themselves death\nTo all those which originate on the high seas and our of admiral tea or maritime jurisdiction and lastly to all those in which the state tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial and unbiased\nSo he lays out the jurisdiction of the court right Hamilton continues the mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws decides to question and he's talking about deciding the question of how can we have thirty\nAnd he's talking about deciding the question of how can we have Thirteen different Supreme Court you've got to have a Supreme Court and he continues Thirteen to independent courts\nFinal jurisdiction over the same causes arising upon the same laws is hydrate and government from which nothing but contradiction in confusion can proceed\nBut we seem to have that even now in some of our lower federal courts that gives them the power to throw a monkey wrench is into some of the government operations without really having the blessing or paying attention to precedent that even the Supreme Court except for\nThe problem there are those the court below at some government\nWe've allowed government to become far far far too fat with bureaucracies and with constituencies that have their own power centers and one feeds the other because the more you can give away of somebody else's money the more power you can accumulate he goes on to say it is to comprehend quote\nAll cases and law an equity arising under the constitution the laws of the United states and treaties made or which Shelby made under their authority\nTo all cases affecting ambassadors other public ministers and counsels to all causes of admiral team and maritime jurisdiction to controversies to which the United states she'll be a party to controversies between two or more states between the state and citizens of another state between citizens have a different state between citizens of the same state\nClaiming lands and grants of different states and between the state and the citizens they're up and foreign states citizens in subjects unquote this constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the union\nYes that is the entire judicial authority to just sticks it defines jurisdiction basically remember what he's trying to do here he is trying to alleviate the concerns that the anti federalist had their states meaning day their states are going to become subject\nTo a tyrannical power of the Supreme Court\nTelling them how to live what they can do going over\nTheir delegated authority that the constitution is supposed to keep them bound with and that's exactly what's happened today so they did have some some points in the last paragraph of federalist eighty Hamilton writes if some partial inconveniences should appear to be connected with the incorporation of any of them into the plan\nIt ought to be wrecked collected that the national legislature will have an apple authority to make such exceptions\nAnd to prescribe such regulations as we'll be calculated to I'll be eight or remove the inconveniences\nSo he continues to try to alleviate it concerns the anti federal rehab heating the legislative branch has more power than judicial\nRight because it it can limit the jurisdiction of the things I Would rather than what is\nOriginal jurisdiction in the constitution itself except the problem with that is is where are you going to find legislators that has a stickler for to to to do that in my well we haven't found it well then we will never will not under conditions as we have today\nWhere people are worried about what other people think of him no more concerned with their bless a Twitter feed and why people think about them than they are about following the constitution the technical term for this was a rectal cranial inversion\n[laughter] so I Want to end\nOn federal is eighty one were Hamilton is trying to alleviate\nThe concerns of the anti federal is and so he is actually quoting the anti federalist here on what their concerns are so what I'm about to read is the anti federalist worries about the Supreme Court so here's the anti federal is what he's quoting\nThe authority of the proposed Supreme Court or the United states which is to be a separate an independent body will be superior to that of the legislature\nThe power of constructing the laws according to the spirit of the constitution will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think proper especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the vision or correction of the legislative body\nThis is as unprecedented as it is dangerous in Britain the judicial power in the last resort resides in the house of lords which is a branch of the legislature in this part of the British Government has been imitated in the state constitutions in general\nThe parliament of Great Britain and the legislatures of the several states can at any time rectify by law the exceptional decisions of their respective courts\nBut the errors and usurpations of the Supreme Court of the United states will be uncontrollable and remedy lists were they ... they had some points now he continues he says this upon examination will be found to be made up altogether a false reasoning\nIn this conceived fat but we do know with hindsight that the anti federalist had some points here\nAnd that we need to go back and read the federalist papers to understand what Hamilton's arguments were and where the founders thought the judiciary should stay in their lane in what the anti federal Hussein worth the dangers and we are today seeing those dangers manifest\nI don't know I don't think it's always a bad thing to take a page from Aaron Burr's doctor that fast but on that note that's all the time we have for Joe
