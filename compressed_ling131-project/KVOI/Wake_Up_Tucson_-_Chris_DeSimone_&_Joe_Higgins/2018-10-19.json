know\nWhen we did when you were here when it was already a mess of bird talk with Ben ... as I was when you're betting on the hills all there's lots of birds around were hanging out with a remote though he is the master master gardener a and grounds at the\nAt the west fabulous westward look resort and uh we were just talking about how he is a will definitely be there at the beginning of the dug in Mary\nUp parties though if you want to introduce you guys and then he might be able to give you a little a little love and the little a little guidance on what's going on Libya or green our our Cora feel\nFriends at the at the westward look uh\nSo what's a ... one less thing before I get on the general garden talk with you one of the things I Love that we saw at your place was your butterfly garden yes because it's actually one of those real ones because some of these other gardens they kind of trapped the who's the than the butterflies inside but you're planting the correct thing\nIt's not even realize it until we're sitting they have this patio area and that has all these these these different kinds of shrubs and flowers around it\nAnd then until I didn't even know it until you walked near the bushes that literally a hundred butterflies come flying around and it was like it was like something that an avatar for God's sakes\nWhat lovely place to be at now not only because they work there but especially the gardens just brings lots of diversity I have seen owls hawks I'm so much\nTalking about birds as well a lot of activity over there in fact that's of bird groups they go to ... they come back and they see the diversity did that we have they go it should be this nation for Britain right um I usually say well\nWe can kind of news and we can ... you can help us for the word\nNow um what is something that people right now in their gardens could plant over a year to get more butterflies what what what's something that attracts butterflies in their gardens\nWhether it'd be used in is a lot of a ... okay I got him ... yes very easy I'm\nAlone with that uh I Do have some of the ... the flowers called or aged redone\nIt should rein him for some reason I check some provides a lot of Nick thing for them along with that I Do have to use a wider future if you noticed we do have a what they found and whether it's a small lead or running stream throughout\nThat makes a big difference they or tonight you have to provide that because butterflies they um they usually get the nutrients from from a a dump area where the soils quit okay that's that's do you have to provide that to them\nAll right so if you do a combination of land Santa these missed flowers in some sort of water feature\nA loan with uh some of the ah what is known as a um butterfly plant material available um anytime you go to a nursery asked\nUm what do you have\nTo attract butterflies okay ask clips his his one of them is a ... it's called butterfly Bush\nUm it's funny because I had to be real flowers exact game yellow or red yeah yes but I'm Talking to one of the guests says that he or she planted a lot of uh\nUm butterfly plants in Seventy so a lot of worms eating the leaf so he decided just to kill them all let's not question\nSo I'm Glad you're acting all these butterflies and I am in my little little area but how about bees doesn't like they do also a track these not know that\nYou will see some but not not really a lot to say is we should take over that and so anytime what's fascinating\nAnd the nature walks that we do we take our guests to these areas and they go wow how can a buddy told me about this um so it's it's really unique destination\nWere hanging out with or a moon do at the west would look he's the master of the gardens up there or the cave Eli at ten thirty clock says seven twenty four in the morning just so you know getting to work this morning a rambling do right now people at home or in the middle of October right\nWe're not a well what what do we like fifty sixty days to maybe a freeze exactly uh what what what should they be planting right now if anything\nYou can still do more and more tomato soup view like tomatoes or a pet perceive you like it's going to give us another ground okay so it's perfect timing yet although now they suspect and expected with weather but\nYou can you can be if you put if you put them in containers you may be able to put them in to to us or to their houses so they will be a much better micro climate there\nOkay because that's the big thing right now is that we say now what is there anything we should be planting now that will do its thing in the spring kinda thing what's a what's a couple of those things\nYes a long time it would be better off in the ground or most of the planes too much better um planted in the ground that being exposed to nursery we'd be better at home as long as you provide water to it um some work on the matter and\nSo by the time spring get scared the roots are well established and they're stuck for this in a ... a more growth in and flowers\nAwesome or what's in the future for you guys are in relation to I Know first of all you guys are doing a lot of really nice uh renovation I saw on some of the room buildings you know new air conditioners new you guys are doing you're investing a lot of money to make this place even better\nYes um we're

Oh yes we do and uh we would um then they would come over they would take custody of Christie's them all and that was that\nBy the required that they come over to the jail as opposed to already be there right it was a convenience issue and it was just convenient for them to be there\nAnd ah so we're just going to go back to the way we used to do business which was working it was a workable solution but this became such a bone of contention in the community some segments of the community and I didn't want to just the opposite in it and say okay I'm not going to compromise I'm not going to do anything and then I Do for a fact I Would not get much results\nAnd start funding will good out of the problem is there's a lot more money coming from the federal government down to the states isn't it down to the sheriff's and I have to be able to accept that money and I can't unilaterally do it\nThe ah so you are of you who to I guess the question is who does mark Napier actually report to\nYou right\nSo that's what I'm saying is how can I get I Know you you're trying to do this the class the correct way with this money is there any options for you to ever figure out how can things be modified for the sheriff's department to receive this without getting the blessing of these three folks\nUm behind the scenes of working on a lot of different things or could be a legislative solution to this that says for example that went to public safety granted presented to assure\nThat does not require any further appropriation meeting I don't have to go to the board asked for your body that the sheriff on behalf of the county could execute said grant that legislation doesn't exist yet\nUm there are other things we can do a the deployment of the resources the Pima County sheriff's department are completely under my purview um we can and we're actually planning\nTo do a rural Pima County safety initiate that will look a lot like stone guard unfortunately the taxpayers of Pima County will be paid for that because the orders supervisors as not allowing the federal funds I Need to keep our ... our county safe\nWhich is really just a political decision it and um [noise] the anger should be directed the board of supervisors for for politicizing a grant that was accepted for twelve years on the consent agenda\nUm and and the practices of how we implement that grant what we're doing with that grant have not changed\nThey've politicized is and that's where the anger should be directed I'm simply trying to find a way to make it work and um [noise] and that's really all I can do and tell you the legislation changes or something changes that allows me to get all adults accept these funds I have to find a way to work with the board tried to make that happen\n[noise] ah because for a mobster that I'm not the president I Can't do this by executive order I Can't I don't I don't have that\nPresident I Can't do this by executive order I Can't I don't I don't eat all I have that authority unfortunately but um\nOur money is stuck and now we've got about two million dollars that I think the government is going to approve us to get I don't want the people of Pima County to miss out on a low spots\nSo one last question before I let you go I'm One of the things I keep hearing as in you know be excused I've heard this from supervisor volunteer as ... times right\nIs the idea that by accepting this money there is a dynamic that exists that someone who is I'm Mexican American\nMaybe legally here and\nYou know or whatever won't call up the Pima County sheriff because you're going to knock on him to the feds and they're going to get kicked back to Mexico so it will be quote more unsafe which I was asked asinine but I'd like you to explain to people why that's totally untrue\nWell we actually looked at the calls I'm rich unity for people of Hispanic origin over the last ten years it has remained incredibly constant at about twenty five percent which beers a community demographics\nSo that argument while politically it sounds really good it's an interesting sound bite is not supported by the data at all not at all\nUm we still get about twenty five percent of our calls for service for people of Hispanic origin there's no chilling effect on people calling the sheriff's department\nIn fact we have a policy that says that unless there's some reason to um ask a crime victim of their immigration status we don't do it right\nSo it's a it's a need argument\nI understand how the activist a play that argument out but there is absolutely no basis in fact that we can find just or not\nAnd what can listeners who are hearing us right now who support you as the sheriff they voted for you a couple of years ago what can they do to help you\nI'm just continue to apply appropriate pressured the board of supervisors to accept stoned garden funding as we have for twelve years and trust the brave men and women in the county sheriff's department\nTo do what they've been doing for the last twelve years just go out engages stole garden operations in a constitutionally appropriate manner to keep the mechanic six that's all I've tried to do for us it's it's really a simple transaction to me\nThis is about public safety not about politics I Need that still gardens funding because a lot more money coming from the federal government state the sheriffs\nTo keep this county safe there's hundreds of thousands of dollars of the money there\nAre well over a billion dollars in overtime to deny the fact that our county is impacted by transnational crime threats coming up from the border is silly and disingenuous we know there's a a drug trafficking problem human trafficking problem sex trafficking\nAll forms of transnational threats that migrate in door county I Need a supplementary funding in order to combat those threats\nAnd to work with our federal partners to keep a state that's also allows us to do that divorce supervisors need to put this back on the consent agenda trust the sheriff and the people at the sheriff's department to go out and do what we've been do still garden for more than a decade and um let's move this out of politics into public safety and move forward\nMark thanks for calling as always thanks for your service in the entire crew at the Pima County sheriff department keep doing what you're doing guy\nWell it's it's tough wrote the homeland um do you like a yacht every day you get it from a different direction\nI Am simply trying to do what I Believe in the best interest of the whole of the county and I understand how people are concerned about this but we absolutely have to move forward on this we we've got to have that still got funded and we've got to get back on the Senate you had to work laws\nAre rights or have a good weekend and we'll see you next week make you aware that there is a measure of mark Napier Pima County sheriff Yes sir\nThey are just to the they're just tying the man's hand he's probably trying to do public safety\nAnd so the first thing wake up with news no okay well you need to tell all your friends this weekend to so whenever they talk about this story and you see it in the paper in this star the sentinel or who the heck is that is in print or you see it on TV with the talking heads and they say\nThe uh the board of supervisors know if the Democrats majority of the board of supervisors who voted against this and continues to vote against Iraq ... never ever said that and they never will because they don't care\nThat would be like facts and it's like it's like the sheriff said data what what would supervisor ballet dancer whenever care about data you only cares about you know\nFeelings and and if you get the cat in the back and the the ... the ice and all that stuff it's just it's just\nPlain bull meanwhile like the sheriff says all these people are coming across the border sex traffickers drug traffickers yeah ... million dollars this week cocaine we read the stories that happens\nHow the heck is he supposed to take care of you and your kids coming out the out of school in the county or when he's when he's supposed to be down there taking care of\nIt's impossible and his hands are tied by the Democrat majority of the Pima County board of supervisors", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson -
