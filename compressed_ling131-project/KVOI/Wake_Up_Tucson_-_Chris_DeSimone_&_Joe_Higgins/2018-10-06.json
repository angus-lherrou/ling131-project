V. O. Y. two sons boys [noise]\n[noise]\nWalking back it is the Buckmaster show our friday edition we are talking with Afghan Rodrigues Pima County recorder that found you were first elected does it Nineteen Ninety two\nYes that is true that I thought that was right so we're coming up are pushing toward almost Thirty years\nOr in this job uh tell me about the uh early balloting and you had said there were did I hear you say there were a twenty five thousand new folks are registering is that what I heard you say\nYes but I said there was twenty five thousand new citizens register between the the voter registration cut off in the primary election until last week when we upload every Monday I'm so all work he came and we keep change you know updating information going through our process as we normally do [noise]\nUm what I said is a currently we have about five hundred and forty five thousand register voters in Pima County and growing\nAnd our first flowed out of balance that will be dropped in the mail on Wednesday the and the first day we can legally mail ballots is about three hundred and Ninety thousand balance we mail that\nVoters they'll they should be looking for a green envelope um make sure you read the directions follow 'em don't use felt hands that they believe through a on the ballot\nOr one of the other tip questions and then they get the balance is they say do I have to vote for every single race and the answer is no you don't you just vote for the races or the issues that you feel comfortable and knowledge\nDylan um I I I Know that\nAnd we're trying to do that or certainly in news stories they get to push the voter registration deadline is Tuesday that's not necessarily the deadline to ask for an early ballot though right\nOh no the deadline to requests normally valid is on the go get my election calendar you a death\nOr something like the nineteenth or something like that or even later\nI'm In is hold on one second\nIs it's October twenty six no even look at it is the last\nYou can go online and on my officer recorded that he ... up and do request on line or they can simply collar office I'm at seven to four or three three zero\nA lot of times people call us because they'll be temporarily away either I'm visiting their parents or a relative or travelling or whatever and they'll tell us when they want us to mail the ballot to um will badly mail the ballot\nThe other misconception is that people will have their mail forwarded and think their male will be forward in a lecture material is not for all it'll be kicked back to us [noise] um and\nOn for a double it'll be kickback to us I'm and I'm so we kind of have to start begin chasing of these voters are in and telling them to the ballot was returned to us and where do they want us to send their ballot test to them wherever they are temporary yeah\nSo one thing that a couple of friends move would lose the question's kind of it the you know to help them out or whoever else is in the situation if you're registered to vote for closing Pima County\nWould you move after the voter registration deadline before the election do\nWhat we should you go boat hoping to go through both should you\nDo a cast it in the precinct you were registered in you know you can't change it can you\nYes we can keep doing them and that's what creates the provisional ballots on election day if people didn't update their address and they don't know where to go do we keep telling them yes they can keep updating their addresses or um or go to one of our early voting site we have eleven early voting sites um opened up\nOur three main recorders offices will open up on the tenth\nAnd then we've expanded it to 'em locations throughout the valley\nUm they just have to go again to my um website and look under early voting locations and it'll give you the names and uh uh the the addresses and the times that we're open\nWe have a location green valley solder eat the area we have north side the last week a before election where we we stop 'em\nMailing out ballots we've opened up for additional site\nMost of them have been cooperation with the public libraries are so that people we can deviate and one is the mission library\nMission and I hope the Miller golf links library that Kirk beer library and Pima County natural resources or so and we're also um I was the first quarter in this state that actually opened up early voting side of the university University of Arizona campus\nSo that some hubbub for it's like a mini city um and so we have several locations out there and people can just look and we try to take care of those type of situations\nSo they don't create a provisional ballot on election day we we divert those people to one of our early voting sites prior to election\nDay as long as somebody's on the list by midnight on to do if you're living in Tucson you moved to Miranda at the end of the month you can still end up costing about in the place that you end up living correct because we didn't have to\nTell you it but we like to defeat deviate those people to an early voting sites that they don't get stuck in a line of you in location and that type of situation\nRight I Want a little bit of perspective here uh how has early voting really changed everything and by election day what percentage of registered voters probably already cast their ballot them Rodriguez\nWell it depends on the election but overall in in the actual amount of people that actually cast a ballot whether it's at an early voting side or by mail versus a polling location\n... it's about Seventy to Seventy five percent of the people who are actually voting or voting by either mail at our early voting site they're not even going to pull in location anymore\nSo that that's\nThe wave and this is across the state of Arizona there are a few exceptions to a few counties\nWhich is probably Apache a Navajo county I'm there like a traditionalist they want to go to their polling location and and vote that way so um most people like I said are using the early voting process as to how to cast their ballot now\nAnd if someone was looking for a little extra money do do you still are you still hiring people to work at the polls\nWell that would be the department elections I Can't answer that question because they're already going through some training to a\nTraining process like my office we finished hiring everyone because today we're training a well trained Monday different tasks like today today we're we're\nWorking with our early voting site people\nUh we're training though there's about fifty people at that will be at these various locations were training them today a Monday we start with the problem ballot teams and then Wednesday you start with opening up our sights and dealing with those people that were we call the processors\nI did hear a little something that the Senate isn't taking the weekend of this where there were busy this weekend is something going on and so this just doesn't seem like the the the right we can to\nBe had no I mean if I Would ... votes and some are on Kavanaugh in DC is something you can phone in if Jeff Flake is flying in the wrong direction\nIt could be newsworthy and you can't vote a ... at the U.S Senate ... can you have to be there on the floor yeah wow in person no proxies but he has said he's going to vote for cabinet has any\nWell he voted for closure today so we don't know what happens next I mean you know today was about moving the vote for him beginning debate\nI think there are some people that are holding their cards the vast and Jeff has really been great at keeping us all on this idea of our seats trying to figure out what is going to do next\nAnd he hasn't really said one way or another this week whether he's a a thumbs up thumbs down\nFor the given quotes that suggests both yeah at different times yeah\nWell he did say I believe the latest was that he would vote to confirm a judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court quote unless something big changes\nAlthough he said that before the report that not correct yeah so and there's a lot of what he makes of what's in that report and of course what he makes of the political pressures he's getting and what people are ah telling him you know talking to him about\nAnd one of the undecided was supposed to let us know I Believe that she was going to let everybody know this afternoon whether or not a ... that was Susan Collins and re I don't see anything ... of the latest on that I don't think she has\nNo nothing nothing yet on that a lot of talk or some of this polling that's been coming out uh Joe Fergus and one of the polls showing in the governor's race there are three vote\nThere at three different calls out right now that put\nDavid Garcia behind governor Doug Ducey and while what Paul can be bad or two polls can be bad we're getting into the numbers where you know you're seeing not just a bad Paul you're seeing some trends so I think David Garcia's got some numbers to make up at the multiple ways still but\nYou know it doesn't look great right now\nIt's not outside the realm of possibility quite yet but uh the the new trend has not been looking great for the challenger and ready to leave that up on my screen there that the the polling showing voice that spread is not\nReal positive for for a for a\nDoctor Garcia some of those numbers look like one poll I had like a do see out by Eighteen\nPercentage points but then again there's another one that is as close as four so I'm Still leaning very much induces direction how about the U.S Senate race that's very ah certainly don't they say within the margin of error\nFor the most part although polls I've seen him do please correct me if I'm wrong but I mean you get one part says send them as the head the next day you get a call the ... the head and it goes back and forth there are just a number of polls out right now that just essentially bring it down to flip a coin\nYeah then that most of those goals are the the the point spread between the mix ... that's been within the margin of error of each one of those pools of\nBasically they're saying ...\nWe had a and Kirkpatrick on the program yesterday and uh we do have Leah Marquez Peterson scheduled to be on the program next Thursday or how is that race going right now a gentleman\nUgly when it's Joe says it's ugly ugly for um for Leah or what\nI think that there's back and forth going on there's now groups that have gotten into the race and put money out we see fliers attacking both sides on this I'm sure ads are just around the corner I'm I have heard whispers that the teacher will see us going to pull back on the amount of funding\nThey're going to put behind and Patrick and that could mean two things either they're very confident of their chances and see to or the money has to go somewhere else 'cause needed some room\n... and if it if you look over all the money picture you know I I hate to every time we look at a race just go straight to\nIs that every time we look at a race just go straight to looking at the books in that way but\nIt it it it tells you something that this time around the amount of money that's been raised by the candidates in that race is nowhere near what we've seen in the past several election cycles where we've seen multi millions a pour it into the city too and we're just not seeing that this time around but did the equation\nIs is that Martha's missing from the component to she was a ... hundreds or for as long as she's been running in these races I noticed the Democrats poured in money on the other side right us because\nAnd so this time it's not a cheap all action by any measure but it just doesn't have that component because she's apps and we're\nSpeaking of absent uh your colleague our friend Tim stellar as an interesting column in today's Arizona Daily Star about a Senator Jon Kyl who's kind of been I guess under the radar would be kind of a\nThere's a there's a finally said something there was a protest that James ... office today the other is why there isn't one ... office today is because they're really winded right\n[laughter] so uh so he is a the caretaker he could take are of the seat and may I think he's a seat warmer for ... some people are concerned because there's not a lot of confidence that he's going to be here in January ... somebody else will\nBe appointed that that seems to be what everybody's thinking whether that pans out that way will have to see that\nThat's where all all the signs point to him being a you know some put somebody a temporarily put back into the Senate to pretty much specifically deal with the cabinet vote agree that the Republicans were a vote shy\nKen Bennett a has looking for his campaign his public campaign fund that's that's kind of um he says he's out of money you need some money badly\nThat says this isn't unusual we've always seen campaigns that have bills at the end of a cycle and even after they didn't win they'll reach out to supporters and ask for money\nTo help you know close accounts to help pay off consultant things of that nature of ... you know campaign running out of money is nothing new\nIf he's trying to get his cleaned elections funds which he\nThinks he qualified for and a lot of government officials say he did not qualify for so he's angling to get a more of the contributions that were made a added to the qualifying list\nAnd I think you he loaned him his campaign he himself wounded campaign a pretty tidy a chunk of money and he's looking to get that paid back\nRay is she a re Allen's kind of monitoring senator Collins right now are on the floor and making a quite a long speech a and I guess show make her announcement at the conclusion of that speech is that what you're so right now it's just\nBack and forth the building just this building the suspense was soon as we know here if it happens during ah during a the next couple of minutes we'll certainly uh let everybody know\nUh you know just I I had no idea this is away from politics Dylan but it's kind of\nThe situation with all that\nThe rain or I mean there were ... areas of the to hunter or a nation that had seven inches of rain from the remnants of Rosa\n... western Arizona got hit a whole lot harder than we did here in the Tucson\nMetro and I had no idea that that they had some of these um earthen dams on the nation that some of them are like over a hundred years old\nAnd you kind of think like uh maybe it's time or the bureau of Indian affairs or the government maybe takes a look at this situation\nThat kind of thing where you know sort of what he wants to spend any money on it because it's out of sight outta mind are quite frequently and unfortunately and ah we did to have\nThe the risk of one of those names are being overtopped with so much rain and if that happens a basically starts being washed away in the ... the entire damn can fail\nYeah I mean uh the thing is I say goes back a hundred years and um there's the people that were living downstream of this I could have been a really horrible situation can see\nHow dramatic it was I think it was my Christy from the star who took a really great aerial photo of I'm really crowded\nPaper for spending the time and the resources to really get that shot from above because just one shot from Mike Christie's photographs and you understand how they and how men that problem really is he\nNow but I just thought certainly
