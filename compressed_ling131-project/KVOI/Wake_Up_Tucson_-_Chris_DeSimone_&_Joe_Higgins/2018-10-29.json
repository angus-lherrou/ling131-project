S. T. while they found out that no that wasn't happening so then they started opening up a everything these are good schools I'm not saying that they're not doing anything\nBut to us the should not be running them at a loss that such as what we've been we continue to lose students ...\n... if you guys will mean you're running a daycare for us the employees right mhm and to us the bona fide to you as the parents or grandparents okay and your charging just enough\nTo make it revenue neutral direct I I'm not even saying make Adele I'm just making retinue neutral well I ... I could have that discussion but now let me ask you a question when did these things start\nThey started under a a mess gr harvest tenure with bringing in a he who shall not be named\nOkay so under the apes T I can say he can't eight Steve Sanchez reign of terror okay it's Halloween week what the hell right the reign of terror of H. T. and then so that is crystal foster ... threat All right so they started the things that sounded like a nice idea right we're having trouble attracting and retaining teachers\nWell actually he was bringing it on as part of what the U. S. P. was saying about retaining are teachers and getting other teachers okay so he was utilizing the premise of the u._s. be at the time\nAnd but what's happened is classic to us the first of all misread the situation right the teachers really weren't using it that much\nSo then we decided we're just going to open it up to the world\nSo now everyone in their mother who's paying attention to go to this place with their kid through and I'm sure if there's one place that's not too tough about collecting fees that he was the because you're the the ... district with the heart\nSo I assume if I'm an eight hundred dollars behind on my daycare fees it's not like to us these you know sending Gino in Rocco to help me find my checkbook\nAlthough we charge ban students I think it was Thirteen to Fifteen hundred dollars to be in bad yeah\nRight so again I've always said the deal is the deal with the is two things write to us the is a a jobs program for buddies yes especially if they need to make six figures and work at ten ten alright and\nWhy do you eat not just the ten ten but at our schools right remember we have principals who are related to\nOh that's true individual but at the same time then it's one big social experiment and this fits in perfectly with the idea that we're going to provide free daycare for the city of Tucson direct so how much is this cost the taxpayers of the city of who's on I ...\nI Believe that was at the range of almost a half million dollars last year if I'm if I'm correct I may be off a little bit but it continues\nSo the current number was one point for is what I saw most recently\nA that could be\nAll right so but what we're saying is where they just get big ... ... if there's one place that cannot afford a one point one point four million dollar loss on a daycare for everybody that you guys\nAnd and you know I I get beat up on individuals all the time on regarding this and it's like\nLike it or not we continue to the students we need to bring more students in here not in the students because my understanding as we're not getting as many people coming from the early learning learning or an infant in early learning centers\nInto the district but\nStudents equate the funding more he's losing students we keep losing funding we can't afford\nHere's the other thing right I'd be interested in seeing that because we know that parents are just running like crazy away from the listing All right they're taking them to charters privates open rolling okay\nAt the same time what would be interesting is or how many kids are graduating in a year now are out of the system right what's the what's the amount of kids actually at the parents are going to enroll my kid on the list they\nYeah like I like to see what that number is too that's another place where you're losing for somebody ... ... a graduate you have how many replacing a kindergarten right\nThe ... a graduate you have how many replacing a kindergarten right that'd be kind of a fascinating number to know\nI don't think we'd even had the ability to do that\nSeven nine zero twenty for the phone number let's go to Dr Kevin ... Kevin what's going on buddy\nGet on and off first of all I'm not at all like to thank you uh I called in to say I do like Michael ... Michael effects on that board\nI think he he does care about your son does care about the kids to the signs say redesign job Tucson and you know the culture has to change that so\nUh I've already voted voted so Michael you got one vote we appreciate you a it's a tough position but your diet and we need more Michael ... district one because we need a strong district of it\nIt's it's ... it's not as our ship so that's really oh\nWell thank you very much served at and again you know you're you're providing a a a service that gene us these not providing and as you and I've had discussions before you know it's my it's my job to put you out of business\nAnd you you you thanked me for that but I I'm Still trying to do the best I can and I appreciate what you do for the kids and what are they a huge a new building you have out there by my house\n[laughter] wait but their choice mine [laughter] if I go to the door you know\nWe have we have a you know for each school but we wouldn't run schools if we could get that sold for itself so anyway I look back at you and you\nAnd uh you know you can be a street fighter street fighter listener so God Bless you you do your\nPriest shade everything you do also thank you sir\nThink about all the time and have a good day that's what makes up for any cause he keeps leading with his chin and getting a lot well do I\nUm [noise] so three votes this is what it takes ... votes to get actual substantial things done here trip um it'd be better\nFor five but I did I have managed to get five votes by the way\nWhat's at the end the ... uh yeah [laughter]\nI got I got I don't know a a doctor Trujillo I brought in with five votes everyone voted for him\nSo Dr Trujillo and I like I like gave a lot okay um when you see like the fight it's a war All right what are we talking about here is it did they talk about the the the amount of monitors seemed to be less and you can't stop every fight that's just life okay so I don't want to be overly\nOn your guys is case about that but you know is there to the proper amount of adults per kid and some of these schools are because of budget cuts in because the enrollments dropping so fast over the years it just tough to kind of you know match that up\nI think that we need to have more monitors there who will actually do something in step in and pull off\nA fight before it even happens ah I agree fights happen at all of our schools I mean it's it's inevitable you you mix everyone together\nGive me one more suggestion that doesn't have to do with police\n\nWell [noise] I've said before copy what successful districts do\nRight\nWe we need to investigate what other successful district were not the only district in this country that is under a de sac order\nWho is having the same issues and we need to look at others and not only other districts but also what's going on with some of our other\nUh competitors in in a Tucson Dr leeman just was on what is he doing that's attracting individuals to come to his his charter school what his base is doing we need to\nOne of the issues that I have is we're not challenging or students to the extent that we should be challenging them and a lot of them aren't that stupid that's just going to go well we're just going to continue to do this we're going to I Want in education I Want something I Want something better and they go out and they do\nSo here's one was great and also so I don't go mark\nUp yet stop promoting students from elementary schools and middle school who don't uh who are uh you know don't really have to go no go and same thing from middle school to high school\nWell I I think I I think we now have a superintendent who's not going to be allowing that happen as much as the past\nActually market exactly what's going to fly out of my out of my head next which was the idea that we're still socially promoting kids\nWho first of all dumped you ... you said it that really can't their reading skills from elementary to middle school is horrendous right All right which is of course putting the kid a horrible stuff like child abuse so it is it All right then taking the kid for middle school to with no math skills you might stem kid right\nOr my teacher mark how many kids are you seeing I just don't have\nBasic math schools coming in the Tucson\nTucson Hi\nWell I'm afraid to say but it's got to be at least a third and I'm being generous\nThat descended doesn't apps yet but I I I bet you it's more than that [noise]\nAll right mark thanks for the call is always sort of have a great day thank you mark seven nine zero twenty forty is the phone number wake up to sun and Gmail dot com I keep telling everyone I'll say it over and over and over again if you are going to fix this community\nI Need Pima County fixed anti US defects are sowing your homework assignment you say bring up more students info what does that mean\nInto oh into sorry into into to us the God I didn't finish that don't carry\nA classroom support for teachers students and parents\nRight here's what I ... meaning by that is if if you don't allow a teacher to be able to control and manage their classroom students see that I I continue to equate it as a bowl of fruit you have a bowl of fruit\nBeautiful fruit in there oh that'd be my ... my banana this morning this is compelling ready [laughter]\nYou have a ball of of a beautiful fruit in there and you take one bad piece of fruit and stick it in the middle of that what happens to the rest of the fruit maybe it's rotten that gets rotten so we need to allow teachers to be able to manage their classrooms\nAnd start holding kids accountable and then the other students are going to start to begin to learn\nSo it to me it's like there's three basic says well to basics and to us we we just talked about the social promotion one right right that is probably the real\nThing I was socially ... ... they just want to get me out getting him out getting now\nSo I remember in the early days of the show the adult lead a crew socially promoted that do it on a vote\nI don't know a couple of hundred kids from junior high to that level whatever that I guess that was yeah I don't remember exactly ... years ago to override their they thought they were being compassionate right that's what that's what they they laid their head on the pillow and thought they were being compassionate in the end you're literally you're just you're sensing kids to a lifetime of working at Burger King\nDirect direct the sad part or be followers right I'm with you I I don't have any who's not going to think but lab so that\nSee that's the ... all this compassion you're liberal that they they they keep throwing out there that they're the impassioned the ones you're literally prepping kids for failure yeah and to be followers set at basically kind of a dead end economic life for most of them and that's the thin\nAnd I are quite that as the quail you have the mama quail and all the baby's father wherever the mom with quill goes no matter what we're off the cliff they all go up the cliff\nAs we're getting bananas in Wales today [laughter] and what was your ... you have a last friday a Tucson Hi that was\nSomething like that caller yes that went by ... just last friday or bad debt to crossing guards in in front of the agents on six three day in and one resource officer how they knew it was one resource I Want to have short but well they weren't looking inside his school as I say you\nKnow they probably saw the police car out front there was a pretty smart like Robert others to crossing guards on six director Brian Ross courage and then you we have some monitors on the other you have a litter of tend to whatever over there are so you could you have like right All right\nSeven nine zero twenty forty seven forty four in the morning let's get skip on ten thirty ... voice skip what's going on\n[noise] skip hot I I thought\nOkay we're having how can we help to the doctor\nI just why aren't you a check and regarding the only resource ... right I taught at a ... or a year out\nOr any or a five year old house and the two thousand five inch Yes sir\nAnd we have all these uh starts off I'm campus and in my opinion it made a big difference uh they were very ... and then and very much involved with all that\nAnd the students and I think just having their presence on campus is a positive\nThing for two reasons one it\nHelps the students on ... and that a large are not there to protect down\nAs well as his ass and it just showing that a person there that made a big difference in my ... and um I I think\nYou know they play a vital role in the overall security and the campus just from the standpoint of you know these terrible incidents where\nPeople are lined campus armed and start shooting in all if you have a a police resource a person there you've got somebody they can uh perhaps intervene and and not prevent or they're a loss like All right\nLet's skip thanks for the good call as always thank you were going to do one more segment you hold on for a more secular absolutely teacher bobbing Sean

different doing it with everybody ... all of my experiences are really pleasant actually wrote a letter to the\nUm she's on health department just saying their staff was I worked in a lot of cities with a lot of health departments and they were both professional and kind and a lot of times health inspectors kind of treat you um\nI don't know like you they know that they have a lot of control room and they almost are dismissive and they don't act humid or not to sound out inspectors were so kind and they were excited about the project and they were almost it was a pleasant experience which are really neat so all my ...\nWith the job and I do pretty much scheduled on no no of course not [laughter] but I think\nWe were supposed to open originally in March and then in July and then we finally opened and the end of August and even that was like\nThis whole is our pool gonna cause we expanded the pool and there was this whole is it going to get approved and did we do it right and there was the last minute things where we didn't do the titles right so we had to redo those marriage is like working twenty four hours a day right before we opened smoker um\nNo I don't think any when you're remodeling our project this big that it ever opens on time so\nIt's pretty old and\nYeah ... yeah I mean and we even had just I originally wasn't supposed to be in Tucson I was I'm going to be staying California as just a creative director and come back and forth for a variety of reasons personal and business and um we had\nDecided to hire a general manager who had a bunch of experience and hotels\nAnd then he ended up not working out and so I came on as GM and I had\nA lot of anxiety about that because I have management experience and I have creative experience but I've never GM the hotel and the only time I've ever seen it was watching taught him only a hotel conference room and it looks like a really stressful job so\n[laughter] and it is\nBut it's also been a really really neat experience like I said interacting with the gas is my favorite favorite part\nWell yeah and that's the thing so would you what I've learned is that if you're dealing with the certain really because there's so much available delivery of hotel rooms and yours was going to be different and unique writes yeah but a lot of problems can go wherever they want to go right\nRight and what happens is because of the corporate invasion of hotels and the whole told dot com and Chrysler him it's becoming a commodity for sure so what you're doing what you're trying to do with the idea that the thing that keeps them coming back to you is not necessarily just a ... it's the one on one yeah I'd like to happen\nAnd also the the aspect of being an art hotel I'm an only supporting Tucson artists and I think that people really like you can go in your room and read the bio of artists to me a dark room\nSo ...\nSo that was my original my original idea years ago was an art hotel in Tucson I've been there if you are hotels and they're very like um for lack of a better word fancy and high brow and the rooms are really expensive and the art is outrageously expensive\nUh and I'd

you know washed out roads or whatever thank you yeah who's all does that how long how long of the road when at what about your tips that you have better and there are certain things that no county or minutes of how the in the world can fix right it's just the way where we live right\nAh but you said he's in jail so he's northwest I okay I guess you have to go through of how many deaths that are what flood when ... you know when rain or the county has never built a road they just\nBlack top the debt it's like are you kidding that's that's how ... does things\nSo they just fix the roads with their quarter of a million dollars to shove this uh basically they basically saved truck Huckleberry legacy\nIs what this is about All right\nAnd some of them are road companies that are going to get money to do roads I got\nMy God I Know how that works [noise] ah so this is on\nTheir Facebook page so no one really cares about the gym and then sold in the Tucson weekly opinion no one really read that thing anymore\nBut one of the quotes\nFrom their endorsements is\nThis and that just fix our roads people\nAre using this as part of their sales pitch gym then sold basically wrote\nQuote critics of the proposal who are also the loudest constrict could critics of the conditions of the road are lying about how easy it would be the fix the roads without the money will vote hell yes on prop for sixty three they ... people okay not just yes Elia well mayor ed the hell no\nGuy uh okay so now Jim Insel is saying that quote\nThe no people are lying about how easy it is fix the roads with the current budget\nNow Jim\nI Know it's hard for you you have been suffocating in your in your in your bubble and this was an obvious suffocating inside your bubble now I Know it's ...\nI Know that your bubble goes out to about I ten maybe out to the Macondo goes out to about Campbell right\nEnds at about twenty seconds and maybe speedway which I Know that's your bubble that you'd suffocate in that's the only this is what happens when all you do is talk to people who think exactly like you\nKnow we took gymnastics all\nAnd we'll get an independent arbiter will get built Buckmaster to be the
