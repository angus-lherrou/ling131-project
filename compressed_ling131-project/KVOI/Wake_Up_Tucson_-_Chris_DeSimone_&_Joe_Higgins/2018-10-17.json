practicing ads have professional interior designer ...\nWhat is a project that we might know that is your work but we didn't know is your work until you're told us what something up into some\nThat the space that would be a Susan Mulholland\nWell let me ask you you know a lot of my work is really small I think private offices and not a lot of the public hospitality and hospitality senior living on right now we're remodeling and courage this restaurant\nOr reach us is in the process of\nRemodeling part of their entry way so it can be accessible for people who are hand over here and we're going to remodel their bathrooms\nAnd that and some of the tiny space so that should be completed possibly by the end of the air for the next year so that would be a great space for people to come and see what works\nWhen it comes to um office space right now and what are some of the trends and colors are designed right now that are kind of popular or more offices are kind of leaning towards\nWell trained right now is to have open office spaces where people can have an almost what you're listening to you right now a lot of collaboration and all that and\nI'm a ... and my wife with the cubicles I keep all those are going away there's a link or disappearing um the problem is now everybody's complaining about noise and about privacy attention from one state to the other\nUm resin Marshall is a big trend that people are trying to create a that's a cute phrase their ... their living room into their office and because a lot of people that worked for Homer time commute and so they want to sit on their couch and you know look at their tablet or their laptop and not have to be tied to adapt\nA technology has made a big an\nImpact in office design so with that you have conference rooms that need to be\nReally um computer savvy and technologically savvy and you need help spaces for people to\nGet down and dirty and talk on the phone without being interrupted so design is tiny involving like always an office space to killer and I'm kind of going morphine in terms of like usually are typically think that the topic\nIs why is this ... been ...\nWhat is why is this he'd been I'll also a longtime member of this group that is correct what ... what what what why is this group important to you and your business what do you like about this group\nThe camaraderie a we have a lot of people in this group for a long time and so when during this group I was a very young businesswoman and this group was\nNot filled with women in fact it was a pretty much in a men's only grip so when I joined it was just starting to become more women were members\nAnd I think having the ability to engage with a lot of different businesses and particularly\nOlder men who you know may not have had\nThe experience of working with women and ownership roles being young you know they took me under their wing and stuff like that like this was a good group to get to know\nHow to work with different ages and understand different business type and since I'm a commercial interior designer that's what I needed needed to understand how different businesses work\nWith a business lesson you learned from this group that's helped you and your business\nListening is probably a big thing and interior design is kind of a weird topic um most people they look in HDTV and they think decorator and they\nThey won the pillows but it was really different type of business model problem solvers really listeners we want to be able to fix something that's keeping you from being productive and so when they get a hold of that\nAnd they see that we actually provide value for their business\nThan it makes a big difference so you know talking to a bunch of guys about interior design sometimes is a little challenging but once they figure out what what I'm capable of doing they're very happy Tammy how\nIf someone's listening right now who want to talk to you about what you do and maybe they'd like to hire you how would they get a hold\nOf you to my Web site at um U.

it's the relationships that I find that are most critical and most are really fulfilling and out of that desire for the relationships the business leaders happen sure they just happened and it's it's way better than actually force\nThat is good and great for my business\nVery cool so that is a southern Arizona rain gutters incorporated his name's ... how do they get a hold of you Brian if they

president yup\nWe moved over to a local business a local restaurant we were at a more of a new franchise right and then we came over a puck on mom's during my term it was really important to me a good more local businesses\nSo every Wednesday morning seven o'clock\nYou're doing amazing breakfast with the folks here a ... a month and the and I think a very nice of you know and so for you growing your business other than in on top of the referrals and leaves in that network cause your network determines your net worth what else have you learned to make you a better commercial insurance agent\nYou know I learned something from every individual here every business owner every person they they have such\nWonderful gifts and if you listen to them they have such great ideas and it's about forming were more of a family than we are just a networking girls we do things together we rely on each other\nWe call each other for help for assistance [noise] more than I Would have ever expected front and that was\nWhat is your ah when you do when you go visit with a company what is the number one uh most glaring absence of their insurance coverage that usually is the one you kinda go more often go and kind of need to bump that up where would you what would you say\nI Would say employment practices liability\nThat sounds exactly right yeah yeah ... become it's become a nightmare and um I Would encourage all of your listeners who are business owners\nTo talk to their agents about ... coverage\nI Would like to add to that because you're totally correct is how many how many employers when they are have\nA issue with an employee\nNever put anything in a file about that employee like eighty percent of you know then what happens is when you do have to let them go and there's some sort of conflict\nYou like oh let's look at the file whom food to write down everything and put it in a file folks\nAbsolutely absolutely and a lot of these policies and the carriers well actually have HR departments that you can rely on correct\nSo it's really kind of a no brainer you're getting you're getting the help from the H R department and you're having the coverage help you in those instances and hopefully avoid those instances\nSo I have a few friends of my life that owned companies to transfer to different companies that own different kinds of companies that have no employees because of this is such a way\nYeah I mean that's that's possible but it's certain companies are growing so quickly right ...\nThey can't find enough people that's also problematic because you don't have control earlier right\nAnd then you have in turn over and then you're so busy that you're not you know you can't take that extra ten seconds to fill out a employee or a reprimand piece of paper and throw it in manila folder\nYeah so it it's critical\nHow do people get older you Tracy Jordan\nUh you can call me at code eleven and five seven one one nine zero zero or go on to our website W. W. W. Cody K O T Y heights I Love it and a key dot com\nGood spelling or like that Tracy Jordan code eleven insurance amazing to see you again young lady and her light wave technical consulting what's up there\nHey Scott thank you so much for uh actually putting this on and then being here with us and given us an opportunity to one or talk about uh the business association a Tucson but also promoter on businesses\nThat is what we do we advocate for small business and we are shameless wonders on her show\nWith a bat that robot we Shane Mosley plug it doesn't matter whether you're in the grocery line or a family member or wherever we're where we're at\nI mean the great thing about this group for fifty years has been that steady peace where they have a the members have\nSought out to care for other Tucson ends by giving them solid referrals to people within this group\nSo Erik Larson first segment says number one the first thing you learned being in this group is always have your business cards right in Iraq you're pregnant I Walk out of the door and forget your ... it's I think I don't even say lugging\nYeah it's like having your sort in your pocket or you know a weapon in your pocket always writing like a weapon isn't actually hurt anybody it's really about serving other people whether it's your own business um or you know we carry around a a a bad book\nWhich has a multiple copies of everybody's business card and we're always ready to pull out and flight out and say hey well call my friend Bill Nelson or\nCall my friend Dick Tracy Jordan you know you have you know we open conversations have you talked about employee employer insurance what's that have you talked about cyber policy I'm an IT person right you know it's easy to just open that conversation do you have a cyber policy I don't even know what that is\nYes I Am over fifty so yes I I Am ... thank you that was not an old\nJoke you made it an old joke I'm just saying you're vast experience\nYes I have lots of experience with in this industry and many other job\nIf you were sitting with are doing a seminar for small business owners and what is the top two mistakes that they make when it comes to printing and promote stuff\nThey want to spend too much on big item orders and they don't want a handout watts of things that are less expensive to get more of the word out there is the biggest thing parents are very inexpensive get lots of them passed milk is people do not throw them away they use more time\nIn business cards they're inexpensive these days full color get them done past not wherever you go to the Asian keeping your pocket all the time and your name always gets out there and I saw nice thick business cards with nice feeling to them nice texture and people don't put them down there don't throw them away\nThat or the end it's about name recognition direction and connecting to what you do\nExactly and also your logo do not allow anyone to change your logo smart shutdown changed the aspect of it changed the cause of it your logo is your identity keep your identity out there all the time so people recognized you whether you're walking down the street driving your vehicle or you're in a restaurant and you see that pan or that that logo you always are recognized\nIt's like political science right the people who put a zillion things on there that you don't understand\nExactly but fortunately those go away after the election right\nSo it was talking to our friend congressman Schweikert recalls up when you go to Scottsdale where he's a he has this big giant six foot signs that just say his last name right he's like I'm not trying to get my history I just want when you get to the polls you go see Schweikert fighters writer for oh\nYou have brand recognition cause outweigh the bigger the better and one of my pet peeves is too small you can't read it to the honesty of a type people throw it away 'cause they cannot see or read what you're trying

in their homes they can move up they can invest in their businesses find a little bit better location so things are good right now with the hot spots from town right now I mean uh everyone wants to be downtown we'll see what happens ah\nThat's where everyone wants to be but then when you actually do that the ... a mandatory out of the Internet or it's really hard so I mean you're going to have the popular ones Sam use a central to sounds really popular right now because a lot of the people want a little bit bigger backyard that wants to more space\nSo a lot of ... you know rejuvenation around
