T. events at Gmail dot com and let's get to earn a shape of order Horton\nRunning Schaffer Horton good morning how are you doing good how are you not too bad so last time we got together\nWe did a discussion about your started with your column that you wrote in the Arizona Daily Star correct and you like myself where a cradle Catholics\nMhm yeah we we love our faith yes um and um [noise] we some of these I'm probably nicer some of the challenges that are proposed that are opposed to us by church leadership or or disturbing in some of their actions are very disturbing to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll right\nIt's about a\nTwenty two minutes it's eight thirty nine so what is how to how they're going to relate that to to the top of the hour Eighteen minutes to the top the trucking traffic we have\nA couple of accidents luck and ... and ... there was an accident also has some kind of ... or uncle\nHit and run on twenty second street\n... percent just updated on me that that's good yeah the hit and run it's still good twenty second street between Osbourne avenue and freeway road and another accident possible injury accidents locking yada and Lambert\nThe uh north bound lanes of\nLuck and you're out of north of the Lambert intersection\nAnd on the freeway is looking pretty darned good I don't see any slowing or anything anywhere so that's nice mid eighties for the high under sunny skies today same for tomorrow but as we get into Sunday in the early part of the next week we're expect some showers possible thunderstorms and much cooler\nTemperatures by Tuesday Wednesday\nThe high expected to be in the lower the mid seventies and right now under mostly sunny skies have sixty two degrees at the airport\n[noise]\nOoh ooh\nOoh ooh\nNo just hit it right you did I mean it's a big fan of the theme and mix it with our earth the logical was hearing the same values are seeing things ever was thinking more of the forty one in the morning you're on the way to do some\nShow 'em in the end we need to increase the pool of priests out there\nWhether that's married priests women priests I'm up for all those discussions I just want the best people possible and you know just talking off air because there's such a lack of supply of pre so mostly steal them from Africa or Mexico or other countries that the bishops put up with people\nAnd lay down because there's no one to replace them right there's not I mean if you've been at Catholic very long you've everyone has had ... I don't know any Catholic who doesn't have a story like this where\nThey go they tried to talk to a priest about something and the priest is literally clue less and um that doesn't help anything\nSo and again I'm not saying these are bad people there are really great guys but some of them are not that good at their jobs just like some reporters suck at their job or some radio people maybe secondary direct\nAnd so um but there's not a lot of corruption because when I have I'm taking people who've had a bad experience with the present I mean something as\nEgregious as going to confession and being at let's say someone went to confession and talked about abuse that that person had entered for not by a priest but just in their life and that they were having real struggles with the faith because of it\nAnd they get a lecture by a priest about how they are just over sensitive\nThan that is not a priest who knows how to do confession very well and I take I help this person go to see the bishop because these this is a recurring theme and the bishop essentially says and this was in another diocese but I've had similar experiences in every diocese\nUm the bishop says well you know he's doing his best well his best isn't good enough not when you're dealing with\nVulnerable people which is what a Catholic who walks into a confessional is Milner\nReserved big concepts are dealing with here we don't need anyone who's fasten it right up\nRight and so so the bishops who were real good they should be more assertive in teaching their priests and if they feel like\nWe don't have enough priests which you're always hearing than possibly what we need to do is consolidate some parishes and that's a difficult thought for some people but it may have to happen to be able to have\n'em or even have fewer masses and better priest or like you say open up the pool\nTo women freeze and married priests and just it just because you're or have that discussion and I know that the you know the Vatican close the discussion on women priests back a ways back but it could be opened again and the married priests\nCould obviously be open again because we have the ordinary at right now where we take\nMarried former Episcopalian and Lutheran priests who are married and we bring them into the fold right and they serve and they are just fine\nNow I'm back to the third quality we talked about administrator because there's a lot of Catholic priests it's not it shouldn't be necessarily in their ... right but it is yeah so my take is I'm a of a big fan of less churches we have too many right now\nOr I Want fewer churches that are vibrant yes okay I have we have too many churches and their stagnant a lot of what I Want is my brother and I have talked about this too is\nTake the property management side ... away from the priests you're already have the beast called the dioceses which is your central administration ... have a division of the dioceses that their job is to make sure the administrative side of the church is taking care of\nSo all of your support crew of the air conditioner goes out the dioceses takes a rage has that has someone who's ... that's not the police job his job is just to say this is going on diets you take care of it\nAnd so they take as much of that off their plate as possible and what professionals who are good at property management administration do that side and there'll be a zillion people who would be willing to do that as\nWell so the and they do have a property manager for the diocese but he may basic he mostly handles the dialysis and major properties right I guess ... church was going to have to be sold he would have to be involved probably but um [noise] but on the parish level yes they need more\nHelp of people who do things and they need to be willing to let go right be was\nBecause at some of the issue is that there are laypeople who step up and they have you know they they will have a staff okay this person can handle this is going to handle this but when push comes to shove if\nIf Joe Smith wants to you know redo the landscaping and fix the the air conditioner and do this and do that he still has to go to father for permission and father needs to let go of Senate that for us and do the briefly kind of stuff and let 'em you know\nPick him concentrate on what the job is from the first time right right preach the gospel convert people's souls to Jesus Christ do you know to pay for the stuff that was part of your calling in the first right\nAnd act like Jesus in that Jesus was about service and not a power and that's where you know and\nThat's where when you wind up with any large organization it tends to\nDevolve into a power hungry kind of structure with the bishops you know arguing different sides and everything as opposed to you know kind of a simple question you know Jesus said what did he say to do love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself [laughter] so how are we doing that you know\nSo I Want to get to what we love about being Catholic in the next segment but one more thing about the pool and stagnant so service say the new bishop the two things that he's known for so far ... is the six page canon lawyer letter blaming the sexual revolution\nOn pedophiles or malaria files on the sexual revolution and he's got some ... us see some conference of bishops and he's like oh should we have ... penalties for Catholics who worked for border patrol and customs and border protection yeah and you're sitting there doing\nWhat the heck are you doing well\nAnd that was I mean that that's an interesting thing because it was like okay if you're forcing I think when he was trying to say is if if ah\nIf border patrol agents are forced to separate children from families which would be a a thing that would be against Christian a teaching should we then punish them where as I mean it was like it came out of nowhere no one asked him about it or anything I don't know why he thought he needed to speak up about that\nWhen you also have this other stuff that is and will then are we going to penalize you know this person for that and this person\nWell why don't I Want\nIt first came on and said well why don't we have an uncle penalties for Catholic politicians who are rabid pro abortion\nRights which has been discussed\nSo yeah but you you're going to go after the poor guy or gal working at the border patrol\nRight yeah and that's not and if they're just doing their job right so they don't have to and so there's\nKind of a yes or all have a little common sense for God's sake\nYeah I I think he's I'm trying to find his way", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson - Chris DeSimone & Joe Higgins", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "05"}
