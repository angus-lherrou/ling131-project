journal commentary [noise]\nI'm woman Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe White House office of management and budget has announced the Trump administration's efforts at regulatory relief that resulted in twenty three billion dollars in cost savings\nHere to talk about the lessening regulatory burden on business is Ken Cuccinelli can is a former Virginia attorney general now serves as director of the regulatory actions after after freedomworks foundation\nAnd welcome back to American radio journal can we know that the Trump Administration has made regulatory relief but top priority can you give us an update on the progress that the administration is making in this area\nSo you just put out a semi annual report and a lot of these things have been very boring in the past and frankly very burdensome that they're very proud of their work and they have every right to be the\nMost recent period of time they've they've saved annual savings of over a billion dollar\nSome period of time they've they've saved annual savings of over a billion dollars\nWith a lifetime savings of twenty three billion dollars and\nWhen you compare that to the same period for the Obama administration during the same period they imposed two hundred and thirty five billion dollars worth of regulatory costs and that produces nowhere else it makes no one richer it makes our economy poor by that amount of money because these are just transaction cost that\nBusinesses have to bear gesture exist so to reduce them as the Trump Administration has done and has made clear it's going to continue to do has really helped boost economic growth and opportunity for every American\nWhen you talk about regulatory costs on business most Americans of course don't run a business although everybody has dependent upon them for income so tell us a little bit in a little bit more depth what you mean by the term regulatory cost of the business what burden business place on businesses and how does that affect the ordinary worker\nSo she's a simple example when I left the attorney general's\nOffice of Virginia I've been doing a number of things since then but one of them you might not expect with three other people that I Know we started an oyster business in the Chesapeake Bay now and it's still going four years later it's going well ... oyster company in the tenure islands in the middle of may\nWell as you know seafood has certain safety risks with it\nAnd we have to when we pull the moisture out of the bay\nWe have to do it before ten am during the summer so there's not much sun and heat\nWe have to have them on ice and in certain temperature ranges and their reasons for that those are health and safety regulations somebody like me a very minimal estate person when it comes to government regulation thinks those makes sense that we had to take classes and learn them and so forth but if your business like\nA barber say you wanted to start a hair cut I'll call it a salon you have to go get it cosmetology license from your state\nAnd typically you have to take hundreds of hours of classes and this is just to cut hair let's set aside using chemicals and coloring hair and things like that just to cut hair\nWhy on earth should you have to do any of that and what does it do what it does is it doesn't allow poor people to just boom start up their hair cut business and I'll tell you what if I go to your business and you don't cut my hair well guess what I'm not coming back the market will take care of it\nWhen there aren't a health and safety burdens and issue government shouldn't be regulating it shouldn't be regulating and the federal government regulates building codes and other things that should be left the states and local governments the closer the government is to us the more response of it is to us\nAnd that that's a principle the founders talked about this isn't new\nAnd the Trump Administration is peeling away layers of federal regulation that give us more opportunities to start out small businesses\nOne of the things we saw in the Obama administration is a nosedive in entrepreneurial spirit that people America has distinguished itself in our history by our do it yourself attitude up by your bootstraps willingness to take risks and part of that is starting businesses well\nThe effort to start new businesses came to a screeching halt under the Obama administration but it dropped to record lows and that has all turned around a a very common response of the business person\nFive years ago to the burdens that government was placing on them was if I had to start my business today\nI wouldn't do it or I couldn't do it well that attitude is changing and you see it reflected in the optimism of small business owners and there are organizations that measure that optimism it's the highest it's been in decades\nAnd a lot of that is not because of the just the tax bill which is what a lot of people focus on his lower taxes it's because the government is making an effort an affirmative effort to get out of the way to expand freedom and opportunity\nAnd what's at stake here is something called the separate sovereign loophole in the Fifth Amendment now that sounds very complicated or legal easy but it's actually\nPretty straightforward most people are probably pretty familiar with\nThe idea of double jeopardy the idea that you cannot be tried and convicted twice for the same crime but there is this the strange loophole that effectively allows you to be both tried and convicted at the state level and the federal level\nFor the same crime and parents Marquez gamble\nFell right into that loophole a few years ago he was convicted in two thousand eight of second degree robbery and as a condition of that conviction and he was prohibited from owning a firearm under both state and federal law\nNow in twenty Fifteen gamble was pulled over by the cops for having me busted tail light they searched his car and they found a hand gun in the car so he ended up being convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and he was convicted both by the state of Alabama and by the federal government\nHe won't be released from prison till February of twenty twenty that he's\nThree years later than if he had only been convicted at\nThe state level now gamble has appealed his federal conviction on the grounds that he was being punished twice for the same crime which of course the Fifth Amendment explicitly forbids unfortunately for gamble\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the same behavior actually can be punished under both federal and state law without violating the ban of double jeopardy because the state and the federal government are two distinct\nSovereign but this doctrine of separate sovereign really has a bit of dubious legal history too when it first arose\nIn Eighteen fifty two case that had to do with fugitive slaves and then it was upheld by the court in a prohibition era case us v lands and both of those rulings are kind of looked down on nowadays as having been poorly reason\nSo this case matters because there's been a push to federalize so many crimes in recent decades and that means there's now really significant overlap between state and federal fences and that creates more opportunities for multiple convictions based on the same actions\nThat redundancy seems to conflict with the intent behind the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment and it also makes it harder for states and the federal government to set appropriate penalties since neither really knows what the other will do or if the other will even seek out an additional conviction for the same crime\nSo a victory for gamble in this case could mean tossing out a long standing but poorly conceived Supreme Court precedent or at least potentially limiting its use and that would protect defendants from facing cereal prosecutions for the same crime and ultimately increase liberty and and be a significant reform to America's criminal justice system\nSo that's one case to keep your eye on I think the other important criminal justice case in front of the court the session comes out of Indiana the cases Kim's the Indiana so what's at stake here is the eighth amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and the question of whether that\nProhibition applies to the states as well as the federal government the Supreme Court will hear the case here oral arguments in the case on November twenty eight the back story here is that titan Tamms was arrested in twenty Fifteen after selling heroin to undercover police officers\nHe's a criminal and he doesn't dispute that he pleaded guilty to one count of dealing a controlled substance in one count of conspiracy to commit theft and he was sentenced to one year of house arrest followed by five years of probation\nBut he was also required to pay investigatory fees and court costs and then on top of that the state of Indiana seized his landrover which he had purchased with money received from his late father's insurance pay out not from the proceeds of drug sales\nBut the state's took the car on the grounds that it had been used in the process of committing a crime basically that he had carried drugs in the car\nAnd so they had a right to forfeit now has appealed the forfeiture of his vehicle he's not appealing his conviction he's not appealing other parts of his sentence\nHe's only appealing the forfeiture of his vehicle arguing that he was already being punished for the crime ended at seizing the truck valued at forty thousand dollars\nViolated the eighth amendment ban on excessive fines and appeals court found that the forfeiture of the Land Rover was grossly disproportional because it amounted to a penalty that was about four times the maximum monetary fine for the crimes that teams had actually\nCommitted and was already being punished for\nIndiana Supreme Court however overturned that decision on the ground the ban on excessive fines only applies at the federal level and not to the states so the legal background here is really interesting and important the Supreme Court has long track record of ruling on on multiple occasions\nThat the various limitations on government power included in the bill of rights apply to the states as well as the federal government and that\nHappens because of the fourteenth amendment due process clause so in Nineteen sixty two for example the Supreme Court ruled that the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment applies to the states and in twenty Fifteen it reached the exact same conclusion about the eighth amendment ban on excessive bail but the court has never explicitly said\nThat the amendment's prohibition on excessive fines and fees also applies to the state and so the Supreme Court seems to have taken this case because\nIt gives them an opportunity to do exactly that to clear up that yes indeed the Constitution's ban on excessive fines does apply to the states and this would have important ramifications for civil asset forfeiture proceedings\nDecision applying the excessive fines close to the state level would make it far easier to challenge unreasonable fines and fees including not just for future but also cases were local governments have hit homeowners with massive civil penalties for offenses like unapproved paint jobs or having Halloween decorations up for too long\nThe fact that some local governments use those fines and fees as a means to raise revenue is ...\nThe fact that some local governments use those fines and fees as a means to raise revenue was created a perverse incentive to target residents unfairly or to go after people who are just minding their own business so a victory for teams in this case would be an important step\nTowards curbing that sort of local and state government abuse and it would also be a significant blow to other problems created by civil asset forfeiture\nSo these are two big cases gambling Tim's they're not cases they're necessarily going to capture\nThe news media attention they're not going to be all over the front page of the New York times the oral arguments here that take place November twenty eighth and December fitter worth paying attention to and the ruling when they come out early next year\nCould have important ramifications for the criminal justice system and I think more importantly for the rights of Americans the rights that are already and try and in the constitution but are not necessarily always present in the the actual practice of the criminal justice system\nOperates a magazine I married name will be right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe sprint T Mobile merger is now before the Federal Communications commission triggering a debate over competitiveness calling Hannah of let freedom ring usa has an American radio journal commentary\nAs a conservative I'm a fervent believer in the free market and the economic value of competition and those are usually oppose mergers because they tend to reduce competition competition keeps prices low and us benefits consumers there was a proposed merger that is now seeking government approval that is different however it's the proposed\nMerger between wireless carriers sprint and T Mobile has a long time sprint mobile customer I have more than just a passing or theoretical interest in this one and I've concluded that it's one of those rare mergers that is likely to preserve rather than reduce competition here's why\nThe mobile or wireless industry is complex but there are essentially two types of players one is what they call mobile network operators or em and those\nThose are the companies that own and operate cell phone towers and their networks there are four of them\nWere rising AT and T. sprint and T Mobile the other players like consumer cellular cricket metro PCS than US Cellular\nOr what's called mobile virtual network operators are envious knows there are dozens of them and they do not own or operate their own cellular networks they basically piggy back on the for him in those\nBuying access at wholesale rates the envy and those are fierce competitors and they're innovative rape plans and discounts hold down rates for every one\nOf the big for him and those\nWere rising and AT and T. or roughly the same size\nAnd each has roughly twice the size of sprint and T Mobile mobile industry is on the cusp of the next big technology and mobile communications called five gee the five gee mobile technology will carry more than twenty times the data loaded the card for G. technology\nThis means faster download times for bandwidth hungry applications like a Steve video\nAnd it's even more than twenty times faster for a certain other types of data five ... technology will be very expensive to implement however\nIt will cost literally billions upon billions of dollars and that's where this merger makes sense\nFor rising and AT and T. both have capital and access to capital in the order of magnitude required to roll out five gee sprint and T Mobile or capital constrained by comparison because of this it will take them longer to update their networks and in the meantime they will be operating at a competitive disadvantage\nIn a marketplace that values the latest technology and we're customer loyalty is it best to secondary consideration the result in likelihood is that for rising and they TNT\nWould pick off millions of technology obsessed customers from sprint and T Mobile further enlarging the too big players in shrinking the two smaller embryos\nIt wouldn't be long before they're easy pickings for mergers with the big two leading to only to long term and into survivors but if the two smaller em and those proposed merger is approved there would be three surviving him into sort of comparable size\nSo the question before the FCC and the department of justice is not whether it is in the public interest to go from for em and those two or three but whether it is better in the long run to have three and Mentos than two\nThree and Mentos will also compete more vigorously for the business of dozens of them via knows if there are only two and Mentos then there's a good chance that they'll ease into a kind of ... two players\nWho don't really compete head to head but rather decided to carve up the envy in a marketplace between them probably geographically that would further reduce competition in the mobile communications space\nThis stuff the end of the day you say one\nOf the older stuff really mean what does it really didn't\nKnow what I find ironic about this and I said this great truthfully at I don't say market thing but I was born and raised in

setting\nAnd asked me to speak and asked that question the last time I spoke at one of the films settings there my colleague was background was with me and my wife and a few others there were big names in Indian films out there and I asked to speak on life beyond the box office\nAnd one of the biggest names in the Indian film industry took me aside and those surrounded by students and others and he said to me to be honest with you on disappointed with you on TALK\nI said you're you said yes I said tell me you said you know what I struggle with I struggled with what goes on inside of me

India to make sure I don't start out with your team and end up with mine I tried to one of the team that has given\nBut I'll tell you what if you want me to address what you just don't get talked

in town hall which was a follow up on one I did earlier called useful idiots cruise control the premise of which is that many on the left whom land and considered useful idiots because\nThey would facilitate his ambition without really knowing what his ultimate ambition was which would include getting rid of them when he came to power cars they would assume that they would share it the latest piece I've written is called Soviet defector\nExposes ongoing efforts to undermine the U.S\nAnd it's about a propaganda and subversion expert by the name of Yuri ... who defected to the west in Nineteen Seventy\nAnd there are a number of videos on line and anyone who is interested in the interplay between the Soviet Union in their intelligence services and following up with now Russia and the west should listen to him check out these videos\nHe lays out step by step the strategies that the former Soviet Union used to use to actually undermined and brainwash\nEntire countries use it used to use is it really that they used to or are these the techniques that are sort of on the Russian playbook I\nBelieve they still go on despite\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in Nineteen sixty they opened up a university which they named at the time the Patrice Lumumba university named after an African strongman communists who they could trust to influence his country and their direction\nAfter the fall of the ... when wall they've renamed chip to people's friendship university but they have brought I was surprised to find that they have amassed over Seventy seven thousand graduates of this university anybody's namely no yes presidents of\nVarious African nations and\nThey've been cultivating people and communist ideology\nSince then foreign individuals and students and these students are selected with an eye towards those who would be compliant and able to be manipulated\nAnimals who maybe even might have more latitude after an election but\nHe didn't go to that university and I thought he went to one that was\nWell he went he was a graduate of Cornell graduated from Harvard law school\nThe Russians what's after the fall of the Soviet Union would carefully select foreigners\nWith an eye toward educating them in communism especially from countries that were formerly western colonies\nPatrice Lumumba was an example now according to your investment off and

them tipsy the whole time they were there he would have various method by which\nThe alcohol would not affect them and at some point in the visit of the foreigners he would withdraw the alcohol that would\nNot only create a little bit of withdrawal symptoms but get the people thinking and wondering if they did anything improper while they were under the influence and this is a pretty cagey way
