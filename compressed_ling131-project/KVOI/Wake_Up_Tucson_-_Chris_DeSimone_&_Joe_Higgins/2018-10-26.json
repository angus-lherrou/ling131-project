civil discourse exactly\nBut we were very civil towards one another but anyway um I really wanted to thank you to but I wanted to love this movie because uh Neil Armstrong has a special place in my heart because a growing up when I did uh we got to get up at five o'clock in the morning and watch it on TV how how old are you\nUh uh I Wanna say six yeah and so a basically a ...\nIt's the story it's been the Armstrong story now what they did a very good job of in this movie is telling you about the man right in and who he was as a person\nAs a father as an engineer the whole nine yards and that was a very good what I think they really miss the boat on with this story is the fact that this was the most watched thing and I think still to this day is true in the world\nI mean because every person on the planet looks up at the moon and probably wonders what's it like a little more than the ... the or at least percentage yes this will more than the ... the river or a alcohol vote\nAll Oh absolutely you know that was just trying to coke bottle but but anyway\nUm that's where I think they missed the boat because I I think everything else about the movie was really good there's one scene I just want to tell you about that I thought was fantastic so\nOr Mrs Armstrong is listening to everything on on the radio at home they have her hooked up to the the two the spaceship and she's here in all the\nRight and and what happens is uh they shut it off because there's a problem\nSo she's furious and she goes down to NASA antiques late and greets her and he and he says to her we've got this all under control and she says\nYou're a bunch of boys making models out a ball so would you don't have anything under control and she did it really really well and um it just goes to show your when you think about the technology that these guys did this when it's getting phenomenal because what we have in our iPhones is more technology than what was in that whole thing\nStart Rocco got health but you didn't so what did you like about the movie I in fact that they they they just skirted over at ... took about a minute and a half and they show all the people all over the world going oh yeah this is great at it and you\nKnow it had more of an impact we're going to this new ... absolutely I mean like people were talking about it for days and even as a young kid I was like wow there's a ...\nSo what you're saying is that the part of him on the moon yes was really short is that what yeah yeah and you know people got upset because they didn't Trump planting a flag that to me wasn't the most important thing it's the fact that he was there in the impact that it made on the entire world\nAnd how do you do a story on Neil Armstrong and not talk about that a little bit more\nWell yeah and and the ... I I didn't see that I and I get the flight thing though too because when they left\nOf the lead so this is where the line from airplane comes from Billy your spend any time in a Turkish president of or are there you go man very much\nMan it is it is a good good so they will surely a midnight and express Ninety six percent on rotten tomatoes eighty nine by the by the reviewers what's your next for the last one up is the next one up is a Nineteen eighty seven they'll last emperor one of the bed I probably ever made a it is the story of ...\nWho is who is the last emperor of China before the red guard takes over\nAnd he actually becomes amber I'm when he's two years old and two months or he's emperor for four years\nAnd then the collapse and he goes in in his life story it's it's it's really amazing but he goes from\nUh the emperor and in in in the fall in a ... head of the country to a playboy to a drug addict to a prisoner to a gardener\nUm he's he's done just about everything in his life the cinematography in this movie is incredible at one nine Oscars and it was you know it was done in Nineteen eighty seven bertolucci\nWhat's the ... who's a bertolucci yup just sensational in so many regards I mean just really really well done movie very cool I I you know I have not watched\nThe last supper and such a long long time it has its its captivating it's just really a wonderful slick All right what's your next one up is the aviator the story of Howard Hughes\nUm and I think the I think probably the best portrayal of him the man you know such an accomplished\nA engineer and in flight person who who just developed so many things or you know regarding the airplane eighty seven percent in on rotten tomatoes as only oh All right yeah Senate or one of five Oscars uh just just a\nFantastic story and it goes from his greatness all the way to him being basically and saying\nYou know uh I think this is a I Know a little got there like everyone like you know the ... the Oscars and all that stuff\nYeah I ... and I like I'm In um catch me if you can what Cate Blanchett won the best supporting actress for this so she plays Katherine Hepburn is correct and she does a really nice testing and what's really amazing about this one is the soundtrack\nOf it's really amazing from the big band stuff through they do a really nice job with that sure uh Howard sure does the music I think but\nUm this is a square says he film yup yup and him kind of going into the madness is fascinating it is so understanding his movie stuff\nYep and how big that was and then also the growth of Hughes Aircraft and unless they were doing and\nIt was just it was kept debating it for for for people who he was a little bit before my time where you were conscious of it but I mean just an accomplished individual\nI'm all for the guy from Pan Am I correct or any WAMC W.

I mean it is sensational\nThere's this one funny scene in the movie where\nA re goes blind at that I see I Believe at the age of seven\nAnd a and so he basically came up with all these techniques on how to accomplish things in one of the things where he gets introduced to a lot of women\nAnd what he would do is he would grab their wrists and if they were really sick he said well they're probably really thick so I'm not going to have anything to do with them right right and it was just got a ... a funny scene that I kind of remember but at the ... Ray Charles movie is sensational\nHe um this was this Tour de force you know and the more you find out about ray Charles you find out more about not just the genius of Ray Charles right but also just as influence is different crossed a lot of junk incredible\nMan and you know he self taught the piano is just actually worked in ... what's your next want to make a lot of called re by right next went

P. wedding and it's just a couple of people and a plastic rose it's not that these are like almost a ... one of them had more than fifty people there are these are big celebrations I think people are spending less on weddings and more on the reception\nAnd uh and so then they go elsewhere and do the dancing in the drinking but um so we've been to several days and we have a story a running next week on it so and re loves doing this it's a fun part of the job\nI'm real that are now out of their love him I anchor Patrick\nLeah markets Peterson right you guys are a Ninety ... percent plus voting area in the two you've seen all these candidates over the last ten years the barbers the mix values the Giffords or\nWherever else we throughout this race brought Jesse Kelly's guess all those folks are how would you rate these two ladies in relation to their ... one to a hundred or the rotten tomatoes or what would we give Annan Leah and their engagement you think with um this important area and Phoebe to\nWell you know if we had Gabrielle Giffords andme arsenic Sally in eighty to Ninety arranged we would have these two in a you know the zero to five rain all my I Do think that I drove through um [noise] I Will tell you this um kudos to the green valley Republican club who did heavily a\nA markets Peterson there and they fired some great\nQuestions at her um but uh this was again if you're a Democrat you're very unlikely to go to that and it wasn't well publicized and and uh but so but they did do a good job and it was on on uh on line somewhere so I I caught that one but\nYou know the disappointing thing is is that um if you can go back to the primary I felt like Lee America's Peterson should have been up there on the stage with the three people who are\nAre also in the primary and very strong candidates but it's very clear that didn't want her to go out and say something that would lose the race in the primary for her or damage her and so she just laid low I met with her earlier it was it last week\nAnd a or is it this week and then of course I did not request that uh we\nHad um she had come by the office at one point we of course early on were requesting her to come to the the forums and she had a lame what excuse for not making it\nAnd we have here in ... well I\nHave no other word for it um and we talked about it again this week and uh she had a meeting and to go to so she couldn't go to the forum which by the way was not\nA sponsored by the green belly news it was sponsored by a one of the Republican clubs there and um she did did not make it because she had to go to some sort of a board meeting and I looked at her I said which are running for Congress I mean isn't that a big deal\nAbout she put aside ... interim director of the Hispanic operatives\nWas actually a a a hospital board meeting or if it's found out or the district I don't care you're running for Congress and um it was pretty clear that she was just trying to trying to avoid\nHaving said that um let's talk about her and the issues and I think that she does know the issues I think she did well in the debate ... um I don't think she was\nUm [noise] uh I I've never thought that there is a winner and loser in a debate I just have never thought that direction but I thought that she did very well she showed a ... a definitely a better command of the issues and southern Arizona issues than and Kirkpatrick by far\nOr and so I think that that was a win for her if you're going to look at it that way and but anchor Patrick is seasoned and polish because she has been in Congress and she did distinguish herself\nA Kirkpatrick big among among um the other herself and the other six candidates in that race they had been out there doing forums for a you know well over a year and I really appreciate that I went to three of them for Patrick went to a lot of ... if she did and uh [noise]\nUh so uh a phenomenon ... about a year ago was that both the towns of Miranda and Saudi die we're so disappointed with bad service for the tens of thousands of dollars they were giving Pima County for animal control and you guys wrote about some of the incidents\nOf you know the one pit bull esque thing that was you know running around her dog day\nLater had nobody from animal control had come out day later killed a dog right and\nA same same thing so that that the big problem was with us as we we contract with the man will care Center for animal control services and the big problem was number one they just often just wouldn't show up when called\n... you know they had to come all the way down here that was a well we are paying you a ... and I told\nHim I said you know what I don't know and all my you know at that time eight nine years here I'd ever seen an animal\nControl vehicle down here another thing they weren't down here but it was a lot of ground for them to cover and so it was a tough job and I'm\nA then the other problem courses at Pima County kept raising the rates right hand and substantially and knowing full well that uh we didn't have very many options and then the town of ... what he did something very bold they told them to go stuff\nAnd they said we're going to start our own animal care\nUm control control department they did it say half person department he works He does that half the time anyhow the police and other ways\nIt was a bold move in the first year the the um figures are in and we're saving money and service is a lot better and uh the the numbers are that in um [noise]\nUh for one year we had paid forty four thousand for for a for a year from Pima County and the next year when we took it on it was thirty four thousand or so these are small numbers except small numbers add up the better thing though is the service and I think the\nAgent even if it costs ten thousand dollars more for the improved service after the bill would have been worth it\nAbsolutely but I Want to give some credit here too I'm John ... who was our police chief\nWho did a great job in hiring a young man named Andrew Vargas who goes out there and absolutely cares about what he's doing and you know he's doing it and he would have happened is that you know we'll get an animal and then it'll have to go off to um [noise]\nUh to we have now contracted with the humane society that's right I'm southern Arizona\nAnd before that happens he'll put the animal on Facebook and social media and say hey is this is yours let's get it before ... you know he gets shipped off to the pokey and a debt has paid off many many times so Andrew Vargas absolutely cares about this job and we really appreciate that but you're right the customers\nIs the whole reason that it works\nI look at Pima County even since both 'cause mine I Know Miranda thrilled with their situation now right you know and look at it so we talked with one of the stories we're talking about what the human animal control other than the twenty five million dollar doggy Death Star place right\nAnd then a absolutely and they deal with a lot of issues up there and I know that they're trying to you know everything from disease to I'm a to adopting out animals that probably shouldn't be adopted out and they have given us there ... figures uh and and their substantial you know we we we we know that\nThis has to happen with some dogs it's not an easy decision but I think there's a lot of concern particularly when they stopped telling people initially what the breed the dogs\nWere were were were basically whitewashing the brief characteristics of the dog\nWill go on the website what are these dogs look like well they all look like pit bulls oh you can't know that ah you know quacks like a duck yes we can do that\nAnd if you're going to put a dog in an unknown situation with kids or other dogs or whatever you'd be just assumed or a pit\nBull that's life held that help people with every you know about\nThis and I'm a ... and there was a recent report on on television and uh yeah so and and they um uh again nailed them once again now I Know that they do a lot they make a lot of judgment calls every day and sometimes you're going to get it right and sometimes you're not going to get a writer mark evidence of communications guy for the\nFor Pima County pointed out that you know we had X number of successful adoptions and this stuff happens on occasion bad decision is made well when you look at the documents on that that decision it was pretty clear it was a bad decision it should\nNever have been made and so are you are you're putting these animals into homes and uh you're creating a very a a safety situation\nMy favorite Mark I'm in one still was the big dog to kill the little that name a little dog\nHe said dog fights happen all the\nTime that was an unfortunate show up mark Mike Michael Vick alright but I met her very ...\nYou know but I I'll tell you that we are dealing with dogs and volunteers and all these you know and a dog comes in to the\nTo the care center and you don't know what the the history is on that dog and so they have a very tough job and we want to make sure that we are we to liberty we fully understand that we do feel\nThough that the cost we're just getting out of control and the service just wasn't there so why continue or and again very bold move on the part of the town of ... to\n'em and the other thing is you're right there's volunteers that's happening that are are part of the mantle of control\nBut you know cures to Christ in our back or whatever her name is she's making six figures and they got people making good money over there too so there's there there there comes to that too is that this is just not a rescue league with all volunteers they're supposedly high paid professionals\nSupposed to do policies that try to reduce the kind of stuff\nWell I think there are two questions one is what is the goal of the human animal care center and then number two what's the real goal of animal care center because I think what they tell us it's one thing but what they are doing is another and if you you can't rescue\nEvery animal it just simply can't happen and again I Know they're going to say no we we put some down because we understand that get to that point and we send them over the rainbow bridge however\nThere are a probably\nMore cases where that needs to happen\nRight and and um that's again not an easy decision made but it's a safety decision so listeners will sit me through the waste book they wanted to know\nA young son for sixty three kids right below the just fix or roads yes how heavy or they hitting green valley or it's or because the green valley council but there are a little thing they think they're good\nThe green valley council thinks that they are good that they have gone out and they have a a made up pitch for them a question that because they do get um roughly a third of their annual funding from Pima County\nAnd uh they do a lot of their work down there so I think it doesn't necessarily look good that they've done this or I Will tell you though that um I have talked to probably a dozen voters and they have volunteered how they're voting on that and uh it's it's roughly\nTen to Fifteen Percent or going for it and the rest are saying no um so I I think when it comes down to the people don't think bonding is the best way to pay for roads everybody agrees the roads are bad but there's confusion over exactly what roads these would go\nToward and uh the biggest question is whether the county has been a good steward of the money we've given them thus far nature is now\nA do you feel that it was mildly inappropriate for the green valley council to go in and have their vote on yes some for sixty three without actually having any one from the other side of the arguments are presented them you\nKnow it depends on how you approach that because you know the county came down in September and it kind of a road show on this and what they're saying is we're just presenting the facts\nBut my thing is they voted after the road show right yes they did and they are they they've been unabashedly in favor of it sure I agree to do I think it's inappropriate you know they do have some autonomy and um if you look at the a report that they have to file every year which basically says this is what we've done for the county and this is what we do\nFor ourselves it's about fifty fifty\nAnd um so I you can't take a voice away and can't take independence away but that's a very legitimate question I\nDon't I give you that just have Bogart show for Fifteen twenty minutes and just give the other side but at least you know you're going to happen but at the same make it look like a little bit of a little dog and pony show right I agree with you I completely agree you know I'm all for them I'm All right let's go pays the bills but some are great sponsors ten thirty have you on the voice round the wake up to
