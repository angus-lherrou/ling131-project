get a column kind of going through that that proposition in way Dan himself\nThe over you've had pretty much a a brand overwhelmingly positive response you were telling me\nYou spoke I guess you're pretty much on the speaking circuit everyday or nearly fifty groups or explaining what this is all about and you said a hands go up in the room when you ask well would you like to see our parks improve pretty much every hand goes up yeah\nThat's right it's been very encouraging the ah yeah you're right I think last week I spoke to the Peter how neighborhood association and\nIt was a very well attended neighborhood meeting and are actually council member ... introduced me and he poses the question to them and like\nI think I'm speaking to the choir and most of them it already voted also but it was still a great opportunity to embrace myself and get some feedback in terms of what they were hoping you know if the voters that approved the initiative but they could hope to see ... in terms of park improvements in their neighborhood and community park and it is\nProposition for seven and if you live in the city of Tucson and registered voter and I hope you are you will be eligible to vote on this many people I think that early ballots have been out now almost two weeks lots of people have already\nVoted yes in fact ... and this is a overall big picture two hundred and twenty five million dollars in general obligation bonds generated over nine years what's the footprint of this brand\nSure that's a good question bill so the propositions actually title parks and connections so the two hundred twenty five million over nine years we'll be I'm invested in a hundred of our parks or car I'm\nCurrently we have a hundred and twenty eight parks the proposition does develop three smaller neighborhood parks we have three new parks\nOr and then there's um so a hundred and thirty three million of the two hundred and twenty five goes to reinvestment in parks and then about sixty seven million will be devoted to what we call connections and that's a whole array of\nMobility oriented improvements sidewalks in areas that are absent a safe pedestrian court orders a

San Francisco is also the first city to be able to say that a hundred percent of\nAll of their residents lived within the ten minute walk them apart and I think that's one thing that I'm for Tucson miracle child scientists onto that trust for public lands campaign where that would be Argo right now we're a little over sixty percent of Tucson and live within a ten minute walk them apart\nLet's bring in now Sara Garrett gaffe an editorial page editor and columnist for the Arizona Daily Star [noise] so what happened\nIs there and columnist for the Arizona Daily Star [noise] so what happens if voters say no to death a proposition\nYou mean besides my shedding tears yes yes I mean if you will cry at that meeting with the city manager\nSo I actually took this job not knowing about the discussions or the potential of a proposition such as this so for me I Know my colleagues say isn't it like drinking from a fire hose all the things that suddenly you're focusing\nOn and and for me excited about but I was already bringing lots of ideas and maybe that's why the city manager hired me about things that would harness the interests of volunteer energy community partnerships\nYou know having to you may hear is a huge advantage um because of some of their their programs and encourage studies ah but yeah we were we were prepared to keep advancing with the resources that we have\nA being very aggressive instill good stewards of the\nThe funding that we were interested but we've initiated a for example power paint is a a neighborhood volunteer based\nInitiative that realizes just a fresh coat of paint on her a moderate picnic tables or a pool a bath house\nMakes the world is different so uh that and planting trees and uh just having a you know our adopt apart program and park watch expanded so we were already you know kind of developing our approach to to improve the parks but um I Can't be any more excited than\nYou know doing a cart will and bill studio here that I think proposition for seven should voters approve it it's going to be a huge huge benefit to the community\nWe talk about oversight or our caller Richard brought that up and what about maintenance of the parks okay people or or if they approve this uh what about yearly or one will the parks is their maintenance money built you\nKnow so that's a very good point also so the the general obligation bonds are restricted\nTo only capital improvements that doesn't go towards staffing pension retirement any type of a maintenance budget but we do have a a maintenance plan to place we've projected that\nOnce a lot of these improvements are in place\nOr we're going to need a from one point eight to two million dollars additional funding in our parks budget and the mayor counsel when this was given the green light to go on the ballot they directed the city manager to start\nPlanning future budgets to restore a a lot of the park maintenance dollars that were cut the other things which I think are actually\nMore important to emphasize is that a lot of the improvements that we bring are going to have huge cost savings on her current budget so\nTransforming existing park lighting a to Eli de saves a huge amount on our electric bill and also the smart irrigation improvements with computerized\nUh incense or control the irrigation out so you can actually give us healthier turf areas in the parks are at about a forty percent reduction in our water bill so things like that and also brand new items uh most of them come with ... that are you know eight ten Fifteen Years in length\nThose would be guaranteed for performance and a lot of our current and maintenance of dollars that we I kinda humorous they say we buy duct tape and band aids to keep saying limping along\nTo their useful life and we can redirect those as new things that are put in place to help take better care of others so I think we have a pretty solid plan to address of how we're going to cover maintenance\nSo right now you have a huge cavern black electrical up for your car fixed they care thing I've only got about a minute and a half left and Sarah or did you have anything else well I'm just wondering\nAt what will be what would part if it passes will park users be incorporated in the construction will they stay open or of all the parks have to close\nNow that's that's one of our more complicated challenges and that's that action plan that will be a discussing with the city manager and all the ward offices in that um\nBecause voters in the community in general will have been so excited that this passes but yet there's about a year and a half\nWait until they see ... hey what's going on with the part right so we're going to be front loading what we call the low hanging fruit there high impact high visibility lower cost improvements\nAh those up in the state of Maricopa have been pushing for wanting to son to have a elections in even number of years but I think that the city's kind of looking to see to get some backing from the community and hoping that people will say no to this\nYeah I think that we're going to have a piece um before the election from from the mayor weighing in on that it's something that\nUm they kind of gets into the weeds and uh uh the practicalities of Halloween action's worked in Tucson is different than other places\nBut it's a something that that is important even though it's kind of hard to explain in a thirty second today and it's something that that voters may not really give them much thought to\nAnd Jim you say in your uh your saying vote no on this near recommendation ah you concluded by saying fair warning if this doesn't pass it sets up a court battle with the state\nRight because of the state has a you know as you mentioned been trying to push the city's a across the state really into doing these I even elections at the same time it's all the other elections are held and uh and that's been successful in most cases and their their latest effort a basically with\nThe cut to the chase would would take state shared revenues away from the city unless they moved the election even years\nWhich is a big financial hit\nA our charter which is approved by the voters a says that the elections shall be held and the odd numbered years and and you can't just change that without a vote of the people\nSo that's why they're putting it up a this year I think that ... the argument against it is that basically you know we have a lot to look at in a midterm election presidential election you as the the uh\nThe legislative races you at the congressional races you have US Senate races sometimes a gubernatorial presidential elections propositions\nAnd all the rest a county elections I'm so by ... by having a city elections and the other years you sort of a allow the media to focus solely on on those city issues and\nAnd bring some light to those specifically rather than getting lost in the shuffle of everything else that said obviously turn out in the city elections is far lower than it is in a general election so there's certainly an argument in terms of voter participation and voter engagement\nOn on that side of things so uh you know I I just don't like getting pushed around by those guys at the state so we're we're saying vote no ah and then we'll see what happens after\nThe third a local proposition ah that folks will be considering a has to do with the Pima County road bonds this is proper for sixty three Sarah\nAnd uh we had Ramon valid as on the program yesterday and the supervisors admit if this thing goes down there is NO PLAN B.\nRight yeah it's a one of those things that that needs to be done the roads we all know need to be fixed and that has to be paid for somehow\nAnd Jim you had a very enthusiastic yes on this one on your recommendation\n[noise] yeah you know everyone complains all the time about the condition of our roads and and I think many of them have gotten better in recent years at least within the city of Tucson because of voters have approved a a a first of a a a a\nBond package and then a sales tax temporary sales tax in order to get to fixing the roads and a lot of the roads I drive our on our end and much better shape these days as a result of that and I I think we should move forward and start fixing these roads the rest of the ones that are out there\nBecause uh you know the longer you wait the more expensive it is to actually get around to fixing them a and they've tried any number of options until they've come to these bombs or the deal is pretty good it's a short term bond it's about three and a half years to pay them off which means there's not a lot of an interest hit on that\nUh you get the money you get the roads fixed again the\nThe uh the Pima County is retiring bombs they don't have to increase the tax rate in order to pass these and I I just I find it fascinating that the people who are most against this are the same ones who complain relentlessly about the condition of the road it's almost as if they don't want to give up having something to compare\nAnd and I I just\nYou know we've we've third I think according to your show complained that there wasn't enough money for district one in there so he wasn't going to vote for it and and I find that just strange because roads are uh you know I I don't I don't only\nRoads are uh you know I I don't I don't only drive the roads in my neighborhood if I drive part of town I'm using the ... it's not a very provincial thing for me and other people may not tried that much outside of their own neighborhood I don't know but\nI I think there's also an economic development argument to be made in terms of of ah\nBeing a more attractive place for people to set up a business and and I honestly think it's just a quality of life issue and it should be resolved it seems like the last best chance to get it\nSarah this is the time of year that editors like yourself story page editors really do hear from the readers and of course\nUh the Arizona Daily Star has been making a endorsements uh can you kind of give us just who makes those endorsements can you give us a brief overall picture\nI Would be happy to um so\nI'm the editorial page editor and in the newsroom and newspapers generally speaking\nUm the news side of the\nNews room the reporters for news uh sports features a metro\nThey are separate from the editorial page we're editorial journalists we're opinion journalists um and so we are it's Luis Cosco myself or the editorial a department\nAnd um we as are part of what's called the editorial board which also includes our president and publisher John ... do in our newsroom top editor Jill Jordan spent so what we do is\nFirst fits is not some people think fits is said part of the board\nYeah fifties as David said some and used to be part of the board um there were a lot more people in the editorial department as well but um he is not a a on the editorial board so he does not weigh in on our endorsements\nSo we invite other candidates and the races that we've decided we're going to use our resources to a weigh in on and ah\nSometimes usually they accept sometimes they don't we like to have them in um all the candidates running in the same race at the same time 'cause it's kind of I mean you want to compare and contrast uh we do a lot of research on on the different candidates ah\nAnd then when it comes time to decide who to endorse we have lengthy conversations\nUm and that but it's a John Deere land or president publisher Joe ... editor movies Cosco the editorial writer and myself um we have we talked about things we\nAh go through you know what do we think about their position on education or the environment or economic development things like that\nAnd we go back and forth and I know a lot of people think that we\nOnly endorsed Democrats that's totally not true and some people think that we endorse Republicans only to throw a bone to conservative readers and that's not true either\nWe look at that can ah candidates and the given race and evaluate them I'm On the merits and sometimes people agree with that sometimes they don't but we're not saying you have to vote this way we're just saying we've looked at all of this this is our evaluate\nYour recommendation yeah OK gym or do you want to weigh in on that or can I Move on to some of your uh other state props\nLet's move on okay um the marquee prop would be the uh the energy one would you say prop one twenty seven clean energy\nI'd certainly say the most money is being spent on it and and a whole lot by ATF\nWho has been winning and a lot more politically in recent years a lot more aggressively uh and and definitely not and supported solar energy I we're we're saying yes on this one we think that\nAh that direction atheist wants to go in with a natural gas is is ah we you'd be better off going and literature solar given the amount of sunshine we have in our state and that's where the investments go\nUh basically there are are ah people who disagree with that assessment\nAnd vouchers that one you guys said no one\nVote no no no no no I was raised more money out of the public school system and and there's a whole bunch of flaws with this including the fact that there's no set aside for the very kids were being benefitted by this program at the man who are benefiting from this program at the moment the the disabled kids or the military kids are they\nNative American kids there's no set asides and this one is probably going to end up just helping people who can already afford to send their kids to a private schools to get a little bit of a tax break we think that's that's not what the program ought to be set up to be if you're going to send your kid to a private school you should foot the bill yourself\nSarah is they're going to be a place that someone who go to see all of your
