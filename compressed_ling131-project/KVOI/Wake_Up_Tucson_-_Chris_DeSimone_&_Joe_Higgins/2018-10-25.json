thing you know when is that that's the semper eight Saturday ... will be our Christmas we used to go to Allison some gas to Bach that'll be the Christmas spirit fun sweet before we get to the rabbit hole we both got a message from your beautiful wife\nWho's written a if like Christmas present in our living room nights out of bed lucky for coffee [laughter] area was too early for prima county budget talk [laughter] I just got here\nBefore the break you talked about he got into the rabbit hole of Pima County budgets and I see your wife came down the stairs morning on it and you put the finger at what\nHold on [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise]\nUh to the four year old to go after Rick [laughter]\nReading David Hume yes and you thought about Pima County budget and direct and then you kind of went down a little bit of the rabbit hole in relation to Miranda budget and comparing\nWell struck that right came that came later so let's let's let's set the stage to make sure everybody understands what a budget spore ... what's the budget for\n... fully it's they planned aloe cash right resource it's a planning\nDocuments right it's not it's it's nothing but that other it's got a little bit of a compliance think some people have to do budget for compliance purposes or you know to help with taxes or whatever but the core function of a budget is for planning purposes right and so the document has to serve that purpose\nIt has to give you the information needed in order to plan and see if you kept a plan right right so budget has to be structured in a way they clearly gives you that kind of information\nAnd so this is where I I like I said for myself or my family for my clients when we're doing consulting it cetera\nThat's the first thing I have in my mind and it's why a lot of times we go down trying to create sort of capacity budgets are profit center budgets cetera because you want these functional specific things\nBecause you can kind of attack you want to attach expenditures to value propositions right is what you're trying to do so that you can prioritize right you want to say\nAnd sometimes it's uncertain in fact many times it's uncertain it's a very difficult things sometimes is to say this is the value I received from dysfunctional area right okay\nAnd then you have to think but once I have a a stylish that okay here's how much we can spend on that or here's how much we should be spending on that train wreck\nIt's why a lot of times you know when it's that you know in public a government it's it's you know public safety roads parks right a lot of times when you when you go out there and kind of do it that's where a local government kind of Lance in terms of their priorities right so you want a budget\nThat clearly if you could spend your there's lots of stuff that would be good to spend on right there's lots of wonderful things in the world but in the end there's only so much so many dollars\nAnd so you set up a budget that allows you to prioritize and if those top three things are funded totally sufficiently and you have leftover cool let's do some additional you know outreach or let's do some economic development or whatever but keep ... first things first right right but you have to have a budget that lets you do that\nBecause there's lots of ways to set up budgets in fact I deal with this with our with our business we've we've struggled with this getting you know the budget to show us what we needed to show us so we can make these priorities other companies have the same thing um\n[noise] I think uh was it a quick Chris ... who was the release from the Hispanic Chamber Carlos ruin heartless I'm Sorry 'cause he was saying something like we can't run our businesses this way like that was the the quote that I thought it was in the ... and literally I was ... I was looking at the reason this came up\nThe reason I kind of went further down this rabbit hole\nIs because the debt quote from fume\nSent me to the Pima County budget for some examples I Am reading it while listening to your show from yesterday or whatever 'cause I'm just trying to be up to date with where we are before I come in and I'm looking at Pima County budget and I hear Carlos sure we said we can't run our business is this way and I'm like\nOh my gosh you're right you can't run your business that way you cannot see looking at that thing it's a hunt your on page one hundred and twenty two before you see a budget number\nIn on the Pima County budget that I'm looking at it right now I Wonder if their teen I'm Sorry and that's the revenue and these top line expenditure things out about eight hundred and twenty three page budget\nNow that to be said I'm not saying that the budget shouldn't be a thousand pages long it's a big budget it's a big county we have a lot of stuff going on it can be a thousand pages\nBut I grew up with Gary Davidson talking about Proctor and gamble is one page memo system right right it is again first things first what's the top line information you need for execution right right then\nIf you need the supplemental if there's a question you can have thousands of pages of supporting documentation reference material correct if you're reading it it certainly doesn't make sense you have a question about that show me the show me the specifics well then you begin right at the top line should be the top one\nRight correct I Need right up front what is our functional areas revenue and expenses that school revenue always comes first like we always ah you're on your show and me we're always talking about Pima County is you know expenditures so when I look at the budget the first thing I wanted to see expenditures but\nCommon accounting practices as you show the revenue sources first sure then you show the expenditures so that's fine\nIt's our prayer as a business when you're happy with that there's something left over after we take one away from the other\nBut you literally get to um expenditures and is expenditures you know it is personal services operating expenses capital out like\nThose those that's as descriptive as it gets early on now I'm not saying there's a million details in here but what I'm saying is as a managerial document what I Need or what priorities did we set out what functional areas are we spending on show me where the money's going in terms of outputs\nRight that's what's needed not you know outputs take a combination of land labor capital a little bit entrepreneurship you know some risk taking whatever these are the combinations that give you outputs but as a decision\nTaking whatever these are the combinations that give you out but it's a decision maker what I Need to see is how expenditures matched to the ... how do we expenditures match to what are we spending on the streets\nRight not how many people do we have in the roads department or blah blah blah you know where's our priority and what are we basing that on your expenditures directed it road maintenance\nAnd on what basis do we come to that number on what basis do we say that's sufficient for deficient do we know how to fish and her ... and it is\nI think the ... you can correct me I feel like they have a kind of departments in a way I think it's a fish okay right like there's you know parks and national resources shirt that kind of thing there's might be public works right that kind of thing and\nDifferent outcomes just by having a different sort of structure\nOr maybe we do again I literally was looking at other stuff that I've been reading for weeks and thought we were going to talk about looked at this and the difference was so stark then I'm like\nThere is something here that should be explored the difference in these budgets\nAnd then it's probably all going to go back to who's leaving who's in the leadership positions well why where are you\nI think that's where we could land this plane but let me explain when\nChris posted this thing about about Miranda I'm cancelling a sales tax write right after it accomplished the capital outlay it was to fund bright shining funded the police department and then they cancelled it and so I was thinking hey OK I'm having this trouble understanding\nThe Pima County budget and how it could possibly be put together this way because budget you're supposed to be manager and again I'm trying to be very um charitable here it may just be that there's a whole bunch of laws in place that just require the thing to look like a mess\nThat it's theoretically possible that's plausible like that's not just ... pop right that is plausible right and so I look I look at this and I'm like oh but there is that ... thing you can glance at the Miranda budge [laughter] glance at the Miranda budget\nAssume they're under similar if\nThere weren't any of that ... by the state or whatever\nThey're going to be under similar so and again it's one it's one data point right um but it's one that literally just had it has this history of seeming to keep fiscal sanity right right amongst what would be again plausibly similar regulatory constraints right yep so I pulled this thing up\nAnd immediately you know first first example you know the budget starts on page Nineteen actual numbers right okay versus one twenty and then maybe right I'm\nIn the preface information there oh one of the funny things is in both of these there is this certification or him Moran as it is earlier again right much more efficient but in both there is the distinguished budget presentation award [noise]\nBy the government finance officers association so anyways both of these budgets have this same certification so okay whatever however much that it's worth but on page Nineteen versus page a hundred and Nineteen we start getting the actual Moran a budget\nOr it's a hundred and Thirteen I don't want struck the manila envelope you sure right right right right so a hundred dollar seem to get to the actual budget and Pima County or something that looks like it yeah page Nineteen them into\nExactly and I can't see any you know again I don't know why but let's just say it's not buried his foreign\nRight there upfront budget philosophy the budget is a long range plans by which financial policies implemented in and controlled ... this is the marina budget when you start digging into this now\nYou immediately you get a little bit of the scheduling but then right up front you get financial policies and I can tell you I've looked through the list at the counties and it's very like\nThese are very wishy ... you look at them yourself in again maybe I'm missing these really specific goals that are on page seven hundred and forty seven right maybe right this is page twenty six\nIn marina revenue goals new ongoing operation costs will be funded with permanent ongoing revenue sources okay these are just some examples debt management long term debt shall not be issued to finance operations\nKind of relevant to some stuff we have going on right now right these are policies right and it's right up front and you can see what it is then as you start flipping through you get the financial\nSon type you get revenue by category expenditure by category they then go through and give you a summary of every certain every specific revenue source what it's allowed to be used for the purposes that it will be given what a description of it is\nYou get into expenditures and this is where you really get this is the really important thing right up front again we're a page forty one right\nCan I ask how long the morale of the Miranda budget as total up\nTwo hundred pages okay yeah so it's still it's extensive and again you're dealing with a with a a you know it's a tenth of the size or something like that I mean it's a smaller budget right but I don't see anything structurally about this\nAnd again we don't need to deal with any numbers we're talking about the structuring of how they present their budget and how they do they're planning right not specific numbers right but here's one this is the one because within companies you get this all the time is this\nYou know the accounts just want to give you the line items right right actually for managerial accounting I Need by function\nI Need sure okay yeah I Know that that's my total W. twos and that's my total power costs whatever but how much of that joy allocate to this department to create a costs center correct right and us a profit center when we look at what their value is to us\nRight here at the top of the expenditure summer summer is operating budget by function K now remember we talked about the five\nKinda breakdowns that I saw again these are early kind of glancing stuff in the Pima County budget but here's how Miranda breaks it down their general government again I don't know what that is I actually I actually a\nAt this morning I'm like could you explain to me what goes into general government because the ... the revenue lines they give all these explanations for and I'm sure it's deeper in I'm sure it's in your somewhere but again the point is I Can't read thousands and thousands and thousands of pages where every year just to understand what the different ... are going on but I don't really have to be\nIn Iran I just is literally the government catch all category that doesn't fit in with something\nBut think about these functions compared to the five kind of two out of five but we had no idea what they really were three to five kind of made sense but here's marinas break down its general government economic and community development public safety highways in streets [laughter] right [laughter]\nCulture and recreation water waste water airport these are functional areas then they then go to operating budget by line item and they talk about like personnel okay\nThis is personnel this is operating spent this contract services when I looked at the Pima County budget again I have not read all eight hundred and twenty three page at home but I don't have to with Mary Anna ... break it down both ways and they do it right up front front and that's what I'm saying I don't have to get into any of the numbers\nBut at first glance that snap shot I can see and when you get actually deeper in every single when you start getting into the department and stuff and again this is early right I haven't crossed page hundred\nWith Miranda but it's this is what the the council and mayor said we're the priorities here's how we met it here were objective here's what we did these are the you know things they did here's our accomplishments and they are lining the budgets to the goals that were set by the mayor and council\nRight right and I'm not finding again maybe it's somewhere deep deep in that kind of specificity I found some goals right in some descriptive stuff in the Pima County budget buddy it's real kind of vague stuff\nAnd then when you look at which count you know which of these governmental\nEntities just implemented a tax bill to police department cancelled the tax write versus which one is asking for debt\nLong term debt for operations and maintenance expenses well I mean it's the one that has a budget structure that lets them prioritize\nWhat's amazing about what you're telling me on the characteristics of the ... budget to the\nPima County budget it they truly are manifestations\nOf the attitude that I've observed over the last so many years of both government right where Miranda is easy to work with mhm right when I've seen this in the development world are businesses where Pima County is not easy to work with\nMoran is pretty open about a lot of their stuff right Pima County even with two million dollar if people are a government minister propaganda department right they seem to tell you nothing\nOr tell you a little as possible compared to what Miranda is feels like an open book yeah and then Moran is attitude has always been how can we help you yeah where or of a a Pima County like why are you bothering us that's a ... and I see that as a manifestation of what you described in both of their bud right\nAnd the and the first complaint that somebody would have er first objection that I Would predict with what I'm Talking about is it going to say oh well mine is so much smaller\nWith what I'm Talking about is they're gonna say oh well mine is so much smaller\n... I'm not talking about numbers or anything like that like okay yeah you don't have a public health department and the local municipality that's a unique function of county government is they handle public health stuff right right but there's nothing keeping Miranda from sticking a little wedge in this pie chart that says public health\nBut then you would have public right right right there is nothing to keep them from doing that right for and so it's a structural thing that I don't see anything in here\nThat would cause this structure what one of the things that I Love is when you get down to the expenditures they give 'em projection of financial condition conditioned by fun group\nSo it's all of this matching\nOf permanent revenue sources to expected expenditures and showing how everything is structurally sound out\nYou know many many years right and so again it's just like when you look at this as a manager I could look at this and go oh I have something this is an action oriented document not a checking boxes legality type docked it's almost like I've I get\nIt's almost like a truck has developed his budget based on he has a a ... a deputy county administrator in charge of those areas right and that's how he's done the budget yeah that's why there's five with", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson - Chris DeSimone & Joe Higgins", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "25"}
