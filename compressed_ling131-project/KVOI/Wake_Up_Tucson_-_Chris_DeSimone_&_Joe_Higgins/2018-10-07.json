S. forty percent of the kind of have to be made\nWith workers who are paid sixteen percent\nAnd our sense these are all prevents that increases the cost of doing business for an automaker and this is all for the purpose of paying no duty between when you're export cars victory in the U.S and Canada and Mexico\nPresident Trump of course are and they had placed the number of tariffs on various Canadian goods did the imposition of\nThose tariffs have the desired impact of bringing that Canadians to the table and make concessions did that actually play a strong role\nAt dinner because TPP already got these concessions from the Canadian dairy remember for the most part there were no terrorists between Canada\nAnd the U.S and they're still keeps a lot of the protectionism that had that was tell an aftershock and so it just created this chaos by withdrawing from the BP\nWhich had a lot of these features event and posing metal in Paris and threatening was out of terrorists getting concessions that we would have gotten and TPP and by the way they met all terrorists are still so we're worse off than before\nAll started you referenced TPP a couple of times in your answers are any listeners who may not be familiar with the term what is TPP\nCould be the way the multilateral trade agreement between\nA bunch of nation not not Europe and also a lot of Asian country and the purpose wise to create more free trade and and the purpose of multilateral trade or by the way everyone gets a little and the Canadian had agreed to reduce their ... they may have actually kind of\nGive up a little bit more than and TPP back but also the second\nBiggest biggest goal of all of that is to actually put China back against the wall by creating this very attractive free trade zone between other Asian countries and countries and and the U.S and Canada\nAnd and also to exclude China and the only way China could have actually joined west to agree to concession on IP protection and on a state owned enterprises a lot of the things that we claim I Want to see from China\nEither President Bush drove from TPP and advance threatened to police drove from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old NAFTA was unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo bottom line here Veronique is this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvements for sure I mean that's the idea that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before the rise of e commerce and things like that that needed modernization seven of a deal semi stale dies\nAnd that's a good thing and then there are some as I said the at the slight opening up the dairy market for Canada is a good faith also it what it does is that it increases the threshold for selling stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low and so that's that's a good thing but the\nDuring the confirmation hearings for judge Brett Kavanaugh who of course is president Donald Trump's pick\nTo fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and that was left when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement earlier this year now by the time you're listening to this is very possible that Kavanaugh may have been confirmed by the Senate it looks like we're going to get a vote within the next few days but that doesn't mean that this debate over\nTerm limits or the lack of for Supreme Court justices will go away indeed as I said it's a debate we've been having for a long time\nSo long in fact that Alexander Hamilton actually tackled the same question in federal is Seventy nine\nHe contrast it the lack of any limits on Supreme Court justices ten year with rules that existed then in New York state that forbade anyone over age sixty from serving on the bench and Hamilton ultimately dismissed worries about judges becoming unable to discharge their duties because of advanced age he said this is an imaginary fear\nBut of course two centuries later there's still no limit on how how long Supreme Court justices conserve\nAnd that actually makes the Supreme Court an outlier not just among global democracies but even within the United states because almost every state has a mandatory retirement age for judges usually it's Seventy or Seventy five somewhere around there\nAnd some states also require sitting judges to face the voters that pre determined intervals for up or down retention elections so\nIt it's not as if there was a full scale election for judges but there is some sort of a democratic mechanism there and many of the arguments in favor of placing limits on judges age or tenure are pretty much the same today as they weren't Hamilton de concerns about the mental fortitude as elderly jurists for example\nOr about a Supreme Court they could grow out of touch with the nation who's the laws it reviews\nIf all the judges are too old\nAnd unlike in Hamilton's time it's hardly uncommon for judges to remain on the bench well past age sixty and indeed the average age of the eighth Supreme Court justices that we have right now is is sixty seven years Ruth Bader Ginsburg for example is eighty five she's the oldest and says she wants to remain on the court until she is Ninety but\nThe acrimonious fight over a judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation has given this debate over a lifetime appointments and new angle term limits has been proposed as a way to make the current system fairer that's what David Leonhardt argues in the New York times he says that it would also in part other benefits like removing aging judges from the high court\nAnd giving the senator more predictable schedule for knowing when confirmation hearings are going to happen rather than they just suddenly pop up whenever a judge decides to retire or happens to die now the most well formed plan for term limits comes from fix the court a nonpartisan group interested in making the Supreme Court more open and accountable\nThey also favorite things like TV coverage of oral arguments and making the judges file financial disclosures every year fixed the courts favors a fixed Eighteen year term for judges allowing every president to nominate a new justice in his or her first and third year of each term\nSo you'd have Eighteen your term limits and if those had been imposed in the past the current makeup of the court actually wouldn't be very different than how it is today\nRight now there are four justices on the court who were nominated by democratic presidents and there are four seemed to be five\nWho were nominated by Republican if you go back in time and you implement fix the court system the current court will have a five four Republican slant for judges from the George W. Bush administration for from the Obama administration one already appointed by president Donald Trump in his first year in office\nAnd you would have Trump now preparing to replace one of Bush's judges as soon as next year when that term would expire\nNow this arrangement fix the court says it would solve the problems with the court that have led to the extreme partisanship and harmful polarization that we see today and I think this appeal to civility is one that might find a receptive audience\nAfter the rancor is an awful Kavanaugh hearings but what term limits and the predictability that they provide really save us from the nastiness that we've seen on display the last few weeks well\nI'm somewhat skeptical when the stakes really be that much lower if Kavanaugh were in the running for an Eighteen year term on the court with with everything else being equal in other words if the current conservative liberal split\nAnd the potential fate of the abortion law were hanging in the outcome the promise that Kavanaugh would merely sit on the bench for Eighteen years we're probably not bring Democrats down from the barricades and\nNor would it make Republicans any less likely to push for his confirmation\nBut even if you will term limits are actually a bulwark against the hyper partisan environment that's increasingly spilling over into the Supreme Court the idea might be worth considering for two other reasons\nFor one people seem to like a recent morning consult political poll found that sixty one percent of voters favored term limits for Supreme Court justices including majorities of Democrats Republicans and independents\nAnd for a second reason it would openly acknowledge something that everyone already knows\nThat control the Supreme Court is a reward for electoral success now this goes against what the founders may have intended they wanted lifetime Supreme Court appointments to buffer the justices from political interests but it's clear now if it wasn't already that both sides Democrats and Republicans view Supreme Court appointments as the spoils that come\nFrom controlling the presidency and the Senate\nSo it was the high court is going to be politicized anyway maybe it makes sense to have those seats the democratically accountable and actually reflect\nThe results of elections over the previous two decades which is what the senior term limits system would accomplish\nNow imposing term limits would require a constitutional amendment that's probably an impossibly heavy lifting the current environment\nAnd there's plenty of other stumbling blocks to in all likelihood nothing is going to change will continue to muddle through with the same somewhat broken process that we're using now term limits or the lack there of will not fix the underlying problems plaguing all aspects of the capital confirmation process\nFor reason magazine I married same country right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe next time a nominee to the Supreme Court is presented to members of the Senate the Senate needs to act in a more civil fashion so says calling Hannah of let freedom ring

Trump's domination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court was bound to be ideologically controversial because it would create a generally conservative five to four majority for what I Would argue is the first time since FDR if not before\nI expected that their primary ideological issue would be abortion and whether she would tilt the balance of the court away from the constitutionally liberal articulation of a right to privacy that permits most abortions too are constitutionally conservative interpretation\nThat the documents simply cannot be stretched to the point of either permitting were prohibiting abortions\nI expected some charges of mythology and ingrained prejudice against women and I felt that the makeup of the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee eleven white males many of whom or rather shall we say senior would be used as a case in point by the other side\nBut I never thought that the process would descend the level of embarrassing spectacle that it did no matter the outcome the Senate and by extension our entire Republican form of government\nHas been sell it by the emotionally charged accusations of sexual misconduct and irresponsible drinking and the equally emotionally charged defenses of judge Kavanaugh\nThe self righteous posturing and preening on both sides of the aisle and the casual discussion of improprieties has made CSPAN X. rated\nThe Senate likes to call itself the world's greatest deliberative body well it certainly was not that over the past couple of weeks\nIt was more like a locker room or a late night bar vending session the me too movement has properly awakened to many Americans to the plight of victims of sexual misconduct especially rape and attempted rape it is completely understandable that victims were repressed their memories of such incidents and be fearful of disclosing details\nHowever that new willingness to give the benefit of doubt victims cannot extend to the point of ignoring relative facts and testimonies there are many cases of false accusations even if they constitute the minority of all accusations of sexual misconduct for instance\nThere are too many African American men convicted and jailed after having been accused of rape or attempted rape if white women where in fact the accusation was ill founded\nOne of the most well known of these is the case of high school football star Brian Banks\nWas falsely accused convicted in serving time in prison with his accuser finally admitted to fabricating the entire claim we will probably never know what really happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine lousy or at Yale a few years later but\nWe are looking at the judicial record of a lawyer and judge who's conduct has never wants to my knowledge been subject to question or a scandal in the many years that he is practice law or served on the bench\nYet his adolescent conduct\nMay have been reprehensible and should not be dismissed lightly but it's not the students to read cabinet of over a quarter century ago who was nominated if the judge Brett Kavanaugh the DC circuit court\nThe wants in disregard of his judicial record by those who opposed him on ideological grounds but don't have the courage or elect to challenge him on his record shows the world\nThat we base our ideals by a car bomb best\nI voted for President Trump and I support his nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nBut I cringe when I hear him mock doctor for I think judge Kavanaugh has what it takes to be a good justice of our Supreme Court but I cringe when he allows himself to make snide remarks to a senator who was the daughter of an alcoholic or when he descends into partisan comments about is that users\nDo you listeners of American radio journal feel the same way do you feel the need for a shower after watching some of our senators\nAre you tired of political arguments that have little to do with the subject being discussed and are really all about acquiring are holding on to political power\nAnd the parents of his victims in the same room you\nCan't totally transcend yourself the only one way to arrive at it it's a semi transcendence you are able to get out of yourself to a certain degree we are able to make meaningful judgments about reality I was speaking at Johns Hopkins\nAnd just before I spoke it was a team that was given to us on what does it mean to be human and I was the jelly called voice than most of the others were from different ideologies and philosophies and so on before me Francis Collins spoke\nThe co author of the human genome project Francis Collins I'm not comfortable with this cosmology but he's a follower of Jesus Christ\nBut Francis Collins in the closing moments with his dog did something absolutely astounding and I wish I brought the picture because you've sent it to me when I asked him for it he put up on the screen and the left side a picture of a stained glass window from ... beautiful\nAbsolutely beautiful colors Joe metric proportions perfect\nAnd then he uncovered the right side and something even most spectacularly said you know what you're looking at now you said you're looking at a vertical section of the human DNA audience went [noise] you know what it dawned\nOn me we were looking at that because of which we were able to look at it to beaver\nAwed by that because of which we had the capacity to have all we were overwhelmed by a reality that people are looking at an intricate design\nFar greater than the design of stained glass window and that semi transcendence allows you to stand back and say when I see the heavens the work of your hands the stars the moon that you have made what is there in men that you are mindful of him\nAnd that you should keep him in my view or the apex of his creation\n... the glory and the shame of the universe locked into your capacity and my and so as I bring this to a close I Want to tell you what I think is really happening here\nI don't think the problem of humanity is as much the ... of evil as much as the fearful and that's a good\nThink about that\nCs Lewis in her lender talks

you at the end of my time gone let me put these two stories together and I'll bring that was ... back to\nWhen I was writing this book I interviewed several people\nOne of them as a man who went to a very legalistic Christian college\nSaid I found out after the first year that the reason they wanted people like me there's because they didn't want us to think for ourselves they told us how to think they told us what to think somebody's brain he got big successful businessmen so I just sat and listened and listened for about forty five minutes he said the whole thing is in court and the whole thing is rational I mentioned him to the other day [noise]\nAnd then I said All right tell me what do you believe about right and wrong then because I said you moved from a world where evil was a problem to a world where there's no such thing as evil I said that's unimaginable to me but let's suppose you're okay with that I said what\nYou believe he said well I'm a libertarian and my political tearing I sort of undecided libertarianism to have only one lawyer\nIn my political tearing I sort of undecided libertarianism to have only one law he said that's right I said would you repeat that law for me he said yes he said you do not be the initiate or or fraud or violence\nSo if you don't need any more than that I said tell me about your wife so did you major in college married Darnah yup fell in love with the sushi a follower of Christ you when you married or did you tell are you a struggling with your faith\nYou know she didn't tell her that\nI said in that amazing you had only one role and you couldn't keep it [noise]\nI didn't say that rudely naturally the idea [noise]\nYou know what he sat there dumbfounded said doesn't feel good does it to initiate fraud and that's the only can you preach\nAnother story I was in India\nIs writing the last few chapters of this book and I asked if I could see this woman somebody told me about her she had dinner with her on a two other sitting on the table\nAnd she told me her story I said I've heard about it you could tell me about it [noise] and uh she was a young gal looking at a hotel a five star hotel prior to that fell in love with a young Indian guy and wanted to marry him but he came from a lower cost so parents said oh no way\nNo way she pleaded and beg he played in Baghdad both parents next to John marrying somebody from a different cost so they looked and got married and their parents both of their parents\nDisown them she was left all alone from our side he was left all alone from his side she got this job and a five star hotel a few hundred miles away and went to work while she was working their way from her husband for several weeks and months at a time\nAnd I love with somebody else\nAnd the letters became fewer and far between telephone calls selling them\nHe began to worry about this because everything was okay\nAnd uh finally he took a train and went down because he was afraid he was not sharing from his wife and she admitted that there was somebody else in her life\nAnd he saw this hot out he said you know we only have each other left in this world my parents have disowned me up on some disarming you'll rejected me please don't do this he pleaded and beg but she was determined\nYou went out of the room came back a few minutes later and he said to her you know I really love you I really love you I Love to just lie down with you for half an hour and then leave but I Know you won't let me he said would you allow me to just put my head on your lap\nFor thirty minutes\nI Love you so much I just wanted to feel your presence\nAnd I promise you I'll never bother you and yet I promise you said I won't even touch you just let me put my head on your lap for thirty minutes and then

existence and how we maintain our principles into that in we're going to be discussing today federal is number Seventy eight the judiciary department and it was written by Hamilton\nIt by Alexander Hamilton yes indeed the man who was so well served by Aaron Burr yes indeed well\nThe the man who was so well served by Aaron Burr yes indeed well\nHamilton was a brilliant writer he really was I mean this guy if we could measure as IQ maybe they could go back and do it it was definitely off the charts\nBut he wrote federal is Seventy eight all the way through number eighty two and all of those Federalist Papers had to do with the role of the judiciary Seventy eight is really a meaty Federalist Papers so I recommend all your listeners go and read this\nAnd get what the founders had in mind when they established the judicial branch and how they wanted the Supreme Court and less records to function\nThey refer to them as inferior core\nInferior or to so we're gonna mostly talked about federal was Seventy eight we will get into a little bit of the constitution article three and so we're going to read and comment ... okay so towards the beginning the second sentence of the federal was Seventy eight\nHamilton says in unfolding the defects of the existing confederation and we have to remember that we were under articles of confederation which really weren't working and there were three branches of government\nWe were just run really by a unit camera Congress\nAnd he continues the utility in assessing every federal jurisdiction ... may have been clearly pointed out it is the less necessary to re capitulate the considerations their urge\nAs the propriety of the institution in the abstract is not disputed so he's saying let's not go over the need\nFor a judicial branch we know we need it we haven't had it at the national level and because we haven't had it there's been disputes amongst the states and we don't know how they're going to be solved so we've got to have some type of national judicial branch he continues third paragraph\nThe manner of constitute ing it seems to embrace the several objects first the mode of appointing the judges ... so this was number one how are we going to appoint the judges\nAnd they wrestle back and forth and you can see if you go back and read Madison's notes on the constitutional convention they arm wrestled over how were they going to appoint judges and it'll compromised on this\nAnd you know his next sentences just telling about this go ahead and says the process by which we shall do this is to drag them through the mud through sexual ...\nI mean right there yeah Seventy editors I guess okay we're so they can fake news they're saying we're going to get accused of El Al of course\nActually the next sentence says so that was number one is the mode of appointing judges and they took a while to get to that they argued in the constitutional convention should they be voted on\n... you know should the president have just the absolute right to appoint who he wants you know should we get one of the other branches involved and they went through these things and and should they have to be up for reelection once appointed and they finally settled on okay they're going to be appointed with\nAdvice and consent from the Senate and it's going to be a lifetime yeah\nFor the second says the ten year by which they are to hold their place actually and third the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts and their relations to each other which is of a fascinating unimportant the whole topic in of itself but she wanted to continue on\nAbsolutely so he continues first as to the motive appointing judges this is the same with that of appointing the officers of the union in general and has been so fully discussed in the two last numbers that nothing can be said here which would not be useless repetition\nIn other words federal is Seventy six Seventy seven short talking about right\nPrior federal is that right already discussed how other officers id his cabinet and other officers are going to be appointed and they've adopted similar routines to have judges appointed so he continues\nThe standard of good behavior for the continuing to an office of the judicial magic ... is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government\nIn a monarchy is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince interrupt public it is no less an excellent barrier to the encroachment and the impressions of the representative body and it is the best expedient which can be divide in any government\nTo secure a steady upright an impartial administration of the laws\nOkay so in other words as long as they're in good behavior what is that good behavior me\nAs long as they're in good behavior that the king can't kick 'em off in a parliamentary system right now that this is a way but in our system he's saying it's just as good the the problem is is the founders you know let's go let's take a little bit of history no Supreme Court justice\nTo this day has been impeached and\nFound and convicted and convicted right by the Senate now we've had one Supreme Court justice impeach right Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh five right\nAnd he probably deserved to be impeached because he was a federal is not that just that was an impeachable case\nBut he really was pro federal is he was a disciple of John Adams who was really pro alien and sedition acts and so Samuel Chase went out there in aggressively pursued those who were just\nThere is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislature and executive powers right and it proves in the last place that has liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone\nBut would have everything to fear from its union with either of the other departments that has all the effects of such a union must ensue from the dependence of the former on the ladder not withstanding a nominal in a parents' separation that as from the natural feeble most of the judiciary\nOkay so Hamilton did have some insight who did have some foresight then this is the way to\nDo the judicial branch could run away and basically he saying look if there is a combination between the judicial an executive or the judicial and the\nLegislative branch is that it couldn't run away and what we've seen I think is not necessarily an intentional\nCombination are plotting between the two but because a vacuum has ensued because the legislative branch has not been willing to do its duty intentionally because people are too scared to stand up to the heart issues of the day the judicial branch has moved in\nAnd in effect that's collusion to me\nI disagree okay I think that the the judicial branch starting around the time of the Roosevelt administration began to grant deference to the acts of government as the default position that government was due deference that's called the Chevron deference okay and\nIn Arizona seven moves to actually legislate that deference to the government positions in terms of a hearing between a government agency in a private citizen\nThere had been moves made in Arizona and in a bill that the governor juicy signed this year that eliminated that difference and I think what they're angling to do is eventually from the state level on up there trying to change the default setting on liberty\nFrom deferring to the government point of view or the government interpretation of a law\nTo defaulting to a neutral position where neither the government nor the private citizen or group of citizens have any greater power\nAnd I think if we could get back to that original idea on which the country was founded I think and move the court away from deference to the to the government's point of view I think that that ... to the extent we do that to that extent we preserve liberty well you do\nBring up a great point and I think it might be a combination of both\n... if you remember we went over Hernandez so does\nBook a couple of months back actually with Israel happen we talked about it okay we didn't hokey I thought we did a less than ... you may have done a lesson but not on the radio OK well Hernandez Soto basically said\nThat some of these countries that are free have a hard time with capitalism because the courts do show deference\nTo the government rather than the freedom of the people\nThat and then there's no system like a a a system for recording property property and you can't foreign capital unless you can have clear titled or something on what you can borrow money\nAbsolutely and we need to remember I mean in the declaration of independence wide governments are establishes you know how they're established to protect our inalienable rights and when we lose sight of that we lose our liberties and so I think you do\nA good point there you know it's interesting how the stated purpose of government is echoed in the state constitutions in every single state constitution has some form of a statement as to the purpose of government and that it is that all powers inherit and the people and the purpose of government is to protect the liberties\nAnd yet it seems to me such a conundrum in that the founding documents of every state our indirect Contra version with the way the courts interpret law\nThat the default setting is to accept the propriety of government regulation or government opinion on what laws well why do you think that is though\nYou know government opinion on what laws well and why do you think that is though because it hasn't happened overnight or no this is taken time no because all power wants to concentrate itself into the greatest amount and the most efficacious use of power in other words\nAll government wants to gather power to the center\nAnd that's the reason for separation of powers what's so that all government wouldn't gather power it to the center it would be distributed to the branches of government and because they had competing interests they would pull away from the center and keep power separated that hasn't happened today\nWell it's not happening because we're becoming more of a national government rather than a federal government and one of Hamilton's arguments hears the brilliance\nOf the founding documents which really is brilliant if we keep to the letter and spirit of the law which in the judicial branch is is that the\nFederal judiciary is Supreme only on those limited issues that it is delegated within the confines of our constitution\nIn our book if you can keep a republic if you can keep it Elizabeth Powell was told that by Benjamin Franklin right after the constitutional convention\nSo let's continue with federalist seven eight there is no position which depends on clear principles and that every act of a delegated the forty contracted the tenor of the commission under which is exercise is Boyd\nK let's read that again there is no position which depends on clear principles that that every act of a delegated the forty contrary to the tenor of the commission under which he does exercise this boy okay a lot of people think that judicial review\nThat the judicial branch is ability to review laws from Congress started with Marbury versus Madison that is not true it is very clear in federal uh Seventy eight\nThat one of the prime purposes for having a Supreme Court was to also keep the legislative branch in check that if the legislative branch was trying to pass laws that affected citizens of the states\nAnd the state's themselves that they didn't have power or sovereign jurisdiction over that you do this year he was supposed to be a protector of our liberties\nAnd so if you read much of it up Seventy eight it gets into a lot of this\nHamilton continues it is far more rational to suppose that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order among other things to keep the ladder within its limits assigned to their authority so that we just talked about\nA constitution is in fact in must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental wall\nIf there should happen to be an ear reconcilable variance between the two that which was superior obligation and validity or of course to be preferred or in other words and this is really important to today's discussion\nThe constitution ought to be preferred to the statue yes the intention of the people to the intention of their agents\nIn other words the intention of the people is the constitution because it was ratified by the people in the states and that is our foundational in fundamental wall and if a law passed by Congress is contrary to the people\nThe intermediary is supposed to be the judicial branch and the judicial branch is supposed to show deference to the people yeah which is the opposite of what is true\nNew to it right and so the government remains serving not master on that note that's all the time we have\nThanks for having me we're going to continue with some of the more we ever [laughter] in liberty I'm Charles how\nYou've been listening to

judge will somehow be a partisan or not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered if he's been accused of multiple crimes\nAnd he felt it was important to defend his good name and I\nI thought I thought he handled it appropriately uh there were a couple of times where I think well at one time in particular where he asked judge or senator corporate charter\nQuestion he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut uh he shouldn't be expected just to take a vis the slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and um be justified in a a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a blight some good thing because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge cabinet I I think it will be a huge mistake

were both crash cynical\nTo reach the very core of our country a country founded upon some judicial principles of due process but it's still the best of times\nThese principles like the presumption of innocence for at risk here\nI turned to a strategic voice in the Senate that as senator Joni Ernst of Iowa\nWhat have you been hearing well I Am hearing of course a mixture of that cause I get at the office a lot of them are are saying get Kavanaugh\nFirearms and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out and about as people just can't understand why we haven't moved on with\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right credentials\nTo sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done down\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story and political that you had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way she never actually said that herself but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph they'd never discuss sexual assault\nThere was a new real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows it was not about claustrophobia but its second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report\nI simply do not believe that that testimony could not Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do\nHonestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point and so do I so do I I I think most folks would agree with that However I'm even a witness says that she called forward\nActually at camp corroborate or simply hair down that that testimony that she gave about\nUm uh some party that she had to attend to add so unfortunately for her I don't\nFind that can be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think Shakespeare and trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters taught me they're telling the fourteen year old they will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up\nTo a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse who's allegation was libel was slanderous and immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge Kavanaugh on
