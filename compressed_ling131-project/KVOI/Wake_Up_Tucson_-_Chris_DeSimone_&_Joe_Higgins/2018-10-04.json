I'd gotten to read\nProbably more than most people because I'm On the committee but I still haven't gotten the final drafted details because we're also trying to figure out some there's some unusual mechanisms or Canada\nIs going to have some slightly different rules than Mexico\nUm remember one of our big frustrations with something they called the minute right um I can send any product from Canada or Mexico in the United states and if it's eight hundred dollars or less it just raises right through customs\nBut as I Know but it isn't as they fill up whatever you see in the deal unless it's really crazy isn't is still a positive for Arizona What you've seen in the\nAbility is positive for Arizona which are hoping they'll eat is are there some tweaks um that we can continue to do that are good for those those here in the southwest and that's everything it may not be in in this rewrite a great deal\nIt may be in at the things that may be some customs agreements it may be in resources for being able to examine and um move products quicker so so there's there's sort of on site cars that may be also coming when we once we actually had to sell the mechanisms within the agreement\nSo I'm looking at you know back to be good economic news that just keeps kind of role when I Know the I was on was that we had Grover Norquist on yesterday and we're going over some of the GDP mouse stuff of course which is it for as of October first\nRight is it for for one maybe for one I Apologize\nI no no don't mean to you know over one tenth but you saw unemployment is worth\nSo when I'm looking at is the story about women unemployment Weaver because we've talked about African American unemployment a Hispanic unemployment so now women on ...\nBlaming a Hispanic an employment so now women unemployment female unemployment is that a fifty year low ... of three point nine and a half the rate that it was during Obama's second term it's the lowest level in sixty five years\nGet in Sandy underlying number is even better than that\nUm if you can actually break down and see it turns out I'm living in our society are truly becoming the entrepreneurial engines of small business so take a look if you can find the number that talk about the number of small businesses\nWeighing new concerns things started by women um is just the last couple of years there's just been this I'm real spike\nSo that's actually really hopeful because it's still small businesses that often creating the next wave of employment\nRight and that's something that we see here locally I mean when I when I'm interviewing small business owners restaurant owners are meeting a lot of them that are run and owned by women\nYep yep and you know um we're in a really healthy environment for access to credit\nYou know um there's just there's a lot that now also with technology and other things there's even alternative platforms to be able to finance the starting of your business um you know historic barriers are gone\nUm that there's and the ability to start a small business with technology and the deal with the bell that your phone can be your inventory management in your book keeper and those things um there's actually a lot of excitement of we're seeing um people that\nAre just a few years ago would have probably been fearful to go out on the run and start a business or doing it\nSo you know the uh the the good folks at score you know the retired executives that help people with their business here so they have their stats on women\nA this is the this past summer and they said first of all that women are are slightly more likely than men now to start businesses forty seven forty four percent women are more likely to launch businesses in both health care and education\nThey say that fifty seven percent of women business owners expect their revenues to increase in two thousand Eighteen or and then ah just two percent of women expect revenues to decrease by more than twenty percent in the next twelve month\nBut think that will you got to get your head around is how different debt that those numbers are ... even just a couple of years ago so look I'm the theme continued good things are happening in our economy I'm at my wife has a theory that all the\nStupidity and the chaos and the noise you know whether it be a Supreme Court houses are fighting over something in some ways\nI'm is wonderful because it keeps Congress from sticking their nose into things that are actually working in the society and keeps the median everyone else distracted\nThe uh so so I was talking to a ... a Grover yesterday about first of all we started talking about\nA tax points to point out you know of course that's something that's you know that's what he's working on a lot of times um\nIn relation to all again I we keep saying ... is this is the story of good news that we just talk is it going to get to the voter that's my biggest concern I [noise]\nIt's it it's hard from the standpoint of if there's someone that right now listening to one of the other stations not that they anyone would ever do that correct in in your community what are the hearing\n'em if they woke up this morning and put on CNN or MSNBC or NBC they just they they they had an avalanche of just being hounded All right\nI'm In less you're someone right now listening to either station like we're on at this moment or maybe even one of the the Bloomberg the financial\nUm they get an a a story of hey we've almost never lived in a time where the current economy is this Dave All right um [noise] do do you go out and vote because early ballots route and what six days yeah\nUm where do you get your ballot and will you nailed that I'm On the last pitch a motion or would you actually wrote to protect your family and your community um by trying to walk in this economic growth and and I don't know the whole it was all over the place right now\nListen to your wife called mission

Sunday night only ten percent do for Columbus Day Monday with about Seventy five percent humidity right now we're still right around Seventy degrees in the valley of am ten thirty\nNow they face the point that [noise]\nYou know\n\nThat is a great\nWhile while\nEleanor Ricky ... [noise]\nYou know you don't ever have to say you were there [noise]\n... [noise]\nLovely arrangement and\nShe's always amazing that's a hell of an arrangement [noise]\n[noise]\nAll right we've got to jump back in the chamber endorsed important part of the show because of the show for years because we've been talking about business leadership right\nAnd if you're going to run the Tucson chamber and you're going to make your the big dog in this town you got to do things right you're going to actually advocate for your businesses that kind of thing so that's where my criticism comes up from All right and you can't do things in a bubble expect me to know about it and go well we're doing this or how would I Know that right\nRight and you know\nI like amber a lot she's getting ready to come on the show and\nIf you're going to run that chamber you got to learn how to have a little bit of a thick skin also\nThat's just what it is I mean you're making six figures for you that's part of it\nNow uh one of my business owners who has a business with multiple employees asked me this question about the chamber how does the chamber get paid as a public or private now I Would\nSay that Ninety nine percent of their money comes from do sponsorships and whatever all private of that Ninety nine the only thing unless they changed the deal which is possible and then ... tell me when she comes on hopefully soon and the next thirty days\nForever the city of Tucson owns that building on St Mary's and remember that the city of Tucson building and they're on the dollar rent deal for the year\nSo unless that's change something Varney or amber renegotiated and then they bought the building I don't know\nUm but um so I Would say the public money\nOne of the reasons why I'm the metro chamber might be worth a little extra criticism from taxpayers is that that deal is still in existence\nThen the taxpayer is subsidizing the Tucson metro chambers wrecked\nSo if you tell me what the market rent is for a building on a commercial corner on St Mary's been Granada I Know that number is\nSo let's say it's two thousand a month don't know if that number is accurate but let's call it two thousand a month for the building\nAnd they're paying a dollar a year lease you may be subsidizing the chamber twenty three plus thousand dollars and the and the people at the council might tell you we want to have a chamber that double blessed so that's why we do it but\nWe want to have a chamber that double blah so that's why we do it but if that deal still going and you're and you end the tax payer of Tucson is subsidizing the chamber's rent by only charging them to the dollar then actually believe it or not I know no one at the chamber board wants to hear this the taxpayer\nDoes have a little bit of things to say about what they do over there\n\nBecause you're subsidizing there right now ... tells me different or one of their board members that they bought the building than that\nUm that doesn't exist anymore that dynamic hunting on to you as the is some of you will say it's a problem with some of you say I say what might have happened\nLet's let's let's put it looks what a good shine on this that hurt board at the chamber said let's go without a leader\n'cause that's what they did four years ago\nAnd they caught hell for not just from\nUs but a lot of people remember a a few months before that all of a sudden H. T. Sanchez buys a membership and the chamber for five thousand dollars then all of a sudden metal either get say endorsement per member that whole kerfuffle\nSo maybe they're bored or some cooler heads prevailed and said let's not even touch that right now the reason why it's a possible it's a problem a little bit\nIs that if there's two things to change to make life better in Tucson for business owners especially since the chamber with the ... the kids and everything I've said education is so important educated at at this earlier educated workforce educated workforce educated workforce\nNow and I always ask you about your press releases right how many press releases you get from business groups talking about how important education is right yeah I'll get a lot yeah yeah most of them from Phoenix but yet but this is a big thing with the business community education education education is even the losers a trio talk about education\nCatching though right so when you have the biggest school district\nActually some of made the point that now they're losing so many kids do you as the now the third largest in the state hey go Chandler is now bigger than the u._s. date is what they were saying well if the check those numbers out but if you're going to say education an educated workforce is so important\nChanging to USD to get to do some sort of change\nProbably pretty important so let's do this let's go visit some of our great sponsors when I come back we'll go through some of their endorsements some of them are good I Would have cold enough not back on their endorsements

IRA that is from the national Institute on retirement security so fifty nine percent of working age Americans have zero accumulated assets in a retirement account\nSo when we talk about all of this economic um goodness going on right now [laughter] right\nIn the end one of the things that will jeopardize it is these stagnant dynamics of saving money putting a little money aside\nIn the end isn't that isn't that a\nKind of a crashing wave one day that's going to make a lot of people unhappy we haven't we haven't even gotten to the student loan bubble but that's a whole other story\nWell we do a great job the last ten years is sweeping everything under the rug and that's why it's so amazing people that really bright people and they look at how well\nA stock market has done over ten years they say well what happened to this and what happened to that and everything gets swept under the rug the United states keeps sweeping the budget under the rug how many phony um\nExtensions can we possibly give a budget right you know and nobody really wants to address it a nobody really wants to do you want to Mr this in the ring nobody really wants to address Social Security and Medicare\nWhich you talk about there's real wealth real wealth and their because\nEvery working person whether they saved or not money was pulled out of their check and their employer had to match it right so how many trillions of dollars are in Social Security that we keep hearing is in jeopardy will be bankrupt in Twenty years or instead of sixty\nFive new return they can be eighty five you know [laughter] so this stuff he's getting swept\nUnder the rug well people are to where you know up all just came up with this new roads [laughter] critical quotable good camera going forward and they have a hundred and Seventy five billion in\nCash and they went a thousand dollars for the phone so you put your money there\nRight right instead of investing your butt in the phone so I have flown so this is your world this is your world now if really Social Security ... if if the government had any respect for the American people would have went to like um New York life and bought an annuity\nAnd maybe we would have made say on average we would have made five percent in in in a regular annuity that these things you hear on the seminars or the guy on Fox News op down sideways just an old fashioned straight\nUp you know simple things you'd have\nInstead of instead of celebrating that you know maybe you'll get Fifteen hundred or two thousand a month depending on how many quarters you put in how do you like to get six seven thousand dollars a month a thousand a month from Social Security\nYou put it in at five percent you know you probably would have been more like in that ballpark but because the government keeps ... you know it it still stole the money\nCan can you you and I rarely agree with Al Gore All right well let's go back to the Gore Bush debate let's go back member the lock box\nThe lot fun it was awesome yes that's what I'm that's what are the new it is it's a lock box you can't Congress you can steal people's retirements you know these since you think oh well the fees you know they're worried I Lived with Warren is worried about the fees on a on a index fund\nThat's peanuts I Want to know where my money isn't Social Security and so should you associate you any new Republican candidates if you're\nYou're out here for election day I Hope no Republican candidate is stupid enough to talk about cutting Social Security or Medicare right because that does aggravate me 'cause you've stolen from me enough now don't cut back after you have stolen from me now that is a\nTrue Lyme okay what you just said because you're right with all of their dickering on these fees and different things like that right [laughter]\nOkay so the idea that they did that\nAnd then at the same time they've abused your your Social Security money as their own personal slush fund for whatever they're doing\nYou know you're up that's where you're at\nComplete disregard in complete disregard for Medicare's no ... look at the people in your ear out there you're listening to this you're still paying a premium to be in Medicare\nIt comes out of your check right and then to add a little salt to the wound\nYou have to have the Medicare supplement and the only reason why people are not screaming murder in this country is because under Bush they came out with the advantage plan where you basically assign your Medicare rights to\nUh the company and they're they're kind of managing it that way so people over sixty five might be paying sixty five a month\nMy my one thing on my ... admonition on Medicare of course is the idea that if you look at the numbers that\nSomeone pay them over their life to what the average payout is there's a pretty good disparity in relation\nTo what's on the back end okay and part part of it is a lot of those we've talked about a lot of times on this show that those end of days that last month of somebody's life\nRight where they're at the hospital and intensive care and they want to keep them alive for twenty eight days and it's ten thousand dollars a day or all that there's a lot of problems there are we've been talking to a lot of these um hospice\nThis book that uh we're talking about today\nIt's it's not a I'm In my opinion it's not as much or you know for one thing you know people like they drink the Kool Aid and and they get on the thing there's only one answer and this is the ... this is the only answer right it's just basically looking at the IRA in a broad perspective that\nPeople really have not\nDone a good job accounting for the tax liability on the distributions\nFrom sixty five to say age Ninety sixty five to eighty five and then the taxation to their children in the next generation so they become in most cases cannon fodder\nFor us for them absolute cannon fodder to to to to liquidate okay the way the distribution is set up for the R. M. D. right\nThat is just a nice way of saying we're beginning to liquidate your annuity on our church and\nWe got to use English are MD is not a new way of group from the eighties that's required minimum distribution okay required minimum distribution very good so what what let's talk about that for a second All right so now one more thing before I get to that I'm going to do well to put in certain one more thing here\nWhat happened since the great recession is a lot of companies and a lot of governments if you work for them well not the government sorry that I Do a lot of companies mostly some governments\nTook you off of the defined benefit\nWhich means if you make so much and you work so many years you get this payment now they're taking people who used to be on that and there are new hires and they're putting you more and more on four O. one K. is an IRA kind of stuff purchased plans so there's a bigger percentage of the population that\nNeeds to understand this more than ever so that's why this was important even and this was not a discussion just for people who are sixteen over\nThis is for people while you're doing that you need to understand how this game is played so you can first of all if you if you there are certain things that if you don't do it at the right time or in the white right way you are going to leave money on the table that you shouldn't have been the first place\nAnd that's a big problem here because all of that growth right all that money that came out of your paycheck any good great that you got back on benefits if you're just going to hand it back to the IRS 'cause you're not paying attention that's a step backwards\nIt's very well said Christ you know in all the material in advertising for financial services and they give you a laundry list of disclosures\nWhat we're looking at even for the person who's forty or fifty years old that's putting money in a four O. one K. or money purchase plan as opposed to the defined benefit plan right you have to realize\nThey have no clue the substantial\nThey have no clue the substantial tax liability these fees you know oh it's only a half a point or it's a point they have no clue on the back and so between fees inflation and taxation\n\nIt's going to it is going to create real undertow real headwind\nAgainst your Irish so when you're taking a distribution you're not getting what you think you're getting and you know we're using assumptions now the stock market's going to go up Fifteen Percent a year forever which is not a likely I was the main thing but\n... what would it be at five six percent of steady growth on a more conservative valuation\nAnd the numbers are scary\nLet's go to the phones seven nine zero two zero four zero let's go to Kevin online to Kevin around the ... brothers with a gag order to\nYou Chris Kevin I'm quick question for you Joe a year if you had money in a tax deferred account like a four one K. account and your past retirement age what would be the disadvantage of taking that chicken a large chunk somebody they're\nPaying the tax on it and then put it in a runoff IRA okay well fiery deferred for like a long long there's no taxes on the rough it's another word data that Chechnya now be done with it\nBut then it's ... for distribution for life you have to that is that correct or now and can you tell me why you would tell me not to do that to take their money out of your four o one K ... and then rolled into a lot to Charlie get set up\nYou know it it seems to be one of those great ideas that not enough people really do have to put pen to paper you have to you know you're going to pay out quite a bit of tax\nThirty percent right or twenty percent whatever it is Twenty one percent right\nNow I'm the last you got an and the value of money at a certain interest rate and so we don't you know ... and under the amount you know if it's twenty five thousand is different and if it's two hundred and fifty thousand\nOkay she'll based on what we all know that the situation right now nobody's going to assume that catches your going to be going down anytime the future would it be better to check their hair cut at Twenty one for whatever you get to the Twenty one percent tax rate right now\nI'm just take the haircut assuming down the road that the rates are going to be higher you you're going to pay the tax but you're just going to pay it up\nFor seven at Twenty one percent is on the on the yellow sea corporate ... OK okay than\nAny you know we're not quite there on the individual but besides that I Would have to sit down with the person and look at the numbers projecting numbers out in theory\nWhat'd you say sounds wonderful yeah and practicality there's a lot of pitfalls and actually Kevin thank you for bringing the question because in the top ten IRA mistakes book these are the kinds of things we look at\nAnd when we do planning with people we look at the big picture and we kind of figure out the numbers\nWhat's the cost of making a decision and where do we want to go\nOkay that that was like right so\nIt Kevin you want to leave your number with that and I can have just set up a cup of coffee ... as I\nWill do that you have to forgive me mark Kenny or I didn't see that uh there's another person that I'm working with right but I I Want to talk to you about it so I Will get my number out I'll call it that give him my number and we will sit down and let you get your opinion on advocate\nFor touching a touch a great\nYeah a lot of people ask for a second opinion since no problem\nOkay they're trying to do All right I I Will I get your number here and you know Chris knows where I live in a new favorite movie ... yeah I Know he doesn't he doesn't drop which on my feet anymore doubt the club [laughter] every movie guy lived in my backyard so I'll make sure you will hear from me Joe I promise you okay\nI get your at your leisure my friend I'm I'm not going anywhere [laughter] morning\nShit you guys have a good day or a week I'm back let's let's let's do this RMC thing real quick and one of the first ones is what can happen to you if you don't take it when you're supposed to\nOh the well the ominous penalty your CPA vote flag hold that thought\nEight forty six in the morning Jody ... if you'd like a copy of this book top ten IRA mistakes by David Roy or\nDo some ... planning is giving them away as a a ... as while supplies last give Joe a call at ... at eight to zero three zero five eight to get a great book and Alexander spinach ... when he plays the last time everyone went crazy listener Martin one of the loop wake up [noise]\n\n[noise]\nTalk to\nMe it goes ... ... ... lives too\nSoon to know\nWho's who I'm due to\n... to\n\n...\nWho's\n... um\n...\nRemover\nTerm or ...\n\n\nThe historic award winning hostility del sol guess ranch resort is the place to be to experience the golden age of Hollywood on Sunday October the twenty eight featuring Tom musical entertainers redefining yesterday social tradition called the ... were calling her yard as part of the performance\nMake plans for Sunday October twenty eight to hear the Manhattan do sing their way through the memorable Nineteen twenties to the sixty mining ... club dancing dinner for show called nine zero one one three four two on line and ...\nEven the very worried abortion cancer a strong emotion winery thing is because it's become so politicized at hand of hope she's kind of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson - Chris DeSimone & Joe Higgins", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "04"}
