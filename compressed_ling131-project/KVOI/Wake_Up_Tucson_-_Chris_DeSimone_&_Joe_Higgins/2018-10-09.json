in this week engagement explaining how we got here um let's talk about mandated services\nOh yeah what will first okay let me just say that if you look at the corps of engineers ... study in ... where it goes for the there's\nAlways this started long before the financial crisis long before the the you know the wage states sweeps we're such a big problem et cetera you can't you can't get all the Seventy percent of our roads and poorer failed condition even by going back to O. nine\nIt just can't happen if you're maintain them you have to go back long before that in ... maintain them in and Thirteen Years later I mean some of them may have been already down to a very good but at some point way before then you had to stop maintained\nWell we've talked about the ... the state money when talking about sleeps right or not the sweep the word sweet so disingenuous strike because they make it sound like they got they got zero it out\nThey they took all of our money and and the and actually again you know a quote from the a memo from the county administrator you end up if they stop the sweeps right now\nI'm the Hearst diversion is they call it the whole region would get an extra weapon point three million well this isn't twenty sixteen it's probably well I don't I don't have the\nHigher now yeah I mean well did it I'm a little better yeah so ... well that is\nSo anyhow the diversion he says for the whole region will be eleven point three million and the county would gain an extra three point six million a year [laughter] as compared to a county budget at one point three billion witch's point a three percent\nOf the county budget and also as compared to like I said we've had a two hundred million dollar failure it just the last three years\nReal quick yeah so what Chuck said in his own memo yeah\nApril Twenty one twenty sixteen that if the if they if this he didn't say the word sweep and this was only when they're in the media did they say I don't like it took everything in writing right aides say the word diversion but if you stop the diversion the amount of money the county would get\nOn a year for unincorporated right is three million three point six alright ... where one point three billion dollar budget county right so we've already figured this out you said point point three percent of the of the budget so one third of one percent of the budget you'd have to find in the budget\nAnd this is the example I made the last year here we said oh Gary I'm gonna let you go you need to take a pay cut are going to fire\nRight and you would say well how much is my pay cut honest I\nPoint three one third of one person and you're like oh okay my job right that's what we're talking about that is\nHow little of a money it is that they would have to find in the budget to quote fill the whole by these sweeps that when they go on bills shelling out to be a sweep sleep sleep sleep Mr cheap sleep sleep sleep sleep and and\nYou have other people out in the community by and that that same discussion if you've worked at the ... what I'm told is the deficit for the unincorporated Pima County remember eight sixty is for the whole counting all the region the city's et cetera I think it's something to three hundred million something\nSweet stopped it take only a hundred years to cover that that wrote deficit in unincorporated Pima County\nNow before I got to get to this thing that I think everyone doesn't realize and one of the things we got to get out today with the Gary is how this thing works really works because we're going to do that but this is my this is the next part after this this is important too so last time you hear we talked about shucks opinion on mandated services\nRight and maybe this is something to do this is a former right wing bloc yeah this is a memo he wrote oh I'm Sorry and it says general obligation bond issue for regional road repair that's a heavy now that this is June fourteenth twenty Eighteen page five okay courting subsection de ... the\nCommon belief that mandated services were more of a priority than non non mandate he's talking about the historic decide something to that I felt as a movie that's a common but wait\nAt the onset I would've liked to state I Do not agree with this philosophy is it puts in jeopardy some of the most desirable services for typical taxpayers and then he gives the example of the parks department which is I said we're eighty were less than eighty fifth and then in the nation but I think right here\nYou know he's seen a ... he disagrees kind of with the common belief that mandated services were more of a priority to non mandate\nSo you literally saying that roads growing grass and parks and paying your sheriff's deputies and supporting them or not things the typical taxpayer is desiring\nI'm just reading the historical budget discussion was always focused on mandated versus mine ... non mandated a services when discussing the county's budget with the common belief that mandated services were more of a priority than non mandate I share that common belief\nYou know whereas why their mandate [laughter]\nSo let's do this let's go to break I'm going to try to get the calls are so much stuff to get through here but what Gary is going to do and come back this is how the bond is set up right on the white where two roads get fixed and all this right you guys need to understand this is the part that you really we've already told you a lot of stuff this is you got to understand the nuts and bolts of this thing\nIt's a it's a ... it's a weird wild ride like Mr towards well right appeal\nTo me when I write Gary Davis and Christie some um [noise]\nA pinball wizard like driving around a Sony vale road\n\n\n\nOn\nA bass player for the [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWell see\nWhat the\nFifty percent of the roses are poor failed condition\nThat means sixty five percent of the roads including half of those in poorer failed condition aren't going to get touched at all because they're only doing half of them with this bond issue in this bond issue I don't know what last nine years I I don't really know now you've got some experience I Know\nThat is when you have to be on the road advisory committee I got a tire marks on my back to show a Gary now now how how do you feel\nAbout hearing this is the criteria for picking them\nSo I'm On this transportation advisory committee which has invoked in this thing we have there are some well all I Want to get to that yeah All right and so what happened was they raise the tax write they raise your taxes the fix local roads\nThis is the tax that they had to get rid of because they can shove this thing down your throat so that's why the yes on four sixty three you're going to hearing from Wendell tomorrow they gave you the biggest tax cut in history or whatever right well because they added they gave it to your two years ago right All right so then it was sold\nThat this was going to basically go to the transportation advisory committee and they were going to be able to pick the roads in each district\nThat that would get fixed we actually had a unanimous vote of the committee All right that's what I was even being outnumbered by the dams and Chuck as three appointees on it so the way this went down is when it got to the nitty gritty alright although all those unanimous votes\nThat said oh so Reggie drought my fellow appointee at the time Barney's my fellow appointee now okay we basically had four town meetings\nGreat attendance at these things right okay 'cause they're pissed off about their roads okay so we try to prioritize and the ones that were hurting the most\nAnd what happened was Chuck just wanted to use the money to spray seal and keep roads better were like me we got people suffering let's have a few windows on the board that was our take on how we we picked wrote right okay and what happened was at one seven six\nThat they rejected ours\nAccepted Steve Christie's and the oh that's just you got rejected too at the county level level will get back All right and what happened was amber Smith from the chamber Rick prize ekstrom and all those guys screwed us over\nAnd I want to give credit to two of trucks appointees which is currently wick and Tom uh the guy from ... I Can't believe I'm pleased with name McGovern who own film a civil engineering they actually voted with us and we lost seven six right instead of nine to for which I thought it was gonna\nSay you're feeling much better about this is I read it absolutely not well what I also point out that\nThe the great um\nPassover of the twenty fifth bonds where all of a sudden it the last minute all this stuff\nBasically in the central city and going way up almost or a valley all of the projects got remove right any kind of the ... bay a I'm not saying this won't work just really well so then we go to four point to\nSix of this of the ordinance and this is the annual list of roads and says on an annual basis transportation finance department will determine the\nTotal amount of bonds okay and then\nThe Transportation Department will then use the above selection criteria of that we just went over to develop a recommended annual list of roads to be treated with these revenues\nThe recommended lists will then be reviewed by the transportation advisory committee where Christians just explain what goes on there I just did if necessary\nAnd recommended and transmitted to the board of supervisors for approval to the board can change it again if they choose to\nRight now the other thing well what could happen though Steve Christie's on board with this right he's right on everyone to vote for the bomb you shouldn't be Steve\nOr is the idea that they could do the same thing we can go through the whole rigmarole of the process that the committee right then it gets even if it could get approved at the committee right then it gets to the board of soups and they screw district one again on the roads take care of the because he came out for the bombs and you gotta remember they've been screwing district one way before rally Miller\nOkay if you I mean there were some of the worst roads went and they were they're playing ball of these guys for you're right I remember district one district for you guys are the sheep they sure you to pay for other things remember that alright keep don't give me more than what the will give me the the nitty gritty of\nOkay so so then going down I'm a paragraph or point three bond proceeds are limited to construction caused directly related to pay their reconstruction that makes total sense\nNow this is something I Want all the towns to pay attention to I I Can't tell you what exactly this means but it talks about a bond play Andy being developed and says\nBut it talks about a bomb plan B being developed and says identify which roads to repair and this is the municipalities with the ... ... total share of bond proceeds over a maximum of nine years\nAnd we'll we'll come back to that once you ... I Want you guys out there in the ... to have somebody read this and decide what you think it means\nAnd then to India was supposed to be developed by the municipalities reviewed recommended by the transportation advisory committee\nAnd then in three qualifying reconstruction repairing preservation treatments types include mill and overlay structural overweight and reconstruction in other words municipalities this doesn't cover just ordinary maintenance this is like total rebuild\nSo what you're saying is the way you're reading it is that if you're a municipality takes care of the road the bond basically says that it's only for reconstruction milling paved type of job and if you don't have enough of those\nWhat happened right I I don't know and it takes Thirteen Years for them to fail and\nThere's this nine years thing in here which I don't know if that's a ... I don't know they ought to read it I don't I just\nDo before we go to break so here's the municipality people that are coming out against this bill bronco and ... is coming out against the mayor ed is not just a no but hell no again on those Steve ... Democrat from Tucson is telling you know on this right\nWell I Know Steve reads these things correct by the way\nAnd then of course Miller has been waste wrong no against us so there is a variety of elected though there are right including a Democrat and the center who's probably one of the few people over there that can read a budget and read these things in Steve's telling you this is a no\nSo seven forty five in the morning this will be made it to YouTube before lunch you to share this with all your friends and family are Gary Davis in Christie's Simone at Alexander Tony Ford from ten west and sort of Tucson come\nWe've got some [noise]\n\nWe go to song cuisine Saudi Arabia why\nThink invited me to do well you know it's a place where they are amazing aren't they fabulous we got them from budget blind and the best part oh my gosh they're motorized how can you yeah and I can't just an homage to touch them I mean my husband's may you may mind you can I had\nLike ... planes number come locally owned by the blind in Tucson at seven nine zero six twenty eight year old [noise] [noise]\nI'm John Henderson endorsing my wife on a Henderson for representative not just because they care about her because she cares so much about you\nOn a works tirelessly to be of service to our community she knows you have to understand the problem before you can also which means listening to everyone including parents teachers business owners veterans and more solving problems or something on a does well she'll make a difference for our community because she is listening and doing the real work I'm John Henderson\nVote on a Henderson for state representative paid\nFor by like ten or ... ... ... ... when\nYou were just light through the ... one of the world ... international saving Indians imported from through ... and in the middle of increasing\nDoubling government have something called me\nTo ... bin ...\nIdea of getting to the Taliban\nAnnual music plus a civil directed by me you were a composer Daniel Asia October tenth through the sixteenth presenting the music of car did you see in commemoration of the hundred years since his death\nAnd in honor of my sixties his birthday and Thirty years in residence at the University of Arizona's Redd Foxx school of music festival including a major conference is imposing and seven concerts with featured gas the ... string quartet ...

Laymon turtle once you put it on soccer you wonder about it I think as\nI Am down the hill so yeah I mean we I I Love to take you on tangents all the time um so what if you're going to sit with someone about\nMaking a pitch yeah what are the two or three things that they're having they need to work on better to be out her pitch\nMore fact of the first thing is no one cares about your personal epic narrative so\nOne day I was sitting in the office and I thought that might no one cares start with the problem and the pain right and one person so so one person's pain make it real and then blow that up to a big number and show me this one person the suffering that you know empathize with this or\nThis person who can't get a puppy yoga right there aren't puppy yoga studio this is this is Chris and he loves puppy yoga but there aren't very many opportunities and so he's miserable ... I'm now show me how many millions of other people want puppy yoga and how many billions of dollars it costs not having it in stress and Medical College where\nYou know what happened is every biography of anyone university on TV or a movie starts with you know I was born yeah and you know that's\nThat's important it's important to the person telling this story but to no one else right and you really need\nIt when I always tell folks is a you know the investor doesn't care about how you got here they care if you're solving an interesting big problem with a unique solution that has some defense ability if you can put three things together and you've got someone who pay attention to you so\nI'm I'm working on a project right now that are we talking about regenerative medicine ... and I talk about my mom having ... and I talk about people going to post operative ed\nAnd I say this affects two hundred and sixty one thousand people United States and costs us nine point two billion dollars and I can make it all go away\nWith somebody's already exist on the shelf that feels like solving pain right people suddenly set up and go oh wait a minute now that's a real problem so yeah we're teaching people to pitch which is what I've been doing for idea funding said going back to idea funding sure so one of the day's intend West is ideal funny which is the largest\nUh entrepreneurial and and venture capital as a kind of event in southern Arizona annually so it's a full day is a venture capital lunch in a which is a little bit of extra in your ticket the twenty five dollars gets you into that but the venture capital in Chicago's little bit extra and you have to are the people that they have limited space right but\nThere's a bunch of educational ... based on where you're at with your idea whether you're at idea prototype validation or growth there's a whole track of educational panels presentations and speakers on what and these are all people who've done it before\nSo they're going to tell you this is what I one of the topics that I'm a a moderating is what I Wish I knew when I started to raise money for my company\nFrom people who actually raise money\nSo if you really want to learn this quickly if you wanna get a crash course not Russia get connected the community network with all the right people and learn how to move forward idea funding is really important to be at a ... it's critical so how much extras that they're going so idea findings nothing experts including your twenty five dollars only the venture capital lunch costs extra okay\nAnd that's the easy part of the T. V. C. and it's a full day you want a box up the entire day for it\nNow I tell me about women's hack of John I just love that name yeah other than that goes on but I liked the idea that you're you know it's a woman only kind of a\nEvent that's important because if you talk to women and the tax base um what you'll hear a lot of it and then the aircraft solve this when they they created their their um their trends Pham women's night right they call it like the when the transit W T F night there's when women show up and they want a well there's always some\nGuard helped the barbarian yeah transom\nSo so do you identify\nAs female they created a night for people who identify as women right and who I went and got yourself but the goal is\nWhen we moved shop to learn to weld for example right ah there'd be some dude who would kind of flipping we teach them how to well then you know make them feel intimidated a lot of women felt right cause if you've ever worked with uh your wife or a friend's email friend it can be a little intimidating to have a bunch of guys standing around being like you know judging you while you learn some chemical thing\nHappened under the same way because it takes a lot of risk taking it a lot of failure and it's very technical and it tends to be dominated by men and a and and that's okay\nBut we need to create a space for women to experience that as well to getting involved with the women in teams and to create these really interesting technologies to take a chance every weekend to construct a prototype to break some things to do some engineering gotcha um so that's what that's that's focused on um\nNow the one I Want to get at two okay man go ahead this is the one we're ever going to go the eggs to says this is a week from Saturday at six in the morning starts well I talk I\nShut up [laughter]\nTactical urbanism yeah okay so and then this permanent real this is over on sixth and seventh avenue in seventh street so you're going to be using paint planters a community art and other animals to reclaim space for the naval heard wild also calming traffic\nI get to make walls of a tin cans\nI Love whatever you want is a great you know it's funny though if you look at look at the statistics areas that have more plants and more lights yes crime goes down a lot of it\nI agree with all that and it also does slow traffic it softens or you will slow down to see things as nor visually interesting more people goes all the time they're more people there creates less isolation which reduces criminal activity\nYou can fit you don't have to fix everything with the police response you can actually fix criminal activity in neighborhoods with the right infrastructure developing maybe a little we'll both yeah\nNow [laughter] you do you really want to go but I got I got to have I Know\nThey're going to have a street party would DJ's food trucks and more that you really want to go to this is always nice thing even\nFashion designer who focuses on\nA Nineteen seventies rock and roll classic car inspired pieces so stuff that look you've seen some of it looks like it I say a lot of them look like somebody dropped a suitcase out the back of a road east van and like Seventy four right and just in the desert\nOr it's the jak initial download is being done to ... hours a day trip I he's on line and you can find or stuff on line but I I was I was you know she's in Miley Cyrus has Warner product and it's being picked up on HBO\nSo all of his classic art from you know all these artist you loved in the seventies right she really has captured the spirit of that yes 'cause I really I I first asked you oh does she getting the ... the licensing for all these groups you know she's literally it so you're on the reading new artwork\nThat looks like it should have been at the\nCorrect merge table at a seventies concert yeah correct right very cool stuff it's really cool and and and and it's so funny to me 'cause she came to the program and she already had a lot of folks are really interested in their product but\nJust a little bit advertise a little bit digital push a little bit of support in in how to you know how to start moving\nA to expand and she had everything she ... she's one of those people are already has solve this this really interesting problems for people who wanted vintage clothes but couldn't afford to buy the really good quality vintage stuff from that period because ... very expensive right there's a lot of people out there trying to buy it and what's left is not in very good shape\nSo she just as I just started designing new vintage\nWas very clever move where does it get produced a so somebody gets produced here so it gets produced in China okay I'm you know it depends on we'll see how that all goes it's with terrorists and things like correct\nBut uh you know it comes down to it's hard to manufacture some things in the U.S it's just the costs are much lower elsewhere so um if you're going to be a global brand you have to start\nPaying attention it costs so correct I I think she would love to get more production here or in Mexico Mexico sounds like such a a good answer to this and it just depends on a hobby is all kind of shakes out you know with NAFTA trade towers and things like that but she's got a great product you should definitely check herself a\nClassic rock a tour yeah tell me and tell me about this uh ... you've been teasing have been All right some of the Bush not about your beard bomb\nNo mayor announced that that the tea to let them make yourself a set aside my started Tucson that for a second because there's something I'm doing independently with some other started because system leaders\nSo we have partner number now see it on this show the press won't hit until next week so you get out the exclusive first announcement Chris look at the sauce spoiled is I'm a spoiled guy you are we're bringing founder Institute to Tucson ... Institute is a technology accelerator\nBased in Silicon valley started by a deal recipe a debt recipe with you on mosques roommate they're still butts um and this organization is a proven program for helping people move from idea to having an actual company\nOr its three months a lot of work a but to give you some stats of how well does this work so far they have graduated thirty three hundred companies\nYou know a hundred and eighty six feet in sixty countries so far out of those\nYou know a hundred and eighty sixties in sixty countries so far out of those you know how tough it is small business going Seventy eight percent of those companies are still operating after two years wow they raised five or seven hundred million in funding for those companies and the companies have a total worse than about twenty billion dollars\nSo when does this program started in Tucson uh the first event public event for you to come in like a meet some of our mentors and learn about how to launch a start up while keeping your day job is October theory\nAnybody out there can go to ... CEO F. I. dot CEO and you'll be able to to ah get to the Tucson page register for the event and the way that this works is we don't take ideas we take founder so you actually go on line and take a entrepreneurial DNA test which is a combination of temperament personality and I do\nUm and they score you and the very best people who are stored regardless of what their ideas if they've got the right temperament to push through and become an entrepreneur right they're the ones that get the opportunity to go to the program the where's is going to take place\nSo the first event is at the Marshall building or do you have a short but there'll be ... will public events going on we're not we're not going to be doing the classes until a February March so we've got a bunch of public events uh I've got a twenty mentors in the community who are all CEOs of companies you've heard of\n'em where you know we are talking to people who are very big CEO's they're listening on the website uh Ryan George from simple view\nI'm In a more Aspen all from the ... these are the mentors in the program so this is a we're putting together I'm One of the highest caliber accelerators and the cost has really low low cost a it really runs about eight hundred bucks for three months\nPretty reasonable and the reason is uh we can do that we have sponsors and the way that this all works is when you create your company you agree to give four percent equity four percent\nBack to founder Institute one percent of that goes to the national headquarters one percent of that goes to the local leadership team one percent gets split among all of the mentors based on how helpful they wear so they're incentivized to help you\nWrite and one percent get split among all the graduates of that cohort so you all have a piece of each other's company when you graduate interesting right so that means that everybody's got an incentive in everybody else's company to move forward pretty smart so this is a this is a a big deal because\nIt's it's a proven process\nIt's something that we know works we've watched it work with other companies it's nationally supported founders used it as a lot of connections in Silicon valley it's based out of Palo Alto\nOther than your own personal force of will and contacts yeah talk about the process of landing at an having come here so\nUh started with a few started ecosystem leaders and uh since we saw these were in other cities it's reaching out to the founder Institute a having a national conversations and then in order to do this you actually have to go through a training program\nAnd more than half of the people who start that wash out and can't complete the training program to be allowed to start why that because what happens when there's a lot of homework there's a lot of things you got to follow on there's partnerships in agreement you have to create and you know\nYou're basically by failing to excel on either these tasks yeah basically they can kick you out yup\nThey won't let you start a chapter until you pass through that so uh so far off for leaders were were three weeks into the four week final of this and uh where I'd say we're Ninety five percent is that we could still wash out\nBut I think we've got which is why we don't especially\nOn next week right right um but but uh you know just to do it it's also only about thirty percent of the people who take the test get accepted and only about thirty percent of the people who start the program finish\nIts we're all your ear almost there it is a very yeah it's a ... you come in is a very rigorous program I'm not going to lie to a lot of work but\nYou will finish where they Delaware see corporation and the ability to go pitch for money and the connections to do so if you work at it structure\nSo this is the first session is going to be October thirtieth that's the first public session you have to come on out and check it out um and again you can go to find out CEO slash events you should see our event page\nUm you can read all about the founder has to get on line uh this is this ... been around for quite a while and it's really moving so every every week I'm doing global calls with leaders from all over the world and the c._e._o. or the arrest of these on the call every more every Monday morning at seven AM 'cause it's a good global time to meet ...\nIt's it's highly connected and it's the right network\nSo while the look at the of course the page right because it's so international yeah right so it's like when you look at the event page you know two sons in their way of uh you know Amsterdam or you know not only hire oh right right yeah\nNo I mean it is it is this is the this this this organization is credit twenty five thousand jobs globally and just the last few years and it's a significant and some of the company's you'll recognize you know well\nWho does to you and the crew for all the hard work and don't mess up the final telling us\nI'm gonna I'm gonna cram I'm going to study done\nBut you know I Hope to be coming back and talk more about it as we move forward uh it's\nIt's important that we create and this to be very fair as much as we talked about kind of analog non tech companies that has really focused ON Technology scalable ideas right\nDoesn't have to necessarily be pure tech but it has to be scalable because we're trying to build again just like we've always been doing we're trying to build companies that will create jobs that will transform the economy\nWell and we have to get there yeah I feel like don't you feel like we're behind\nWe are although I just talked with Dr graduate last week if you're a computer programmer he's hiring three developers a month for the next year in Tucson\nSo I Need to come up with thirty six developers alright if you're out and they want a good paying job with a great company out of reach out to express their interests are I've got an email address ... Tony at biz nerd hero dot gum ... N E R D hero dot com that's amazing right ...\nVisited here eight forty seven in the morning one more segment with Tony for our business nerd hero a failure so let's go let's go see some rape sponsors\n[noise] John I'm going [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "Wake Up Tucson - Chris DeSimone & Joe Higgins", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "09"}
