bites from ... to me good stuff fabulous restaurant ah let's talk about uh let's talk about star is born real quick before it gets your\nBut I don't get because I I alluded to it ... the last time we were on a couple of weeks ago the movie was coming out and I actually went and saw it and uh a little background for me I saw that Chris christopherson ah in ah Barbra Streisand version\nUh when it came out and I hated the movie and and and I I just didn't think it was cast very well I thought Chris christopherson was really often not good in the movie and I wasn't going to go see this one but I've seen some coming attractions and I thought\nA good in the movie and I wasn't going to go see this one but I have seen some coming attractions and I thought wow these to really look like they're hitting it\nAnd um my wife felt the same way and we went and we absolutely loved the movie it's Ninety percent uh reviews and rotten tomatoes and eighty four by the audience I think it's sensational if there was ever to people that were cast perfectly it's these two ... and quite honestly a real big surprises Andrew dice clay\nLays pay and none of that stuff but he plays a Lady Gaga as a father in the movie and he's a limo driver any sensational in it it's really and see I'm Elliot Senate and he's great uh it's it's a well well\nOn moving Iran Iraq that yeah that's for personalities film Bradley the dice man and Sam Eliot while and Bradley Cooper directed it\nAnd so I didn't see I'm Elliot is quoted as saying you know what he may be one of the best directors I've ever worked for wow yeah I mean it's it's sensational and like I said I wouldn't say that if I didn't really mean it and and I was just blown away because I wasn't expecting much and I it was great very cool yeah triple thumbs up from\nDr Van Buren when it comes to so now it's interesting so you texted me earlier this week and you said you know we're going with Richard Dreyfuss films right what what what inspired this or that you know I bet if a great actor I've been a big fan\nFrom a long time ago I'm In my coming coming of age movie was of American Graffiti and of course he was in that\nAnd I thought he was sensational and he just has he he he is over a hundred and twenty film credits and uh I just think I think he's a sensational after he was in jaws I mean he he's been a lot of very very good good films\nAnd he's a he's an Academy Award winner he when he won an Academy Award for best actor I assume that was all that well we'll get to the top of my list so thank you for saving me thank you I Apologize right\nSo I Will start off with number ten is moving over parrot or and and I looked at some clips of this last night again and start us away because it's it's the story he plays an actor or struggling actor and he gets hired by a this fictitious country parrot or because they're a\nDictator dies in the in the country could go to hell in a hand basket if you can say that on the radio Venezuela better right and and so basically they hire him to play because of the people don't know that the dictator is dead so\nThey hire him to a a Raul Julia\nIs the um is the power behind a politician and so basically he takes dry fits into this meat locker and he goes oh here's some Kobe beef and here's some here's some at aged Omaha Beef\nAnd oh and here's our dictator hanging up [laughter] you know what I'm saying it was pretty funny I mean it really really was it was the actress who was known you brought that all men she yeah she's pretty uh pretty hot working in the ... yeah and uh I I Will tell you I I I think it's a very\nFunny movie so definitely some something what's the name of that though it is called moon over parrot or and he\nEven shows them how how the dictator saluted he did it with a flip you did it with a ... it's almost like the south America and Central American dictator version of Dave mildly yeah right yeah it's kinda like that it is the four days yeah absolutely so they they did what was that it was a that\nWas done in Nineteen eighty eight okay Nineteen eighty eight\nOr ... and then number nine movie ... this movie I was really looking forward to when it came out came out in Nineteen eighty seven it's called ten men and what is the story of is\nIs all these guys in the in the in the fifties and sixties basically selling aluminum siding to people right and there's this one scene I just I Can't get it out of my mind it's this one scene where Richard Dreyfuss is is uh\nIs working with his partner and he he pulls out this tripod and he's filming a easy taking pictures of this house and the lady in the house is like what are they what are they doing she comes out any in the scheme was this we're shooting for life magazine and we're doing the before and after an aluminum siding places\nIn your house is going to be the before picture and she goes I don't want to be the before picture I Want to be the after picture in in the long and short of it is they buy thirty five hundred dollars worth of\nFreddie good [laughter] so I thought it was fantastic but also um a Danny DeVito is in this movie he plays he plays the rival and a Richard Dreyfuss in him have an auto accident with her two Cadillacs and then they're going after each other all the time trying to each other's business it's pretty funny it really is\nNineteen eighty six and that is one of the world series and move the last time Pima County fix some of the road and that's exactly right but just yeah oh this is a really\nReally good movie and I I recommend it for young people\nBecause they think it's still apropos for today than by many Robb Reiner film a lots of young guys and a willingness to someone else I'm missing it was really a Jerry O'Connell river Phoenix I guess that's the one key for Sutherland\nSay oh that's right because he plays the older brother in this that strip stand by me saying give any king and here's the best one every possible by Richard Dreyfuss you have it as the number what\nI I have it is number five I'm hurt by that but I but I I Will give you back story to this is what I've done in Nineteen Ninety One and a Richard Dreyfuss plays a psycho analyst or psychotherapist world renowned and Bill Murray plays in that job\nAnd I the back story on this one is Bill Murray or add lip delight throughout the movie and it drove Dreyfuss nuts and he hated it and he to this day dislikes Bill Murray immensely I don't know if you can tweet us ... word and I\nSure schmuck got an e calls in ... in real life he really doesn't like the amount of all he thinks that he's very funny but he just doesn't like them at all and he doesn't like him in this movie and I think that realism and the film\nComes across and so you basically really really feel that\nUh one of a doctor Kevin leaving family psychologist Sharon movies is what about Bob yeah ah this ... ... if there's the film was a ... a lot it's this one\nAt someone close to ... that I Am of his book sometimes sometimes you have that for that person in your life that they no matter what you say to him you can't hurt their feelings right they just never go away yeah right that kinda thing right and what happens is that\nScene where where do you live before Bob Bob's not gone up here\nNow and then there's the scene around the dinner table he joins amount on their vacation he just shows up and he's at their house and he's eating corn on the cob and he's like oh boy this is good\nYou know what I just says this some sort of new radical death therapy Dr Martin Marvin go get it I own this on DVD is one of the greatest films we ever show\nGoing the rocky point it's a it's a great it's a funny movie it's it is good what's your next one that our next went up his jaws a saw this on opening night in Nineteen Seventy five when this came out Richard Dreyfuss plays a oceanographer\nAnd he he teams up with a with Roy shy or who is the law officer of this little community hamlet and a Robert Shaw who is a salty old sea captain and\nBasically ... late ... he was going to\nDie I die way too young for wow is he good and\nThe three of them go after a go after the shark in its sensational I I think I told you this before when we talked about this movie but it's the only book that I read in\nOne night I was in high school and I basically uh I I started reading it and I couldn't put it down I finished probably like three four o'clock in the morning\nOr some of these things are going on in this film okay first of all\nThe idea that in the end you end up with these three guys going after the shark right and you can't find three more different human knowledge either shah and Richard dry there is different is you could possibly be the first use really of a realistic semi realistic animatronic\nShark in Nineteen what's this you have any five Seventy and I think about that I mean that was pretty amazing stuff I I've seen I've seen that they have the same model in universal studios in Orlando and ah yeah I mean this is the this little stuff like that I'm Mr Spielberg really put himself on the scene and I I think that's what I Do yeah\nI think so too and Marie Hamilton place the mayor and this and he was also in the graduate but he he's oh we got to keep the beaches open because it's the biggest uh tourists the way we can forget about it it's like really typical I always I always\nSee Mary Hamilton I was somehow Holbrooke was look very similar yeah they do and of course the other big thing really in the end um son Williams music\nAbout gas will probably be film that put him on the map while it's weird ... great work before that but this is the one sure they'd opening scene where you see the girl swimming out at night and everything in it\nAnd it and if\nMean it gets ya I mean it's it's still I I've watched it recently and it it really still gets you are oh let's see one more before we had to break okay a number three I Love this movie uh only Seventy four percent around tomatoes I think it deserves more ... than your number one or it was I I I wanted to\nHotel uh taxes in in a ... west in the

millet but um but but I think it's good that parents have that option because you know the the traditional public schools aren't necessarily for everybody\nRight and another thing is competition is good\nIt is and it makes\nYou you guys step up your game and make sure Seth step up their game\nIt has and it's made us more efficient and has made us really focus on I'm providing good education for the kids\nLet's talk about um uh uh one of the big things you had to deal with this was a thorny bill school ah where basically enrollment dropped a lot\nYes an enrollment has dropped um will school has the capacity of about six hundred and sixty kids where exactly is the school so people know stony Dale is right down I Know and I'm getting old father okay right by not neighborhood great roads over their great roads\nOver the district on right now [laughter] um\nThat's actually what we had a video of the bad roads and it's literally in that neighborhood as some of the worst roads in the entire county [laughter]\nSo um that that neighborhood are back in the seventies it was great but over time I'm a\nKids have graduated and but there's not a lot of turnover in the real estate right so so of you know in that big area there's only a hundred and eighty kids from that area who are going to school there while they were picking up another hundred and thirty or so uh from open enrollment\nSo a lot of kids from flowing wells are for um kids who are children or the or the teachers there okay are are going there so we just over three hundred so Roger half capacity at that school and it's costing us about a half million dollars a year to keep it open\nSo have you had your druthers 'cause it sounded like you were on the losing side of the vote to close the school and I know for a lot of parents that's part of you know there's this is where my kids go to school and ... and we're ... we're always throw that they have that attachment right so the school what was your plan to do what would you do what would happen to these kids if you if they did close are thrown in jail\nSo I'm the plan was to move some of them over to Butterfield right which is about a mile less than two miles away okay and also to quail run elementary which is about the same distance\nThe special education program which at ... absolutely fabulous I'm was going to go to Butterfield okay and then we were going to be purpose the school and do some of the things with it that that we need real estate\nAnd I'm so back in April we had the boat\nAnd um there were four board members at the meeting and it ended up in the two to tie\nSo the resolution didn't pass while\nUh what other factors are playing and running a school district notice [noise]\nSo um couple of years ago we had the minimum wage increase\nAnd um everyone thought that was really great\nHowever there was no funding mechanism attached to that right and so public schools don't have any ability to um\nReally raised taxes are doing a we have some ability for the on the secondary tax rate ... but that we that was a hit to lots of over two million dollars wow and we we did have a budget carry over 'em that we're the we're maintaining\nAnd that that carry over was used up by that by you know by the increase of minimum wage and so it wasn't just the minimum wage for our employees who was also for the for the janitorial service and for the other contract of course you know so they had to raise their rates\nAnd you know school districts in particular kind of took it in the shorts on that\nWe've never heard that from the pro minimum wage people and how do you know an average size school district or going to take two million dollars away from the children's education\nRight and you wouldn't because you might help people will know exactly [laughter] uh let's talk about\nWe're in the middle of grade coming out from the department of education where is Miranda falling in all of those\nWe we believe that we're not wherever you want to be [noise] we're probably going to have a couple of these schools um and um it so\nWe we had a ... D school last year and uh we go to school developed a an improvement program\nUnfortunately last year the grades came out and then they send to them and then they published and back again and again uh you know closer to summer right so the improvement program that that um that the school put in place is totally in middle school um didn't really have time to um take effect we didn't have time before that\nAnd you know this this year when the grace of coming out for the you know for those improvement actions to really get implemented sober that'll be throughout the course of the school year well\nMy thing is I I'm really if you look at the grades and whether I Know some people don't like the way the grades were done I don't know how you feel about them but\nI crates across the board aren't greatness down there I'm an ... and I'm not impressed by what's going on in an fight either so if if you're not in cat foot hills or veils good mhm not as amazing as I thought they were going to be you know um [noise] it's kind of disappointing across the region\nThe problem with the with the letter grades and so we're the last several years the state has kind of moves the goalpost um they changed the assessments and so it took it takes some time for the you know for that to work into the curriculum threat um [noise] and you know you're you're evaluating\nSchools in the school district based on how kids do over a period of two or three days and I'm now I'm not making excuses by any means but I I just don't think that that school better grades are the best way to assess the school or a district um\nI'm concerned about graduation rates and concerned about attendance rates ran ran a has an eighty eight percent graduation rate it's better than the rest of the state ... ... is on par with our peers\nBut an eighty eight percent is not acceptable should be you know well into the nineties\nSo you've been very honest about a lot of these things the good thing as the war and everything that is so wide Tom Carlson for another four years\nNow this woman her her institutional knowledge of stuff is not very deep cold it's past time we eliminate the electoral college you're gonna love this line it it's a shadow of slavery is power on America today\nThe electoral college um\nAccording to the New Yorker the Republican Party has relied are not just on the core of the electoral college but also on the other electoral body that was designed to limit majority rule the U.S Senate\nAnd so of course they don't they're they're complaining that a place like Ohio Idaho that only has one point seven ... seven million residents should have the same number of representatives as the forty million in California\nSo of course again\nThey don't understand that\nIs so low up everything\nThank you very much a Republicans have and as a result hold the White House both houses of Congress thirty three states governorships thirty one state legislatures and now a conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nBut here's the money line I like this one instead of dressing up in costumes interrupting hearings are screaming and selling at Senate elevators\nProgressive should focus on the boring difficult work of civil e appealing to American voters and all fifty states perhaps in a few decades they'll finally beat the GOP at this game\nAnd I think that's what the ... I I think part of that conservative court will actually force them to maybe start you know legislating when they when things back maybe in a way that they know they can't get saved by a Supreme Court that doesn't want to be too strict in its interpretations so\nBut that's all they got it and you know the more Trump quote has victories the more they're going to go crazy they\nAre freaking out they just can't take it and it's like that like they said the last month or so and you have to remember when you go to the polling places results versus resistance somebody's getting something done and the other people just trying to blow stuff up I Will tell you um that um\nThe um if if the Republicans hold the house in the Senate and if that happens you the the Democrat CNN MSNBC freak out is going to be\nOff the wall you're not going to believe that you're\nYou're you're not going to believe the stuff that falls out of people's mouths if they don't get back one of those houses because and if and then if Trump wins reelection mhm it's going to get in same though\nYeah predicted a revolution earlier this year my neck not yet but it's getting close\nIf Ruth Bader Ginsburg getting sick I serve or something like that and we and they put one more a more conservative judge on the Supreme Court the freak out will be the size of the imperial Death Star so we'll see ... I always say would prompt for sixty three\nWe'll see I don't I you know I always say would prop for sixty three don't reward bad behavior of truck into three dams if you let these people take these seats by doing what how they're acting you're rewarding bad behavior that's why you gotta turning your votes right\nAnd you you can't act out of fear you have to be proactive and vote and just\nDo just keep them out okay because they are do they'll do anything you they they will do anything I I read it every day what they're what they're willing to do\nTo win because it's all about when it's not about the people it's not about what you need it's about them winning they lost in that hurts and they just want to win but they don't care about you worry about\nAll right we've got one last
