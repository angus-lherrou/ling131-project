around um\nI think I'm a state it's actually eighty three but still over thirty five year\nAbsolutely now so I'm\nNow an Alexander my buddy across that he's been a few of the resident taxpayer ring pound range or grad others since the ... sixties really well yeah\nI guess to start paying taxes right around Seventy or something like that so yeah\nYou are correct so I've heard it from him over the last nine years of this radio show or what he's seen as problems and to us the what is the ropes and observed about to USD and some of the problems\nThe worst thing I Would say is it has to many failing schools about thirty percent of the schools according to the state or failing\nPartially might blame that on the way that they figure that out\nBecause they don't consider what the kids have done while they're in school but they have the standardized tests that all schools take in those that rate below a certain get below a certain rate on most is a are considered either the were failing schools\nWhat what what what let's get real here okay I don't care how they you guys can tweak protesting any way you want\nWhat are the outcomes for kids\nRight when they get out of high school at AT T USD\nAnd literally what I see is the majority of to you as kids when they graduate already have a large weights around their their legs moving through life it's like Jacob Marley and the Christmas carol right with all the changes in the boxes on it yeah that's a to USD grad trying to make their way on the world\nYeah that is they had and burn prepared and that's it that's not really the fault of their kids is salty educators and I think a\nLot of the teachers try really hard yeah and some of the teachers have tried so hard that there coasting mode no right and so what\nWhat what was the moment that you said have you ever run for public office before never so what was the moment that pushed groups and the fill up the paperwork\nAn editorial in the store that was really knocking the tea with tea and I thought you know this is damn unfair\nThat these guys are you know they always pick the bad things I don't hear any good things about to USD and so I started looking into it to my core I felt they were right while it was a sense that\nNow so for you what about your background that you think if you get on the board can help you try to do it this is a big turnaround this is like turnaround CEO kind of the time this\nIsn't a tweaking this is a turn around\nAnd we started that I think the new superintendent it's doing a very good job\nOh he's much better than the previous than the previous three yeah\nUh so you know I I I think this is an opportunity for us to but I just I feel for the kids particularly\nMy parents were like gypsies when I was a kid or my dad the grass is always greener on another pastor right from kindergarten through third grade\nOne year for ... thank goodness they kept me in the school for the whole year they didn't pull me out I mean I hear some of the schools here they'll\nMight start with three hundred kids in school and at the end of the year they have three hundred kids in school but if you look at the kids\nMaybe fifty sixty percent of the kids started don't finished third new new people moved in old people have moved out right how can a kid without continuity I mean I noticed it because I went to K. one two and three\nEach of them were different school I finally went to the same school for two years in the fourth grade in fifth grade then we moved to billings Montana I was there through high school graduation but by then a lot of damage it really had that was a bright kid\nOr you could read by folks were cared we\nI could read by folks were cared we will care for but emotionally I never had a hard time fitting in and finding a place where I Belong I feel for these kids\nSo what are they give me two or three things that Doug robes and if you get on the board would like to convince to other people do agree\nWith you and change to USD to get better how would you how would you help improve to us to\nI think the most important person in the school is the principal I Know on on\nAnd I don't know if this would ever be possible but I Would say if the schools is if a school's failing gets an F great\nThat at the end of that year the principal unless you know needs to go and the new principal port in\nIf the school has a de maybe you can go for a couple of years or a third year if they if you can see the scores and she you know and if that's not happening the teacher needs to go I think that the real power in the schools needs to be the principal not some bureaucrat in the main office\nWell and that's been the history of to USD for decades as the bureaucrats attempt\nHim run of the ones who rule and ruin yeah\nYou know so I'm agree with you I'm a big principal guy you know or if they're you know I liked the idea that if they're going to be you know when you do the quote action plan mhm and if you don't make it after the action plan have a nice day you know but they have to hire good teach us how it works right good principals hire good teachers\nAnd it's right in good teachers can get it done in a good principle ... is a good principle will not let the school failed or will do everything in their power to keep that at school from failing and to keep her kids to to education for kids\nThey're the big thing I've always there for him to you as the teachers that they get very frustrated and this is back to ten ten is the idea that because it doesn't feel like\nThey're having control of their school right yeah they don't have they don't have control their classroom right right and they when they go to the principal either they're not getting support from the principal or the principal will say oh my hands are tied by things that are coming out of ten am\nYou know I got to wait two weeks to do a restored a circle after two kids got into a pretty serious scrap together that's the problem you cannot be used neither of these kids are going to operate like they should if we're waiting two weeks to code have restored of circles and figure it out this is not a way to go to school\n[noise] I agree with you there I think there is only I I unfortunately have only experienced with one school I was on the cycles will for many years which schools that\nThe one that's on a Tucson boulevard just south or just you know just south of grant rather and the name has just gone right out of my head\nOkay so uh what can people do to help you\nAnd I said grant I meant just before ... gotcha\nAnd Alexander you're my uh Craig and Craig thank you that's and that's the neighborhoods I figure\nHe was on top of it uh so what did you learn so at the council doing that for so many years what did you learn there about running schools\nIt seem it had an old time principal at the beginning right in that lady knew all she knew what to do right for teachers and knew what to do they did it and it was a very ... it they did well\nNow at some point they were ... blessing kids at one time from the yucky a reservation that is to the west of a\nI'm\nA big street going north and south

I ... and we're going to we're going to get one that's going to it's going to happen one day a\nDrug deal\nTell me about the tell me about the two folks that are you in just a ... running against but I I feel like I've interviewed one a few years ago and you could tell us a one trick solar pony ana but tell me about these two ladies that are running you know what's a lady in a guy I keep forgetting now oppose\nIt it it it's two ladies I'm a statistical probability you you've interviewed one of them or at least once or twice 'cause she literally been running for the corporation commission for the past Twenty years right or hurting her name's Sandra Kennedy uh she's\nIn government for for Twenty years before running or condition for Twenty years um I I there's an irony this week\nI because that standard Kennedy are a number of years ago I filed bankruptcy and ways that sued by the uh the IRS for about two hundred thousand dollars in back taxes and as a that this weekend as we all read the newspaper yesterday\nI ... years has now filed for bankruptcy and were literally running against one with the Kennedy and one woman\nNamed Sears while and that so it it's a it's a it's a crazy racing and there is a stark contrast between the Republican candidate democratic and ate a sander Kennedy I'm no business experience to other than that that that that bankrupting a Denny's back in the day her\nGoal is to champion the passage of prop one to seven and she said if you can't get it done at the ballot box and then she's going to make sure that all of those mandates happen at the corporation commission\nIt sure that all of those mandates happened at the corporation commission and her partner\nIn crime a woman named that beyond the Sears I'm also a limited if any uh business experience comes from the government sector um she quit her job\nAt the corporation commission as a as a low level staffer to run for connection I could get paid more and uh her vision is to also championed the passage of crock one to seven during the mandate by\nFears also has a second agenda which is she a hates Arizona agriculture\nWhen it went whoa whoa whoa whoa what does that mean that she hates Arizona agriculture it's going\nWell and and every single public debate that has happened both in their primary in general I she announces that we should stop agriculture in Arizona because John a Sears feels that it's a bad use of water she cites the fact that farmers in ... county grow alfalfa\nExploited the Saudi Arabia and every single time\nThat she says that ... I have to remind her that Ninety five percent of the lettuce that's consumed between Thanksgiving and Easter for the entire United States comes from Yorba which also as an example of Arizona farmers growing things with water that that leaves the state\nAnd I do now you're your own water guy explained film I Know that a human has a high water table right I mean if you dig a pool and you know you'd better watch out but tell me about the water table him now in America ... do you most was running through their over the weekend educated me\nWell there there there's less access to water in central Arizona than there is in Yuma sure where they're right along the Colorado River but most importantly when it comes to the Arizona corporation commission crash number one the commission only regulates the three hundred private water companies in the state so when she\nMakes those kinds of pronouncement highlights that she doesn't even understand the job that she's running for\nSecondly I'm the corporation commission was created to nurture\nThe Arizona economy and protect Arizona ratepayers\nWhich anytime you're talking about destroying Arizona economy or elements of the Arizona economy that obviously is inconsistent with the job\nOr that she's running for as well and it's just it's just it's it's bad policy it's bad advocacy and it highlights that uh she as well as sand the Kennedy aren't really interested in doing the job that they're running for its about social engineering and that's why we're out they're urging everyone to make sure that they vote for the two Republican candidates Rodney Glassman\nJustin Olson because there will be two winners this November and we want to make sure that um it's neither of them\nNow a when a PS in the ... have come from some read bumps over the last several years if you are sitting on that uh that commission would you have been a yes vote on the one that they have received in and tell me if if there was no why\nNot what I can tell you is that um I Would have asked many many more questions um I I\nRan against and defeated the current chair of the corporation connection Tom Sawyer excuse the ones that get my campaign was able to knock out and what I Know about previous hearings many previous hearings at the condition is it they were devoid of the city commissioners asking probing and tough questions\nOf the utilities that they're supposed to regulate I Believe as we discuss before\nA lot of that comes from the fact that there is no code of conduct on and so everyone's been a little too buddy buddy historically and that's that's frankly what I Want to change now something that has changed since we spoke last\nOn is that since the primaries now we're in and we're all rowing in the same direction I Will tell you that the judicial code of conduct active banging on and banging on his you know um since the beginning\nI'm just an old saying I has now come on board and so with Justin support and commissioner burns we're going to have the three votes\nTo get that code of conduct past and so based on that code of conduct being in place we'll be able to have their hearing that the commission where these utilities are asked the kinds of questions that need to be asked before these rate increases are either are voted on period\nSo what is a question or two that wasn't asked my previous commissioners that am Rodney Glassman commissioner or would ask\nHow old is your proposed pricing structure\nProtect affordability\nAnd promote reliability resiliency or safety how does it allow the consumer to both utilize\nNew technologies like solar right but also have a Ford of all rapes structure that kind of push back\nIn broad terms is the kind of pushback that historically this commission has not been providing and the whole reason they created the corporation commission as Arizona's force branch of government was to provide pushback and protection against the monopolies because the services are so important to our rate payers and our economy\nUh Rodney one of the ah one of the people that are very involved Republican in\nTucson a PC just sent me a message from Facebook they want to know that when the opportunity to actually the next time you're going to be in Tucson that that you're not doing you know killer foothills parties with it and mark is that uh you can come and actually normal people can come talk to you\nWell I Know I'm going to be in town this Thursday um if whoever reached out to support the educational Richmond foundation um they're having a fair amount of you back when I was on the Tucson city council and I heard the last caller\nTalking about how there's all these extra fun at the word offices well every single year that I was on account so I did one a few things I either return excess budget money\nTo the city by with through a direct transfer back to the to the general fund um or I distributed that money are invested in the parks programs where we rehab park a or a created teacher mini grand city educational what's your foundation so this Thursday they're honoring Bruce Burke\nI'm at the double tree I Believe the lunches from eleven to one um and I will be there and\nAre doing what you don't actually have any public campaign events than anyone can sue you between now and November\nUm if anyone's interested I'm happy to have a coffee when I get to that that would be a little bit early I'm not sure what the rest of the schedule looked like I Know there's a bunch of that event all over the state but off the top of my head I can tell you this Thursday I and if they reach out to be at my website uh Rodney Glassman a dot com\nOn insult Rodney Glassman I Will be able to schedule something because I'm happy to meet with anybody especially a Republican volunteers who are interested in helping us get across the finish line\nAlright Rodney it was good talking to be a good luck to them the racism and it'd be OK ... alright swimming and if you had a
