that Tucson parks might have a little too much in homeless and homeless and and drug addicts I Know I remember\nDoc Martin about fourteen months ago said he got a call from a city council person who said hey we got this football teams the youth football teams that practice that this park for years but it's a little too big of a homeless drug problem drug needles and all this stuff so we work that we like to see if the business community will raise some funds\nTo move the football players to eight now these kids to another park and the business community can pay for temporary lights the

H. T. convince crystal and cameras and I'm not and I don't eat that ... right\nOur cameras and crystal are all endorsing Adam Reagan you want to stay away from that guy to okay is that these ... we're going to fool the de sac people\nOkay okay so if it's a student who is Hispanic or African American who quotas getting in trouble we're just not really going to report it because what happens is at this pile averting when they came up with that system\nThey talked about how many ... Baloch about those covers was how many total incidents reported in the year right so the previous year let's call it\nA little incidents reported than a year right so the previous year let's call it three hundred then that this year all the hell was going on seven\nAnd wasn't because it was it happening because no one was reporting it or doing anything about it even became a joke at liberty is how many times can I pissed off somebody and get in trouble before something actually happens while\nIt was like a contest what a shame All right so in relation to your concerns on why to weaken the weekend that uh what was that principle of booze fick at uh the guy that they fired because he talked to the press that guy okay he came on the show he teaches tennis I remember his name as he came on and said\nThis is where we're at the discipline policies here are off the wall because we're trying to manipulate the numbers so so the idea that this happened a thorough I wasn't surprised sad to say\nI think one of the things that I'd like to see happen at USC is we've set that standard so low we need to raise it argues our kids will raise to that standard if we bring it up if we demand excellence if we demand appropriate\nBecause she voted for the new discipline code now a break and it's just been in effect about three months\nIs it an improvement at all\nI Would say the answer is yes it steps the right direction but when you still have her on the board it still has to be measured of course but I Do believe we're moving in the right direction and that's because last election we changed the majority right and that's you the people out there that you wake up Tucson\nFlexing your muscle and saying we won't allow this to happen anymore and that's what I Hope will happen just a few days November six that you will say we're done with you while the leader\nSo we're radio show 'cause we love the show videos\nOn on our on a radio show but there's a lot of good meat in this one so uh if you go to know fifth term\nFor adults with them they have a YouTube page and they have a little uh ... two to three minute video here that kind of is I think is a very nice summary that if you're a tea or is the a tax payer parent or teacher gets to vote in this thing\nAnd you vote for adult leaders ... you're literally cutting off your own those that is absolutely right and your children's noses let's go at Alexander\nHow much is too much over the past sixteen years Tucson Unified School district has lost half their Fifteen thousand students that silver twenty five percent of the entire student population why me I guess\nThe answer simple sixteen years is the amount of time I don't either grow hall that has been on the tea us the board that's four terms too many\nThat is why there should be no fifth term for adult leader gr hold on I ... to ... has repeatedly voted to weaken student disciplinary policies for years she oppose setting instructional spending targets even though the U.
