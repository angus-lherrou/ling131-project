importantly is our business directory so it does support small business because they should be on our directory\nAnd it has reviews and ratings and you can show complaints\nAnd it's really important

the number two um we go up and go through right now I got to talk\nOkay so our climate support teacher statutory rights to prove to surface students your principles were options for progressive disciplined regular training unfair ineffective classroom management twenty percent\nTwenty percent is for the change in the ... she is are the disciplinary code code you didn't vote for no cause I was only twenty percent right so I that's an improvement that's where the twenty percent comes from but we still are protecting teachers that's where he writes\nTwenty percent comes from but we still are protecting teachers that's where he writes we have minimally increase principles more options but they have to go upstairs to get some stuff approve that they didn't have to go upstairs to get approved before so in some ways is backward number twenty percent\nAdopt annual stipends for special education other physicians that are hard to fill a ... a special certification twenty percent and the only reason we get twenty percent there is the board did vote three too but that was a win\nTo spend some small part of the D.C budget doing exactly that and be safe schools after years of battle I got a little bit\nSo if you're a de ... not in a decent school and you're looking to hire special lab that does not exist\nOh yeah and I'm not sure what it's going to map too because we didn't put a dollar amount on it we just said something because if I put any like dollar amount on it it would have gone down\nAnd do you say a special ed teachers are such a high demand that\nOh yeah and math and science but I say I but I'm saying we got a crack in the door we got a foot in the door there and so I give out twenty percent number for reduced came one class sizes I said for years we need to invest more in the earliest grades because that's when\nI had I not reading a hearty Boyer Nancy Nancy Drew book by sixth grade\nWell that's part of it is zero percent that's it ...\nWhat's left size average class sizes think right now with a K through one to you as the school\nWaiting forty thirty five\nOh no no it's better than that it's better than that because I hate to say because we have a lot of under enrolled schools where the facts are small so\nSorry I think I Know but it's not that was one thing I was ... it'll be somewhere between twenty and twenty five but this is really important right when I go back to ... and it's very inconsistent across schools if there's a defense for a kid in the against the world\nAnd bad teachers and bad systems is their ability to read right if the kids can't read with proficiency you're basically disabling them the rest of their life\nWell that's right yeah and there's a there's a lot of stuff about there's a lot of behavioral stuff kids come in with all kinds of backgrounds we notice right in kindergarten some of them are ready and I don't mean reading ready I mean socially red shirt lecture we ready yet or the maturity level ready\nSome art and so a lot of it it's just kind of catching kids up to where they're ready to function in a school environment Iraq and that that's a lot of work for K. one teachers a lot of it happens in K One and we\nNeed to invest more in that but most\nBecause what happens is superintendent is our high school for high school principals\nI'm not sure right\nElement I don't know why this is true but elementary leadership does not tend to be some superintendents and I think that's a shame\nBecause what happens is you're right that so if you have a too many kids per teacher in K through one and you have one to one or too many kids that are a little more disruption\nRight then again the rest of the class suffers and there's even a bigger effect of that too\nWell and that's true even at high levels but at K. one you've got kids coming up with all kinds of different stuff and\nYou got to sort of bring kids up to the same so they're playing on the same field or close to the same field by second or third grade and then the rest of the subject or easier right\nI see an eighty percent coming up what did you give yourself and you guys an eighty percent on\nA sin aggressive classroom spending targets because this year we set the fifty two percent target for classroom spinning and was then I went five percent targeted Minnesota spending again after years of battle right we got that done\nThat's great um and that was actually for one cause as Lida I don't know why she changed their vote this year but she supported that so that ... percent or\nSo she was on running for reelection\nOh is that why shocking I Know I'm such a I'm so I'm so a cynical you know there are a number of sex or streamline the top level of administration I'm given fifty percent there because there are few actually has done quite a bit okay not as\nMuch as we need to do but there's there's been some excellent significant Edmund cuts next one a number seven give schools more freedom in resource allocation increased principles authority twenty percent because under a lot of pressure from me I'm\nWe give them or giving them more control over their title one money so school is a good title one money and this is how I used to be present pre the\nFellow who shall not be named right and so we've gone back to that say more discretion there so I get that twenty percent but it's not nearly what it should be a overall review and implement ... recommendations for management audits number eight I'm I'm generously giving twenty percent\nBecause the ... to the U.S is famous for all these consulting report or are we ignore\nOh yeah oh yeah and and in this in a start article where they interviewed the candidates several of them said what we need is a strategic plan\nPlease please we like Judy brands used to say you know we could pay for the walls of the boardroom western teasing plans vision statements and it's it's just the way not to do any\nWell you know what's amazing about all the all those couple of those things are always the one of the things that always came out of the last you know a thousand eight hundred thousand dollars of reports you guys have done over the years is lining up curriculum right they keep telling you the curriculum needs to be lined up\nBetter oh that's another weird 'cause you'll do it like like every year someone comes to the board and says we're finally solving the curriculum problem is nearly ... ... where are you in it for years and years and years what's your aspect I even if the bored me and he was a deal this is kind of tough to ask\nBecause we're actually in this room with no curriculum we walk through a door to a new curriculum and then it's an empty room again apparently and there's another door\nThat's a little too negative but it it says a lot of we're in\nPositive I see a hundred percent coming up with the number now okay\nNumber nine um improve financial accountability beverage throwing the independence biotic committee hiring internal auditor um\nAre you seeing make 'em coming out of the new law audit committee that's making sense\nWell I think we all know the effect of poverty and student achievement is a very negative it's a big issue\nWhat I've seen from the ... they don't do much to solve the help people get out of poverty through their decisions uh that's just\nWell that's that's one of my big issues that we've talked to the point and this is where a lot of the left has gone to the point where we say we have to fix poverty to make education work right cause these poor kids can't learn can't teach them\nWhen what we need to be saying is that we have to fix education to help people get out of\nPoverty of course it's always on the whole premise of great equalizer ... left\nOn its head and they don't if we give up that argument if we like if we like say well we can't educate kids 'cause they're impoverished that's the whole game right that you gave away the whole argument right there that's\nNot acceptable it's not acceptable and it's it's crazy rhetoric cause then why are we doing public education if it's not an equalizer anymore if we're not bring kids out of poverty what's the point what's the point right like a rich rich for your parents can educate their kids they don't need a\nSeal is the again I just buy the of how the duck walks and talks right it's a social experiment with a jobs program for buddies that is what I've seen all the\n... the jobs struggle for buddy saying is such a issue in tears the there is such a network of family connections and friend connections and all that stuff going on it's worse in some parts of the district and others\nAre before we get to the phone calls let's get to All right I'm right I don't think that's why I'm here to ah you know so when I Want here's a question for him if let's say Adam Reagan or a ... an adult ... that kind of crude gets in on this election\nOr late ... and I like lay low personally right I mean she's right but if you read a Web page right\nThis is the agenda that has been killing to USC\nWell I brought up on uh her uh have will continue to kill it\nI brought up on our interview that she has you know there's there's definitely common investors in both her as an adult leaders campaign\nWhether the ... the platform is the same the agenda I don't see any difference in the agenda and it's an agenda that\nWill result in continued hemorrhaging to private schools charter schools especially and other districts\nAnd I don't know how\nAnyone to this point thinks that agenda is the route to survival for the district\nThe um when I'm looking at is um [noise] the ah with\nSo my question is I I put this on Facebook yesterday if that happens right adult lead a counts or Reagan that top three two of the three get him right we're really literally do a point where the silver lining is that to us the instead of cars right now you guys are slowly dying of gangrene right you've got that\nYou have to be able to ... things are happening I Know that\nBut overall it's still the bear ripped off your arm and you\nAnd I know that but overall it's still the bear ripped off your arm and you haven't seen a doctor and in in six years and that's the way so my thing is if you get those guys and they'll just running into the ground faster and maybe the state of Arizona will take over and started over\nWell Adam Reagan in ... counts of not being on the board and so if they get elected they deserve a chance to show what they can do right regardless of anything said during the campaign by anybody or about anybody correct that my expectation is\nThat they will basically the fans the status quo the same status quo Mary ... was defending\nAnd that\nHas been gradually running a district in the ground\nSo I'm looking at me I Will say oh I got the ...\nVision for you is that right so she brought this up right we're gonna we're gonna increase music art and P. P. E. to all the USC schools right number two we're going to create heart is in almost all to use the school's\nCreate smaller class sizes by having expanding dual language choices for families how\nHow I don't I Can't even cars that out is at six panic do a language which is a big obsession of some part of the board already ... how does that reduce class sizes\nYou the only way that works is you still exactly what you said on your grading right is are we increasing the support in those early class those an elementary school\nRule languages mostly for higher grades although not acts\nBut what I'm saying is do you still have to invest a resource and having another teacher\nRight where does the money come from well the answer is of course we're we're going to go begging to the state for more money you know it's always whenever it comes to money it's well we have to get more money from the state\nNow we're going to fix our teachers' shortage internally by growing our own to you as the teachers starting with James Head in the tea each student's so we're going to help the U.S the teacher's obtain their certificates by collaborating with local colleges [noise]\nWell that's not an objectionable statement but I don't think it really addresses the issues the reasons to teachers leave oh I have a price us email I should've printed it out before I got to hear from a teacher maybe two three weeks ago saying Dr Segre in my school is out of control\nCan you find it on your on your lap and yeah the outset you are right now no when we go to break out have you and then they'll have a so sad to think that ... seems\nLike a bright lady okay and what I see here is I Try to get out of our interview was only one segment is what are we actually doing about student achievement right that's why I got into my route again about can we teach kids how to read you know Nancy Drew by sixth grade and can we do I'll I'll give empire John's six times for\nMy freshman year so I Want let's do that\nSpin achievement is not to districts culture right I mean that's I mean it is the culture of certain interests all I care a lot it's the culture of certain teachers who care a lot there there there there in the district but it is not the district wide culture\nThat is that what you just what he just said that's the money line right up right\nSo the whole deal it's not the performance is not the culture of two U.S they closed it down while again what what why do we need more like are they doing that no I mean that's another huge\nAlright change that just a whole change ingest all\nSummer service [noise] I Know a get [laughter] Sanders going to spin is the way the seventh\nGrade and sponsors and we really and I promise I'll get to when we come back you're going to please
