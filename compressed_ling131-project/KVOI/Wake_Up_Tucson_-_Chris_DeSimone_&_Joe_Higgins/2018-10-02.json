I'm I'm very proud of the growth and we had our in our\nEverything um I I'm very proud of the growth and we had our in our catering business you know our director of food and beverage\nIs director of food and beverage at as my old high school or college roommate is that right\nOh so he's done great so we do a we have a a prop breakfast with champions or that benefits Special Olympics coming up or it's not open to the public but you can get on their website if you want like the ten um\nOctober twenty six in the arena Marco Antonio ... um so uh we got Comic Con coming up a Kevin Hart Kevin Hart shows in the in the musical out Kevin Hart ... normally plays a arenas catching them for two two shows on\nNovember for a seven to nine thirty wow or not the one thing that can be interesting to become just heads up a year going to be asked put your smart watch and or and or your phone you know ... which means you kept it won't be able to broadcast\nIt in a younger bag so it basically limits your phone to being used and it locks it up and you can't broadcast or you have to admit bags what's that or did they had to\nBring their own younger back not got a tour brings them although\nUh so we have those going on today they well it's I think it's a great idea yeah you know ... you know don't don't video ... enjoy it\nWell and I keep hearing this from acts that I like right when they say well why put this out of everyone's going to put it on their their phone\nAnyway right I like younger bags for high schools\nThat's that's a good idea vegetarian after the kids in high school ... guy on her back\nI'm just then kind of wrapped up here a code in November we have the the Celtic Thunder tour in a musical joke about a mile so if you're blues fan um enemies to call a ... in December real quick the K love Christmas show we know them well yeah I'm sure you do in the arena\nOr and then finally just down the line look for or not the temperate Christian show in March the road show must've jam circus away and of course the Tucson sugar schools\nThe um and then southwest nutcracker always a big\nWell yeah yeah December is not cracker season for right\nAnd again uh you know you have the Tucson Stephanie always going strong yep doing what they're doing or what has been different for you or as a guy who's worked different markets coming in your back to Tucson\nWhat's tell me explain the cooking process a little bit because you you and I were talking about um when you guys book Twenty one pilots right before they skyrocket yeah we caught him at the right time\nBut talking about that process of getting them at the right time and how it fits but sometimes it comes to Tucson because it fits right between other dates corrections\nThat her yet she you know and I used to rock shows for a living okay so you know I can tell you about each marking how would you go from here kind of thing right what's what's within three hundred and fifty miles um or three hundred miles um so yeah Tucson is it's\nThere's only one direction you basically go from here you know it's either Phoenix or towards they'll pass all kind of like ... it's not like you're Kansas City can go for directions\nSo it it's not the easiest thing to drought so we try and make it easy for them to do business here\nYou know a ... well we we we we returned emails [laughter] I mean we asked questions as quickly as we can be ... as far as note or scaling and you know set up and and everything else like that so I'm\n... ... it's a we've been fortunate you know I've been very\nLittle guarded how how we rebuild this market costs are wise right and I think uh bringing people in that probably didn't promoters it probably didn't have the best time for a couple of years bringing back in the music call get their feet wet again and sell them tickets and then we'll start moving looking at bigger and bigger things\nAnd you're right the idea that it's so I'd probably about this with some of my clients in in the business right\nPhone respond timely amazing what ... what happens\nIt's I I come from the from the air because when like I said well I used to book shows on the other end of it a when a promoter since you asked a question here what did that answer thirty seconds before you asked it\nCorrect correct and you if you're not and agents are worse you know they might have a minute before you're promoting a show you're booking a show and you call up a a venue and you get a voice mail right right yeah I mean that a problem\nNow I mean it was the person gets back to you and you could read um you know you develop relationships with you it's like any business in relationship business there's ... there's a guy named Frank Roach I'm a ... who is a little bit of a mentor of mine and he told me when early on like you don't book brick and mortar\nYou put people right you know so it's based upon relationships so that that that's great so uh overall yeah we've been very fortunate to get some good actually you know promote positive great fired getting out and come here it was great\nRight on his third final four\nWell now he's ... throw it in words that we all know how I'm going to laugh but yeah that ... he was great at the D.C area\nAnd so I didn't even realize that there's a a movie about him now ... coming up called rocket ma'am oh I didn't know that that's going to coincide possibly what this final tour right which will probably still it's doing great businesses last worse than good so\nAll right let's do this we're going to give away or how many tickets to Dwight Yoakam we've got two tickets to Dwight Yoakam\nSo there's a October Eighteenth PCC effects or bring 'em it's like a real pleasure in the music also it's intimate show it was ... yeah you see it yup alright
