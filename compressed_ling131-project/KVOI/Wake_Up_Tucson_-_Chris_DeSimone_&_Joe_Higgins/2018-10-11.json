regular folk wouldn't know it was in the in my old apple music days they would be the essential thank you [laughter]\nSeven nine zero twenty forward is the phone number or let's go to Matt on line two is this this this is Matt Russell\nNo no I Know it it it's the other but I'd love to hear from that Russell is a lot to talk to an\nEnd of the morning and I feel\nBad now I'm going up like actually literally apologized I'm at right below him like a very good dinner do yes other Matt yes\nYes yes I I I Will call them and let them now with regard to the circle of the business cycle\nOf this a Tucson yeah you know first of all um we have to have a reason for people to come to Tucson festivals I'm Ken last example yeah um you know turkey Tucson\nI'm second we have to have places for people to stay we clearly increase that product um we have more hotels downtown we have more space we have more space coming on them and you're tracking all that you're constantly aware because of what this means is is\nIs revenue for Tucson for sure because they go to the hotel they go to the bars they go to the ... the the uh the mall maybe yeah and they and they go to the festival\nI'm In the circle of our business cycle or have you guys factored in this new thing with air being the I don't think it is a threat to the hotels and the motel um it looks more like it's a complementary thing you know uh in cities are you are you seeing that\nYeah for sure so the ah Arabic has been paying room night taxes in Arizona it's this calendar year and then by the end of I think January one of twenty Nineteen all\nAll a room sharing a property sharing places will pay room night taxes which is is it just it just seems pop right for the market right what's more money coming in and it means a little bit more regulation but the your it's able to be ...\nWell it is and also they have to be kind of voluntarily paying it because it's not like the city is going to be oh no they do they have to pay\nIt comes on air B. and B. is collecting ... and all those places collect directly so but now it goes to the state and then it comes back so that's a sir sir cute in process well but um but it does happen so they they are if you go and rent an air B. and B. in Tucson right now you would pay\nA the room like taxes and so or ...\nUm so we got is a is actually a big it's a bigger part of our strategy than it was because when they weren't paying\nA bed taxes than they were dead to us or you know I mean to be honest because no it's true because it wasn't helping our budget and because it was sort of outside the sort of gray legality race\nSo my take on the the the inventory of rooms that whether there are people who only ... coming so I think what you're saying about the complementary thing is true but at the same time it does increase your inventory of total room nights yeah for a place and so it takes you longer to I think it's dragged or any cities occupancy\nIt level even tried to move up it challenges occupancy it also challenges re a rate right on because I'm like look even like to say our best time period the gym show right if there were I I I can only guess how many air being the rooms are online during the Jim show but I I\nI'd say it's probably in the thousands I'd agree with it um so you have a thousand extra rooms that challenge the rate right of your traditional properties of a star pass a double tree of whatever it is right right um\nBut you you it is there's an inevitability to it as well right like this is the market we live in air B. and B. is not going away and it's not\nSo in the classic days of less inventory in Tucson Jim show right it would the compression of the business would actually spread out the ... down the towards no gal us because we didn't have enough room you got to shore but that's not really happening it like it used to and I think they're being has that is having that effect but to be fair you look\nAt a hotel McCoy which is I'm new at it because I've been to a grand opening to Saturday actually ... their you try to book a room and hotel McCoy for February which is that was a silver bell how many ... a hundred something okay and there you know those those numbers start with a four\nYou know it's a renovated motel and they're going to get four hundred and some bucks a night for the ... so I mean\nI mean can I can I get at the end of this is to say a to ask you Dan I'm you you're looking around the rest of the country and the world yeah quality\nUm you're giving up much credit to look at the world but yes\nUh I like to think we're a world class town in some ways for ... in this in this regard or what what are we missing next that you think it's coming on the horizon obviously I I won't hold you to it because it's prognostications thank you so much for what you do you\nThink about I I think that the question for Tucson I mean this is this is solely Dan Gibson's opinion that it's not like you know I'm I don't I don't think we haven't had this conversation in the larger scale necessarily but I Want you to do from now on a everything is Dan Gibson's opinion and then when it's someone else's you say that\nTwenty second street and Second Avenue right now [laughter] rain night and tomorrow continuing to forty percent chance therapy in thirty percent chance on Sunday and lie about even today but it only Seventy five starting tomorrow we're already up to\nSeventy or those pools clouds this morning and he jumped thirty ... [noise]\nHappy birthday to Daryl halls and yeah\nAn uncomfortable situation go see a holiday would show in ...\nRight right oh man they hate each other you can like any like wildly a parent you know like if they're the Everly Brothers affiliates all at\nThis point yeah and I mean I Love that they were so good because it was a good\nShow it was like it wasn't a bad show it was like they're not speaking you know what I mean and they show clips from details house and then they showed clips from\nOats is like whatever it was ... motives Shaq and they're like it's a it's like oh she's never talked anyhow though I don't even talk all we have on the line and tell her of a stolen or\nA rock yeah true I'm so listener 'cause I mentioned earlier at I was going to torture you with a a connection to one of my guys\nWith Darrell hall yeah right until listener hit me on Facebook and wanted to know what that was and it is that Daryl halls at a song in the late ... an album called secret songs like AAA right avenues andme guitarist on a lot of those songs as my boy Robert trip\nFrom king crimson ... thing so yes Robert trip and Darryl hall have done an album together into our check it out it's called secret sauce\nOr get a degree it's going to a show one day it's gonna be like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon it's going to be the six degrees of yet I could do it just going to be coming back like we got we got a family tree of all the way we can do it all\nA Mexican director Guillermo del Toro like you know I'm like you know then connect them to yeah well that's probably easy 'cause he actually isn't a proper\nWell one of the things I posted up is that in the new stars born movie yeah Lady Gaga is rock and a yes or no there you go I I've only heard good things about that movie which is somewhat surprisingly mark Van Buren Leon ... pottery fiesta he as are actual full review of it and he's going to give you some serious thumbs up on star is born tomorrow\nI a Bradley Cooper seems like a a everybody says it's great I got to see it like you I didn't but I think that was sort of space that I was out to\nA couple of things here one a it's a huge weekend should write down the thing you said we're going to talk to in the next segment and then we ... cars not forget about it [laughter]\nFirst of all massive weekend a you know you're talking about what you guys are you always need 'em stuff stuff yeah content to sell out to the world in between ten west meet yourself and and the and the Tucson\nWorld in between ten west meet yourself and and the and the Tucson film fest uh but yeah the ... opening this weekend to their ... McCoy so people know ...\nI I yeah silver bell and the freeway\nYeah yeah\nYeah for real no it's ... percent for ... on the freeway yeah it'll deter slap each other I think so\nYeah that's what I'm saying Silver Lake no it's only three twenty ninth on the interstate yeah twenty ninth on the interstate yeah that's on the the west side sure there is a U Haul thing on the corner and then it was the silver belly and they had a very\nLarge science so at this place they're going to get ... they're getting four hundred dollars a night for February to stay on a on a highway a motel that was renovated\nIt is crazy renovate leap what I like the the amount of money put into it is in the millions that is amazing it is it is something you shouldn't bring out I Love rich uncle when they get out of their very busy 'cause they have the opening a drink of connects you to what city I Love to have a hotel McCoy Tucson loved to have them yeah ah they have a\nMurals by local artists like there's a whole bunch of Joe Patrick stuff all the way I saw that in the article all local food okay a local beer and wine it's not a fun All right well what will definitely have Ninety nine most of the top please make it happen a now one thing I also\nIs um the Charles kids are going to open up a seafood place next to Charles fake\nYeah yeah I'm In the former even Steven spot yeah though which it's funny 'cause like when even Stevens opened up a stuck in a car lot and I was like hey gets you up at like ... with athletes doesn't pan out not that I'm wishing poorly on them I my hope was a tortoise shop\nLike a Charo sandwich shop OK ... like ... yeah I think it's a tortoise no I'm into that too\nOh no no I ...\nI must say like maybe I'm just trying to use the secret here to make this into being\nRight well wouldn't you be into a el Toro Oh absolutely and which choppy massive right sure ... if you if they're making like a you\nKnow ... seconds tortoise\nI'm there yeah you had me at hello a stomach react or it could do the like the the ... you know for the whole thing can be great but the seafood places also really great idea and and the nice like\nIt it's just we have a fair amount of Mexican food places but there are like that down to nothing like that downtown right yeah so ... that would be the\nClosest that the um I Will tell you that reading Andy's article in the paper this morning\nIt was I Know who was a friday and flip she called it even Steve's\nYeah I don't [laughter] editors unite right ah but I have to say I almost like it was I thought the even the leaves a concept\nI well actually liked that joint but not really I thought it was pretty good I enjoyed the sandwiches I does not surprise me I've got a new CEO I think that it was funny 'cause it was like oh this is the most like\nTucson thing the ... when even Stevens close there was like this like stream of stuff on face like oh well this is that Tucson can't support these places\nLike maybe it just wasn't that well run like maybe the right as a guy who was again the old curmudgeon here yeah when I when I when I tried it a couple of times yeah and it just I'm like how are you guys I don't know how you're paying rent\nI it was never that busy but that the success of Charles steak I mean like Charles ... bumping all the time and like a place that does well they they have like the Cal football team in there the other day you know it is a place that they can do a ton of people all the time I'm\nIn a city park is coming online or in the beginning of the year so I'll be a ton of\nWhat a perfect combination of the floor as family and Gary Hickey finding each other oh I Know you've just been amazing\nYeah combination Gary incredible uh and you know it really is a perfect fit in the nice thing about Garry especially as you know the night fights stuff all the things he's doing\nLike ... pushing the conversation for him and Devin fan or who have you talked to people who are like you haven't set a context and cocktails and carriage house but like right guys have plenty going on yeah but it travels with the parents to like you have these guys were like\nWanting to make more of the of the atmosphere we went to ... and I went to one of those uh uh they got dinners yeah we went to the future of Tucson food but what struck me about that is that you know this was literally could be all people from a\nResort restaurants and the high end once they had one of the guys on that team was the owns a taco place in the total autumn swap meet right there was somebody who works at a restaurant where the restaurants in Raytheon like you know what I mean it was like there's so much talent in the city that they\nAre ... let's use another well not as big as secure to yeah All right uh the collegial ... for short of the food industry in Tucson, Arizona it's is\nOffer him I've never seen it like this yeah I Know it if you can go to one that got dinner I think it was like sixty Seventy bucks or something like that but it was with\nA ... you know what's a plus plus there was the wind was included the cocktails included and tip right um as far as I Know sorry if I didn't write him by bad um [laughter] ... we've ... we've heard about that we have sir I'm but I mean I think\nIt's a bunch of people from all these different environments making incredible food together like ... one of the things you know I'm not met Russell Matt mentioned like where do you go from here it's like well you know it's it's not a traditional CD thing but it's like how do we promote even that culture right how do we get more as a as a city as a as a demo end of the\nCity as well so for me if like if you got a story out there have been a major metropolitan newspaper as we say Superman yeah okay that talks about what Tucson is doing as a community right as a food community yeah and people because it's a great story\nOh for sure I understand we're working on from the little guy\nDown to the you know to the the resorts chef there's no there's new pretense of anything\nThat's the whole thing yeah if you ... it's a little bit of the culture of the city I think in general right I mean I'm I think being the underdog most of the time has that positive effect of like hey we're in this together you know but uh the lack of ego yeah that\nAnd I 'cause I've worked with chefs and other cities like on other things\nI'm just telling you the lack of ego germ or in the food\nCreation community is alien president's going back to a previous point\nThe front people that you have yeah you can go out and sell out there sure is really amazing like a travelers from parish right yeah for sure you got you got ... who's one of the best out there yeah ... is one of the best out there then you get your up and comer is like a Gary carries a rock star out of their Wendy from America is a man woman right right I Love\nFor when you put her out there in front of people man\nYeah this is ... rocket it out well you know in a ... someone you've texted me a hard time about a but Maria at Boca to write like she's ... you know when it's funny the thrill always with Maria", "year": "2018",
