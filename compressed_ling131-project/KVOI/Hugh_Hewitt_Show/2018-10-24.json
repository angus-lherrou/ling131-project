station\nJust bizarre ... we're really motivated and it's only looked\nWhile I'm Glad to hear about that motivation on here's what I Would say in response to your your prediction that the blue wave is is just a made up media creation\nUm ... the reality of the situation is that historically the party that is not in power in the White House does gain a significant number of seats often times as many as twenty twenty five thirty seats in the next midterm election it has happened that way historically throughout\nYou know a recent ... uh you know American uh uh uh elections mid term elections so the idea that the Democrats are going to pick up a bunch of seats is not a math based on history is the fact they are\nThe question is will it be enough to actually take the house back to take over control that is not absolutely not guaranteed um and and I'm not suggesting that it's guaranteed that the Republicans are going to hold on to it but I look at all of these campaigns you nobody does it's better than you\nAnd I say this not to uh you know just a you know suck up to the namesake of the show but but nobody is on top of these national racist and where the battleground races are and which ones are the toss ups better than he does and it is you know you see that generic\nDemocrat lead over Republicans and the generic ballot of would you prefer a Democrat to leader public in the lead a and it's around plus seven to plus nine Democrats right now which would indicate holy cow the GOP is in trouble or give the gal back to the Nancy and let her a letter get ready because they're going to win\nBut that's when you count all of the very decidedly blue areas and again I'm I'm I'm learning from the professor Hugh on this the decidedly blue areas you know in in New York and California and other places\nThose were all added in but when you narrow it down to the sixty or Seventy closest races the ones that are toss ups hideous literally a toss up it is literally a toss up between\nThe reading this little candidate and it is absolutely imperative that the Democrats want to win that they when the vast majority of those to overtake the Republicans in the house and I'm confident we can hold surface but what can I got my friend sitting in for you if you're on the radio [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action packed information bless these huge ...

program now Stephanie of course the MSNBC Live anchor coming up at the top of the hour Seventy good morning morning to you\nThank you for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means\nTo be a nationalist the president of course declared it a Houston rally that he is not a global is the of the nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being a white Knight well asked anyway by Jim Acosta don't you mean white nationalist is it possible to just be a nationalist meaning I care about Americans before I care about the concerns of the globe\nHere's the thing is is just not necessary or a great way to articulate your patriot H ... someone defends our nation or the value of our nation above all others in a perfect world say well that can mean a nationalist to what a perfect world he quit\nBut we both know and we've heard from the likes of extraordinary leaders like John McCain out of work when each year\nThey get a good dog whistle at a time we are seeing\nRacism seen a phobia on the rise let's be better and not use that word\nWhy why why why you're if we're going to see if it is anonymous whip patriot which I agree patriotism nationalism\nI said in a perfect but we're not living in a\nWell why don't we ascribe perfect world instead of playing to the fears and the and again the racist the allegations of of people for political partisanship why don't we take our perfect meal\nBecause it's not like we're saying it's not like we're hearing from someone that has a high ... gets word who strike up a perfect world if you're the president who interrupting time after time and time again as you waited a speech saying that he you know David give\nThe president has already said in the last week I there are people from the middle east on that caravan and you and I don't know the dog whistling straight out of the gate and she came down the elevator at Trump Tower wait\nWait wait a minute wait a minute this this is this the president said after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of terrorists is that a dog whistle or an acknowledgement that my first duty and obligation is to the people of our country that's not a dog whistle that is a state I no loyalty to the to the people who are elected him\nThat's not a dog with so I'm not saying\nAs they're not saying everything is on a nationalist they're helping about our people before the people have Paris or the people around the globe\nI'm not saying that what he said that simply about the Paris climate accord was a dog whistle many many other things including many side speaking about Charlottesville worked out with\nBut the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nKnock comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a national is thinking about our country first in the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's national history I prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on here so we're going to agree to that were\nSaying well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know what is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's I'm not confident that sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back\nMany many presidents had said over the years and it's why someone like me feel uncomfortable\nOkay well what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable it's very you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway\nYou know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism in were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs\nIf I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better danger out of the market is that now is not not economic nationalism but is that\nNot economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president conducting itself it gives you the truth is that an impact he would engage in saying like ... to point out and partner with our allies\nThat have ... which is to say any role thank you for coming on your first year that she is on MSNBC Live at the top of the hour [noise]\n\nMiddle

surgery some pain is pretty normal I was hoping to get more pain killer and the first round works crate we're being very careful with those now\nYou know four thousand five thousand people marching toward our border in defiance of our laws why are we why are we ... allowing them to continue to sort of represent our interest because they're not\nYeah I completely agree Sharon Sharon Thomas Hodgson is our guest my personal county Massachusetts by the way you're you know the numbers recording I think our sadly I've dated a\nYou know two days ago it was up to seven thousand Mexican news agencies were monitoring the that massive a caravan through the country are estimating the crowd now at fourteen thousand so\n... ... and they're still weeks away from ... thousand miles them not to go to get to our border it could be twenty you could be twenty five by then so here's what I Want to know from a law enforcement perspective share\nWhat do you and other law enforcement officers going to do when these people get here because they are coming in Congress where you're writing Congress will not do anything they're busy campaigning back in their districts they're not even at work or in the capital now\nSo they're not going to change anything which means when thousands and thousands of people come to our border and start claiming asylum as you well know we cannot detain them we don't have the facilities to detain them at the border\nPlus it's been decided that that's inhumane\nAh and we can't turn them away so they're going to be released with a promise that they'll come back ah an honor their ... we know that eighty to Ninety percent of them don't so this this crowd I I'm sadly just accepting the fact\nOf now fourteen thousand which could be more is coming and they're going to come to Massachusetts they're going to come to where I sit in Ohio there going to come all over this country and spread themselves out never to be seen again until of course uh sometimes it's too late then we see them for the wrong reasons\nWell yeah and and the thing that that is important to point out too is that and and I'll just at that point in just a second but it's also important to know that you will call you by the county right now Colorado live releasing a hundred two hundred and fifty family units per day back into the community taking the bus bus stops\nThe greyhound bus terminals and putting them on buses and not because ice wants to but but by law they can only hope it for twenty days once that happens they have to give them their court paper when they have to return\nThe court dates for example in Massachusetts for some of the CIA rested today on immigration charge\nAnd it's told to come back to court the court they start coming up to twenty twenty four where do you think they're going to be twenty twenty four and how we're going to find them that's one that you know I've talked to one person thinking about a thousand sort of coming in never mind the fourteen thousand right now that are supposed to be coming across\nTrying to come into our country so yeah we have to do some this is why this is this isn't urgent situation and this is why can't believe Congress sits on their hands and it's more interested in their politics though they are taking care of the public safety of the people in our communities\nAnd our national security but this is this is as bad as a gift in for Congress to to not see this\nIs a fundamental responsibility they have is to protect the citizens of our nation that's what governments fundamental responsibility so I've been talking to the sheriff's Bob across the country and we're talking on the phone with western shirts\nAnd talking about what are we what can we do I mean we we as you know we started that crowd funding aids funding for the wall dot com I think we're over a hundred and thirty thousand right now we're getting ready\nWe're working on a presentation to\nAh to um ice I mean to a da chess or ... the first installment and then and then we hope that at that point when that happens we'll see the activity pick up across the country I actually had a guy like Steph came in before I went to Washington last week and\nSaid look you've got to read this letter was from a gentleman in Ontario, Oregon I opened it up\nIt was a five dollar bill five one dollar bills with a note attached to it said please build a wall between the United states and Mexico\nAnd I see locks the envelope in the five bills and the five dollar bill and I sent it to all the sheriff's around the country that went with us to Washington from the thirty five states said listen\nThis gentleman represents the best of America he's navy of modest means but he believes in some way that he can help you know joined with the sheriff's across this nation\nAnd fight to get this wall built which we've been asking for for Twenty years and um protect our neighborhoods because he sees as most Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the victimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I said you know this not only does he represent the best of America that this represents why we as sheriff's now have to take over for what Congress has refused to do were elected by the exact same people that Congress are\nBut it's it's our time in history now to step up stand with our people and let's get this border security which you know fulfill our obligation and our promise to the people are in spite of what Congress is doing work against us\nWhile it is extraordinarily important and I'm so glad to see people like you taking a leadership position because again we you know we we're gonna have to accept this I think the president's ah intentions of the best\nAbsolutely I think he has promised to put military at the border is is a great thing although it's nothing but show because they're not going to fire on people they're not going to physically you you know a stop people with tanks and ... they're going to just be there for show as a backdrop\nBut at the end of the day if they come up and use the right coded language the code words that they've been coached to say when they get there as far as claiming asylum\nThey're going to get a they're going to be given a you know some of us to come back and have that concern but it's going to take many months and as we know they're going to be here they're going to be\nWell I don't know if you saw Bob I don't know if you saw this but it's important again for people to really understand what's going on and who's behind this we believe I'm obviously there are people in this country who are encouraging it or right before the midterms\nHave civil ... fine but if you look at the two thousand five or ... they were showing it to the two thousand five tape on of on like you said we cannot allow people just to come into this country uh and and violate our laws and\nAnd the president on its way out the president retweeted that yesterday and said I agree with President Obama one hundred percent and where are the Democrats now a sharp Hodgson thank you for the time that blast we appreciate it I have a great day

I don't know what state he thinks he's running for\nBut that was the perfect example like what about school school boards they would sit over us know that overrides it's determining how do you pay people in your district is a school that is a school board or the red star here's how and why we make election endorsements oh good this is by Sarah\nAnd\nThis is\nAt a I Know you're doing your news but what I Want you to pay attention there's a couple of living is is there I Want to hear with Sarah I always want to hear what Sarah has to say well I Want you to keep a straight face so I Want you to keep your dream of wheat\nIn your mouth as you chew it as we speak right now or bagel journalist often operate in the world where we know what we're talking about\nNot anymore\nThere'll be somebody who graduated from College of journalism and knows what they're like Sarah go into the auto mechanic I'm not gonna fall for you need headlight fluid line but I don't understand how it all works and so my car will run so I'm going to answer some of the most asked ... questions in complaints\nNow here's another one\nThis is another one that's just an amazing so we have more access to candidates than the average voter now here's the money line it's our job to pay close attention to what's happening in our communities year round\nSo Sarah appreciate your time on the show hopefully come back so you\nJust said it's the Arizona Daily Star to pay close attention to what's happening in our communities year round so some people out there some jackass is with a\nUm\nWith the radio show would say that I'm you've missed out a bunch of stuff right how dangerous the city of Tucson is now why the roads parks have gone into total decay\nSo\nYeah I guess right right so that's a positive ... looking on the bright side alive ...\nDid not get the Arizona Daily Star so let's give kudos to Sarah and the crew they decided not they could have totally rubber stamped out all the ...\nSo I guess the positive of Layla counts then this other guy is fresh faces but the other guy is Reagan if there is a guy that has two hands in the upper parts of the lower part of the hand puppet\nIt's Adam Reagan I I ... I Hope he comes on and tries to convince me he's not but he is\nThe amount of pictures on crystal fosters Facebook page when she runs an Adam Reagan's their gun\nCrafts still great automatically disqualifies him for anything\nNow there's a shot just on may based on name id right that it's adult leader and ... get back in ... and\nMike is telling me that him and Rachel are trying to meet more on a regular basis but Mike and Rachel have basically blown this opportunity would Stegman over the last couple of years\n\n[noise] and uh so I I keep hearing updates that Mike is trying to work with Rachel and the other way around that they can get some stuff done but again as I told you before if the dynamic stays the same\nAt the U.S the\nRight now the way it as an adult leaders might get back and Mike in racial get back to fighting\nEach other right they get back to doing that\nAnd then at the same time adult leaders there with crystal just sniping from the sidelines\nIt's a slow desperate to you and nothing's ever gonna get done again so now if a whale accounts gets in an ad um Reagan gets him the benefit of that as you're pretty much guaranteed that the U. S. D. will be run into a toilet and\nFast really fast shown I have talked\nAbout Higgins and I've talked about one of them may be the worst things that we ever did that we would have considered an early victory in the show would lead the charge in convincing the city of Tucson and real new wave oh not to build that pathetic giant hotel next to the convention center\nRight could never we brought in Haywood Sanders the professor from Texas yeah and he spoke at the city council and he did a bunch of things that his his his specialty is ah the ... the giant mistakes that cities make that they're going to revitalize their downtown by building something\nRight like a hotel or a convention center and how it's really a lose\nOkay\nNow John I hanging out having a beer in rocky point have said maybe that was one of the worst things we ever did ... and then we'll tell you why if the city of Tucson built a six hundred ... room hotel\nThat would have sat empty lot mhm maybe it would drive the city to bankruptcy and maybe\nThings would have changed a little bit more instead of just living in this zombie like condition that it's now you may be looking out for us that's all you thought this would be the right but when does I don't mean hindsight writes everything twenty twenty and I write what you're saying if you didn't if we didn't and the city of ... and when that thing went belly up hard\nAnd they had this you know spend fifty forty six million dollars for it and sell it for twelve\nThat kind of thing right\nMaybe it would have helped the city have they come to Jesus moment right I don't know but we've had that discussion\nAnd that's the same thing maybe putting Adam Reagan adult leader ... Adam regulate what was going to have to convince me she's going to be different um any of these people um does that drive to USD the toilet faster than the state takes it over or something maybe that's the better than\nMaybe right now again if if if it stays like in his adult leader might get him\nAnd Mike and Rachel can't get over their differences and we live in this zombie like to you is the state all you're doing is making everyone suffer longer\nRight this is you know this is like being on the iron lung in the hospital and you're just kind of living but not really living\nThat is what to you is the what basically become and it might then it comes to an end five years from now maybe it's better that way comes to it at the end and they they they they literally just financially run it right and I my my thing is if I'm segment and that happens I quit\nIf I was staying there if I was stagnant and lay like counseling Adam Reagan got in their hands up go enjoy your family more yeah I wouldn't even waste\nTime with the flag and what did they fight dirty they're going to find what you're going to people yell at you that you're a racist right\nHow do you have bath accountability instead of taking care of the kids know how dare you close your daycare for the rest of the city\nAnd lose at one point three million dollars on how was that a conversation\n\nHow was that a conversation Tio as the under the previous regime opens up day cares for anybody and if there is a place was not going to collect on your a bill that you're running up at the daycare it to you and the\nSo you don't have to be up to you as the parents to use it you don't have to be at the U.S the employee to use it and then you just open for anybody else\nSo statement goes hey we're losing money left and right around here enrollment in the toilet one point three mail it cost to taxpayers and we get you know social justice crap right so so that's why I'm saying maybe it's better that ... just falls\nInto the garbage just do it now just kill it\nUntil you meet to us the story so I'm going to confess right now\nForgive me father for I've certainly seen I'll make it quick so houses for sale right in the middle of town in the middle of the of the jungle okay this is a big story for you to do it is it is a don't tell my wife and I sold it OK\nListening anyone I Know but people go in
