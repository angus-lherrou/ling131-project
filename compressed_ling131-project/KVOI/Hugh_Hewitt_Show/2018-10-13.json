the Nazi invasions ah your ship almost a bomb coming in New York you finally get your what did you do and how did you eventually meet Leonard\nWell my parents and I lived on the west side and I went to the New York public schools my father was in the diamond business\nAnd um he found a beautiful yellow diamond actually on my mother found this yellow diamond then I'm wearing on the street in Nineteen forty seven when I was a little girl and a and those days nobody a value to color down\nBut at any rate he did well and then they went into retailing\nAnd my mother was very very fine sales person she taught me how to sell like all my life\nBecause every once in a while they would always be of someone who was ill and I had to come in and give them the hand after school and um I went to the finest public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college when I was a freshman in college I'm One of my high school friends was dating a real nice fellow by the name of Bob Bob's best friend was a boy by the name of letters laughter\nAnd so Stephanie invited me to a party that her parents were getting and her parents told her that she could have Bob and Bob could bring Leonard if she could get on a date for Leonard\nSo that the four of us could hang around while they were having a party for the grown ups with you know there was thirty people they're\nRich so um my um my first date with Leonard was a blind date that within range by my friend Stephanie and I'm Larry came and picked me up and my dad met him and they talked for a couple of minutes and then we went over to Stephanie's house\nAnd when I got home my father was sitting in the living room which he never did he was usually waiting up to me and that and and so I thought something bad has happened to my mother\nAnd that he was going to give me some bad news and so I said what are you doing in the living room what's happened to mom\nShe said nothing nothing's happening to mom I just want you know that's a nice boy\nWow what am I Am surprised that most of the more you know it was terrible why why getting\nInvolved I mean the only Eighteen oh why didn't need that\nPressure you just to be the dead usually you know he was being done darling I was so I was such a bad thing or would\nYou like to tell you don't go up to you\nKnow now just them revert to and when his mother met me she had the same thing to him and he said oh my God I mean neither one of us were ready for\nA relationship because he was very young and just about to go into the navy and I were just starting college so it wasn't until I graduated and then he\nGot out of the navy that we started today and then I'm\nI'm about a year later we were married and we've known each other really he was my best friend is an important I'm Still surprised that I married him and he still surprised that he married at the house and they're really why is that because we were such good friends and we really liked each other we enjoy talking about\nA variety of topics we never kept our mouth shut and we were always talking about something and\nHe let me a book I never returned to and then she said well I have to marry you if you don't give me that the book\nI said okay the consummate salesman [laughter] let me ask you what was it like when you first met actually well I\nMet her right in the beginning of when I met Leonard and she really was very very nice to me\nAnd she was um she asked me to to help her ... a as a hostess I'm with a surprise birthday party she was going to do for him\nAnd uh she had it at her home and she said she afterwards you know she loved the way I dressed for the party\nThat time and and and she liked the way I really did help her\nA as a house than I introduce people to each other I met people for the first time and um\nYou know and we got along Harry Harry well she was really always good to me\nWhen she into how successful was the motor company to this point how ... was it intimidating the meter was or not that far along in succession\nWell you know very sensitive about that John in fact nobody had ever heard of that the laughter when I met that it was a very small company I Believe they had only started and business a few years earlier had just been the launch of the\nPhenomenal fragrance which became subsequently called youth do which has been a a serious seller for well over fifty years which is longer than most fragrances have lived and um\nYou know she\nOf what I a strict behind the counter after I was married um and people would come up to the counter I the first thing I Would say was have you ever heard of that scene in order and they said well I bet she related to Sarah Halley laughter\nNow I had never heard of sir Harry Potter\nYeah because we're both too young or Harry Potter was the I'm a dance hall artist Scottish\nWho is very very famous in the thirties and forties apparently in England\nAnd I'm In Scotland and many many people knew him here and he was very popular here\nThings kind of change around a little bit yeah [laughter]\nNow they're they're asking Harry's Law sure Harry's or relatives are you related to the exact\nSame now when I go in to a if I if I you know you charge card and people see my name they say are you related to se Lauder so I always say oh I Wish I were I don't want them there and then now

last hours of sleep worries ... friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging much do you remember her telling you these stories are merging and yes\nYes and the beginning I'm One of the great stories that Leonard likes to tell us how the lawyer and they account ... and the friends and family discourage them\nFrom going forward and um so what he says is lawyers make good lawyers

one question is and we got about a minute here before we take a break Evelyn um how did you finally decide to work for the company because I Believe you're a teacher first correct\nI was a teacher and what happened is that I was married and let it and I wanted to start a family right away and I was very fortunate and I was able to conceive quickly and um so about\nTwo months after we were married I discovered that I was pregnant and at that time they wouldn't know vaccines for me\nAnd the doctor said no way that you're going to go back to school\nSo I'm I was very upset because I had never not

Virginia to New Mexico this is American radio journal on this edition\nUnemployment has hit a fifty year low middle class take home pay as up the economy is surging here with a look at the new numbers and the ... what lies ahead is John Tammany of freedomworks\nBrett Kavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court and his confirmation process has energized Republican voters head of the midterm elections Andy robbed of the club for growth is here with the real story\nThe United nations is out with yet another alarmist climate report era vein and run Bailey of reason magazine explore possible policy responses to the report\nOn a hard fought battle over the confirmation of justice Brett Kavanaugh marked a new low in public discourse colonel Frank Ryan us MC retired has an American radio journal commentary [noise]\nI'm Alone and Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe economic good news continued with release of September is unemployment statistics which found the nation's unemployment rate at its lowest level since the Nineteen sixties\nHere he is or through the numbers is John Tammany John ... is director of the center for economic freedom freedom works\nJohn welcome back to American radio journal John the unemployment numbers are out for the month of September and once again it would appear that the economy has yielded a low number of unemployed the lowest perhaps in decades so tell us a little bit about that\nIt's got to be remembered that economies are just people and people naturally grow their naturally trying to better their situation the only way they can is if a natural barriers are putting their place usually at the tax regulatory trade tariffs and an unstable money variety\nAnd so I think it's a fairly strong signal that while President Trump isn't perfect in terms of economic policy\nIn particular on the trade front overall his policies have been rather benign and to some degree pro growth and would that people\nIn the economy just naturally migrated to better and better jobs and and more and more people have come off the sidelines to get to work and so it's very positive sign\nIn terms of the growing economy and job opportunities are we seeing this just in certain groups of people or is this extending across all economic classes and all demographics classes\nEverything that I've read his so far indicated that this is a very deep economic rally Ehsan it's hitting people of at all levels of the economic spectrum from from the high end of earning slow you're hearing about a\nSmaller businesses and or a service businesses that are really struggling to find good workers right now just given given the high demand for them so it's it sounds like it's as is always the case a growing economy you generally lifts all boats and we're seeing that happen right here\nIn terms of these job openings and what appears to be a growing lack of qualified employees is this a factor that could possibly hold this economic expansion down going forward the fact there aren't enough qualified workers out there now for the jobs available\nI don't think so and in my example is myself I come from I guess you'd call generation X. people who graduated in the late eighties throughout the nineties most of us\nDidn't grow up with Internet or anything related to the Internet\nBut my generation adapted to work the Internet based very quickly and that same generation had a lot to do with the Internet boom and so my take is that as it is it's always the case people can learn they learn quickly what they need to learn in order to be employed and and what brings them into employment is that\nCompanies looking to add quality workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay and that serves us\nAll the workers raise the amount that they're willing to pay and that serves as a fairly potent lower so I never worried about bad skills people can develop skills very quickly\nYou mentioned one of the areas where the president maybe is not as free market as other places is when it comes to trade we have a new NAFTA agreement and although I understand you don't have a crystal ball what effect do you think having an agreement actually in place now will have on trade\nWell it's good in the sense that it removes some uncertainty I certainly the markets light picked up probably what they would have liked a lot more is if President Trump hadn't done anything investors broadly like NAFTA and so\nAnd the fact that the good news here is that in bringing it back Trump largely brought back but we had before there was a bit more central planning to it and that's unfortunate there's lots of things like certain cars are going to be made and sold in North America carefree they have to have\nA certain amount of labor constantly sixteen dollars per hour the inputs in the car have to add a percentage of I think Seventy five percent be made\nIn North America all that's unfortunate that the Republican Party has historically been one about free markets and freedom for producers to do is they wished without ... there is a little bit of central planning and the new NAFTA but largely at the same as the one before and investors broadly\nLike that and let's talk for a minute or two now about the Federal Reserve and John many Americans of course in her to the Federal Reserve a lot of folks maybe don't quite understand how it operates in what impact it has a just very briefly what impact does the Federal Reserve actually have on our economy and how does to try to manage it\nWell I'm One of these people and I'm somewhat of an outlier here I've\nLong believed in I wrote a book about it called who needs the fat I I think the feds impact on the economy is vastly overstated the fed exist as a lender of last resort to solvent banks but I Can't really do that you know solving bank would ever go to the fed for a loan it'd be an admission of bankruptcy\nThe fat also regulates banks but I Can't really do that very effectively as two thousand eight reminds us and then of course it aims to set the overnight rate which banks lend to one another button interest rates price like any other you don't need the fat for that and so I think the feds impact has vastly over and people say well you know they're going to\nThat looks at just how quickly we are we're going to hit and surpassed that supposedly crucial one point five degrees Celsius threshold to tell us a little bit about what's in the un report\nWhile the new report is called global warming of one point five degrees centigrade and it was actually part of the process from the Paris Agreement that climate change where the PC said the governmental pedal on climate change\nWas invited or instructed to come up with scenarios what would it be like or what would it take the car from warming by one point five degrees centigrade above pre industrial levels of temperatures\nAnd this report just come out and basically it says that is it has to be a crash program it barked upon now costing\nAt least forty five trillion dollars between now and twenty thirty five where we basically transform the economy from using fossil fuels to almost everything but wind and solar power with energy efficiency on top of it otherwise all kinds of horrible consequences will follow\nWhat should we make Ron of this one point five degrees Celsius threshold how significant is that number is is that actually\nA real tipping point where he's not something that activist to kind of latch onto to use as a as more of a political trend you're here how seriously we take that number and and what sort of things have to be done even just theoretically to to avoid surpassing that's rational\nWorld would would change the the agreement under the Paris climate accord is basically the world to try to avoid going above ... degrees right this is a threat or the county and\nFresh whole as much power just a little bit of background the planet has warmed by about quite nine degrees Celsius but then the report since the early Nineteen centuries\nAnd so they basically trying to say we only has one six degrees Celsius on average temperatures for global average temperatures to grow up before we reached this threshold at one point five degrees Celsius\nWhat they need in order to do that but they calculate is is that we have to cut off you'll use by forty thirty twenty thirty forty five percent\nAnd be a completely ... fuel oil coal and natural gas by twenty fifty that is a huge transformation and those are the parents have questions every second place in the entire history of the world\nThey didn't ... pathways as they call it and how you might achieve that and their their takeaway message is is that initially after that we start spending two point four million dollars per year ... twenty thirty five in order to even get close to doing this\nThat to your background last year the international Energy Agency\nReported that for all energy investment for for years twenty six thing I'm not into one point seven trillion and that was just barely three ... three hundred billion in renewable so what they're calling for is essentially scaly have extended his or her new book like ten pounds or prevent that\nAnd and look if if we could stop using dirty fossil fuels tomorrow with with no negative consequences it All right if we can just shut them off and replace them all was green energy tomorrow I think everybody would be fine with that I don't think anybody is really committed to fossil fuels as I as a concept right\nBut the reality is that there are serious economic consequences to making this transition because\nFossil fuels are are cheaper and more plentiful than most of the alternatives that we have we're talking with Ron Bailey he's the science correspondent for\nReason magazine and the author of the book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century around just about a minute or so left here but let's I I'm just curious for your thoughts on let's assume that that manmade global warming is actually a real thing what is the proper way to combat it in your mind\nA slow gradual weaning away from fossil fuels over time there are ways of doing it in their losses pathways through it and let them pay for things to do with the figure out how to invest\nIn development to come up with the global energy sources that are in fact cheaper to ... but one of the interesting things I found is that there is a scalable energy technologies that says her could hurting what their goals are and that is where our basically dismiss it\nAnd I find that very puzzling because we know that we are the technically feasible and yet they just\nGo round like this are complicated personally when I got to think about that because there was that we wanted to do is talk of last year or so to have solar panels and and wind generation when mills what you want to do was to create and horses that kind of outcome you know if you do that the problem though\nYeah of course now compete them without having to spend lots of subsidies and tax credits and all of that on those uh those other forms we are unfortunately were not there yet Ron Bailey from read the magazine thanks so much for taking some time to be here today the rise again\nAnd again that is Ron bally's and science correspondent for reason magazine you can check out his latest piece for us at reason dot com how big of a deal is an extra half of degree of global warming find that again reason dot com\nCheck out his book the end of doom environmental renewal and the twenty first century as well you can find that on Amazon or read the magazine I married name we will catch you right back here next week on another edition of American radio journal\nCivility was the biggest casualty of the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings on this American radio journal commentary colonel Frank Ryan us embassy retired says it's time for elected officials to begin acting more like a statesman\nMonth to extraordinarily different yet related events played out in the American landscape one was the headline where's the other was just a footnote\nTo first event the confirmation process for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh exploded infuriating the American media and the public discourse to second event was the announcement of the ... the medal of honor\nTo sergeant major John Kennedy for his heroism in Vietnam decades earlier I was honored to receive an invitation to the sergeant majors award ceremony from my sergeant major Eddie nice the medal of honor is bestowed on those individuals\nWho I quote conspicuously by downed tree and interpreted the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty unquote surf was self sacrifice and without regard to their own life\nFor every American respects the medal of honor and a significant self sacrifice\nThat the award conveys it is this concept of self sacrifice while reviewed\nHis missing some noticeably from our society today I'm certain that are selfish preoccupation was instantaneous gratification has caused many of the problems we as a society face some major can we fought valiantly in the battlefield to Vietnam\nAnd is finally being recognized for self sacrifice and devotion to duty his personal bravery serves as an example of what leadership is all about and reflects Greek credit upon himself\nHis unit the United States Marine corps and the naval services on the other hand the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh was the epitome of some of the most disgraceful conduct\nEvery exhibited by the United states senators in the history of our nation while associate justice Kavanaugh did Nazis bullets emitted death he was most certainly assaulted in most defensive ways possible by those who are supposed to support and defend the constitution of the United states of America there was very ...\nSince the constitution of the United states of America those very senators knew all too well the judge was not protected against defamation because of the case of the New York times versus solving in other words politicians in public figures\nHave little recourse to slanderous conducted less actual ... says proven it is an almost impossible standard to prove which means that the judge by accepting the nomination to the court\nHad to be willing to subject himself and his family to horrific conduct by those opposed to his views\nIf a nation is ever going to attempt to rebuild itself to very character of the nation must emphasize selflessness a moral code of decency and personal responsibility our national character as represented by great heroes like sergeant major can really is under assault\nThis battle was more than just the battle for Supreme Court nomination is about the very struggle for survival with the freedoms that we use cells in the bill of rights and for which sergeant major Kennedy and millions of others fought over in the military and government take the same oath of office to support and defend\nThe constitution of the United states of America the conduct of the senators attacking Kavanaugh on here say in your window for political gain was disgraceful\nThose senators victimized justice Kevin ... Dr Ford and all of us for political gain\nIn a different type of battle equally as important when justice Kavanaugh fought to protect the very fabric of the constitution yes sworn to defend by not backing down he convinced me up his moral courage the face of unwavering criticism\nOr the primary underpinnings in any civilized societies the presumption of innocence this nonsense that presumption of innocence did not apply because it was a job interview is a travesty is a travesty inflicted by the opposing side of the very character\nOf a person and our nation it was a sad day for our entire nation and those of us who fought\nTo defend this nation and our constitution\nYour bill of rights and common law to shoot the city of their arguments fell on deaf ears of those of us who had to defend while in the military the character of our nation and our people elected leaders of which I Am now one have a responsibility to be statesmen first\nAnd politicians second the travesty the conduct of those opposing Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court cast shame and dishonor on the institution which they were elected to serve\nFortunately others in the Senate stripped from\nAnd upheld the suicidal framework of the presumption of innocence those brave senators was tremendous pressure to conform to very precepts of the constitution that they had been sworn to uphold when a nation centered citizens into combat and into the military\nHas a moral responsibility to support and defend that same constitution the military supported in harm's way where's elected the leaders are obligated to support the constitution and the halls of Congress in both arenas are critical if our nation is to survive only through our emphasis on self sacrifice moral courage\nLost in the world of cyberspace they have personalized objects and totally subject devised reality\nThey have personalized objects and totally subject devised reality it is not at all uncommon on a given night\nFor a young man or a young woman to be in France before a machine B a computer or a television set where we can get idiot dies night after night\nAnd she used to think clearly anymore but the young person is more engaged with reality through a books than with people and ideas and relationships it's a fearsome thing right there are some\nMy son is a ... he's always pressing buttons and even when we're having lunch or slow this you know and I'm trying to talk to him and I say who are you talking to I Hope you're not in the audience because I wanted to talk to you and tells you stop talking to my son while I'm having\nLunch with him [noise]\nOr just this kind of sorry dad sorry dad but it's always something very\nInnocuous or just checking discourse checking whether the Braves won or not I could have told him that before he checked it [noise]\nThis kind of stuff that goes on again and again and again but it takes Henri serious over to them is very serious here is not uncommon to talk to her father and mother who says\nOur kids have cut us off from their lives we don't hear from them anymore where passe but does and I had somebody recently said to me I don't know when this all happened so I don't know when this happened to my son\nAnd the whole reality then is in turn allies subject devised\nIt is what is called philosophically a ... universe where you are the only ultimate reality that matters and you're feeding off the inside there's no objective personal reality out there\nThis is the kind of world in which we live\nNow how did all of this come about I have traced it\nInto the following sequins but I Want to put it side by side with the biblical narrative okay so let me give you six initial ideas that represented in the scriptures and see when you look at this holy scriptures there are three words that begins the story\nBut I have bought a fellow came\nVery she's about Ella came in the beginning God created\nIn the English language we have five words in the Hebrew language we have three words but she is but I ... everything from the hangs on those three words in the beginning God created it is not accidental than\nNatural is one good to kill all of the narrative often that by taking on the first three words because they knew the importance of the bag you can somehow explain humanity away as a random call location of atoms from primordial slime\nHere we are as thinking atoms and somehow talking morality and metaphysics and all of that that we are hill with\nNo ... no ... no ultimate\nPurpose that we just happen to be on the scene imagine that thing called the implications of that if it is true\nIf it were actually true\nThat no person no moral framework governed your existence\nNot at all surprising that or to become a very lonely planet\nI remember talking to a journalist to New York times he weeks ago when he wanted to do an interview with me and what's happening in our church is on the heels of this economic crisis\nAnd I said to him do mind served before you ask me questions I asked her just one he was kind of humor to buy it I said really I'd like to ask you one because you're a journalist from the New York times\nI said all these decades and our Ivy League schools we trained our MBA graduate seminar for last summer's to believe morality was relative\nThat there are no absolutes that there's really no argument right and wrong you have to determine what is right and wrong now when they become the head of Enron and banks and insurance companies and believed what they were taught and breakfast or relativistic ethic we put them behind bars\nWhy are we imprisoning them for believing that professors\nDon't you think we ought to be trying that professors as well silence [noise]\n\nSilence this distant junction between assumption and practice is this is that make breaking point about culture today you know what's happening in our culture today I was showing this to friends last night a dinner\nI'm a very wealthy man actually you may not know this but I have in my wallet an authentic one hundred million dollar bill\nAnd I carry ... you know why it comes from Zimbabwe\n[noise] and it takes fire [noise]\nThey're printing money they every three months one hundred million dollars probably bought me a loaf of bread because the inflation rate is five hundred ... percent clear I don't know what that means I just started on the news\n[noise]\nFive hundred couldn't tell him percent per year where prices are doubling every thirty one hours that I Know what's happened in the economy we were spending money we never had the boring money without any guaranteed to ever get it back\nWe bought loaning money to people who did not have the capacity to return it this will not done with one or two it was done with millionaires and it became payday some day and there was nothing to be paid what happens in currency happens in morality\nYou cannot live off capital you don't have you will become a spendthrift from an account that is not there and sooner or later you will to end up with moral bankruptcy\nAnd so on television executive who phones the station to give up a better view of Islam than the westerners ends up splitting the\nThroat of his wife because she was going to leave in wonderful solution isn't it\nThere's going to leave him wonderful solution isn't it\nYou can't spend what you don't have and what is it God intended for us to have here the six points the first thing is God made an announcement in the book of genesis and God said\nGod's assumption in the narrative is that is a speaking God he's communicating God he's not a silent God he is and he is not ...\nThat is a starting point all of the book of genesis and God said\nIf you believe but I have but I Do have in the beginning God you also believe he's a communicating God he's a revealing God there's an announcement secondly there is a monument\nLet there be let there be and God is replacing chaos and darkness with water and design have you read any of the books on spirituality recently you talk about one confusing\nMess of propagate ers\nDon't waste your money and buying beep a children's book on the ...
