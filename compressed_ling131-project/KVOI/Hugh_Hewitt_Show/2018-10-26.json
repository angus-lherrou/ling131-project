rhetoric let's remember we\nHave a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he his kind of guy\nIt's hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility

and November\nWell I I see the ongoing wake for the J. C. P. R. A. everywhere at Ben Rhodes um I I like to call them the met her neck of the network I work for MSNBC the ... commandments it'd be the is always quick to blast during the president for alienating the world and walk away from the J CPA and putting the fact China and Russia have\nIt's like an Alice in wonderland foreign policy Mr Secretary how much time do you have to defend do have to spend defending doing obviously\nA necessary steps against the fantasy land foreign policy fantasy foreign policy lead but they got going over there\nI don't spend much time thinking about Ben Rhodes\nUm I spend a lot of time thinking about making sure that America is secure in our interests are protected\nUh is very missile launches that you described that ... that you spoke to the export of malign influence around the world all took place\nDuring the J CPA away and indeed in nearly every instance that I just prefer to increased or during the time of the J CPA was bad for\nThe United states or the right decision was made by the president to withdraw and our ask of a rod is just to simply become a normal country stop exporting terrorist stop using proxy forces to create chaos around the world and then we will welcome them back into the league of nations and we're just waiting on them to do that\nI Am counting on a week from Tuesday being a referendum on that as well as China and then finally not as well known but governor Rick Scott with my guests this morning he tells me that Venezuelan ex pats and the Nicaraguan ex pats in Florida with whom he is campaigning and talking and helping in the aftermath of Michael\nAre still amazed that we allowed ... to do what he did over the last ten years to their country what is our current policy and Hama line and influence easy\nSo my daughter has a behaving the way that dictators do and imposed enormous personal anguish on Venezuela's we now have several million Venezuelans who have fled their country largely for Columbia but now to other places in South America as well\nU.S policy is very clear we are supporting a return to democratic process as Venezuela and we have put\nSignificant sanctions on the Venezuelan\nA leadership in order to urge them to allow democracy to return so that once again but it's really a country that has tremendous capacity oil other natural resources to be a successful thriving democratic nation that contributes to the world's um accumulated wealth returns to a country of that nature\nNow very soon Brazil will be out of a period of political instability they'll have a new president he has a a ...\nA man of the right and then you on Colombia and Brazil with renewed political leadership do you think that between those two and with helping inspiration from the United states something can be done about the collapse and then as well because people are suffering in an extraordinary way there\nYou you mentioned that Israel and Nicaragua together I Do think that the alignment of the new leaders in South America and Central America\nAre determined to see these nations that are amongst them their neighbors behaving in ways the aesthetic all to the well being being of their own people give us the opportunity to change the course and direction of those two countries\n[laughter] a couple of questions brags it it just seems to me that the EU as being a irrational here Mr Secretary\nAnd may force I even fair revival the troubles in Northern Ireland for not care careful do are you involved in trying to bring the u._k. and the EU together to a rational and point of this or the separation this divorce\nThe discussion between you and Britain are we we are very hopeful they will continue to have conversations that will lead to an outcome that's good for both entities\nAnd the last question goes to the United nations we've got a bacon see there and I'm sure you'll find the right person but I've never been a fan of having the ambassador in the cabinet and who's always seemed to me to be a mixed message about line of command has any decision been made about that\nThat'll be that'll be the president's decision both with respect to whether it'll be a cabinet member and he'll be lots of work has been done in that regard and I'm confident that we'll get a very good outcome one that allows America to be represented in a a fantastic way from the United nations\nAnd you used to meet with the president daily Mr Secretary how now you're on the road what how much time you get to spend and talk with him about the world as it is and how it's operating\nA quite a bit um I I certainly don't see him each day in the same way I did it in my previous role but I certainly talk to him every day and I'll even be over there today in the middle of
