twenty six camouflage is a scheme\nAs a scheme of big business and and and large corporations who\nPut it on the ballot well there are still the best part is you would say oh it's something about taxes on on ... Rao let's got tired of say you know out some like chamber of commerce thing or whatever is not\nThis is a realtor is the Arizona realtors says now the national association of realtors already gotten this done in Missouri\nThey did and and you know this is something taxes on services don't even exist okay we're not taxing services you know as it stands now but air for a few years is or every\nYou know so often they will pop up and say well we're going to put a tax on these services and so this is the\nPerfect opportunity for Arizona says they passed or for the realtors just to say well let's see if we can get past year we got passed in Missouri\nUh there was the big scare with the red bread and and funding of education and the governor's big plan and how he's going to get all this money to pay for it right you know it pop back up again and so now they're they put forth a lot of money in this election too to see that it pass\nA one time one twenty six for\nYou know it changes the constitution cherry picks businesses certain businesses to succeed and certain business\nBusinesses to fail\nYeah not fail work harder you know um it's um\nIt's a creation of big government and special interest is ah it's camouflaged under you know not taxing certain businesses\nBut it it what it does is it just shift the burden for one business to another and by putting it in the in the constitution\nIt means we cannot fix it later we can't tweak it later it we can't say oh my goodness we you know our economy is always changing it's always in flocks and we always need to adjust last more\nWhatever the case may be and once it's in the constitution we can't do that anymore\nYeah I ... and previous tax policy by proposition I've always been against the reason\nIs because it basically it's a men's mhm tying the hands of the future legislature to try to figure out how to pay for some bills and you're right it does create the people who sell goods are now being chosen I'm assuming the people who have services are now being chosen over the ones that\nThere's a lot of service businesses to that don't actually fit into that\nCat on a lot of tax guy all I'm neither of us are tax\nMoney should be fighting for equal tax across fair tax across the board a attacks reformation that is what what state really need we need to redo the tax code completely putting this in the constitution pies are hands we can no longer do that because certain businesses are already in there so we can't\n... to shift to but it's certainly and then when government needs money will happen is they'll just find the places that they can tax you and hit it harder it is so if you want to go hit sales taxes more overall on goods\nThey'll hit of even harder as good or your property taxes or the or come to a point where people who don't even have property taxes might start having property taxes\nKnow so half position one twenty five is the perfect example of what's going to happen with one twenty six you know in Nineteen Ninety eight the reason why we're doing one twenty five now is because we can't adjust the um the pay the pension pace and why can't the legislators fix it because it was put in the constitution\nAnd why can't the legislators fix it because it was put in the constitution in Nineteen Ninety eight correct and so they the courts keep saying you can't do it it's unconstitutional we have to go back to the ballots to even fix something that needs\nAnd the Syrian about one twenty five of course is that a big group the a ... of the correctional officers in there with it says elected officials mhm a lot of that just irritates me All right so what's gonna happen is\nThere is a good chance that it might go down even though there is no side really pushing it hard one way or the other because they'll say oh pensions of elected officials know mhm\nYou know for me I'm a big fan as I started thinking about that one I've seen it on the ... I don't want pension for elected officials I don't think I should have a\nI don't either that's promoting they may be grandfathered they should be there too long yeah especially if you're saying it creates it creates a career right\nOut of a job that's only supposed to be temporary so other people can come in and so we can have the flux of the people's voice\nThat's my next proposition is limited pensions for elected officials\nAre we in his grandpa out in the states walk themselves then they create the loopholes for themselves right you know there's so many examples of that is just crazy\nSo okay so you and I agree on the ...\nIt's a no one one twenty so\nIt is such a no one twenty six it's just crazy\nNow what other things about one twenty six that you'd like to share with the audience before I let you go of what else further bothers you about one twenty six\nWell again I I think the main things that we need to focus on is that cherry pick certain businesses and government should be getting out of the way up all business and letting capitalism\nI'm sorted outlet to consumers sorted out as to which ones they want to succeed and not succeed which ones um they want to give their business to and not\nBy cherry picking these businesses and saying these are exempt from taxes forever for the burden on others to pick up the slack the taxes taxes are\nImportant we have to have a certain amount to ... to find our society we have to write but we can't put the burden all on just a few people\nI'm trying to finally yes on if they're even if even if the if there is a yes I'm older as I just wanted to see who they ah they have is the uh\nUh well there's my district there's the the legislators are I'm pushing for the Republican legislators are pushing for it [noise]\nOh yeah it's a scale Griffin alright ... and she's a big supporter of it she thinks it you know and she says that you know you can't trust the legislators to stop taxing and so this is a way to at least stop taxing a certain area and keep it low um\nIt's I don't agree and you know I I disagree with it the supporters like to say that it shielding the service sector from sales tax because it keeps popping up and and if we get a Democrat majority they're gonna raise the taxes more\nYou know what I'm looking for is I'm looking for supporters and it doesn't come up on the ... the thing that's a supporters but I Can't\nIt doesn't actually taught me up to a supporter page so so so basically what they're saying is the people who want this which are the real truth who started this on the first place is that anything that you have a service right so they have we got a um\nThe mail or that came out I don't know if I still have it it has the senior citizen female whether dog at the vet and it says", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "16"}
