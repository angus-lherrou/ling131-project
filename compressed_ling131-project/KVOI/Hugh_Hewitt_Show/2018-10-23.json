Holman of the fair which is the federation for American immigration reform will join us to talk about this caravan ended up as well but I Want to get you in at eight hundred five to zero one two three four specifically to answer this question\nTo what links do you believe the president of the United states should go in order to stop this caravan of thousands from coming to the United states using a bogus claim of asylum which is all they have to do is use the right language and they've all been coached to know what that languages\nTo claim persecution are based on their race race or their ethnicity or sexual orientation or whatever the case might be and then of course knowing\nThe outrage that was expressed by the left\nOne the last caravan came through in these people are made these claims were then held in family centers detention centers if you want to call them that housing centers some parents were separated from their kids because kids can't be held in the same facilities with adults\nAnd all the nonsense that we saw by the way even if we didn't want to use those now we can't because there for all\nThese people are then going to be released with a simple wink and a nod saying come back soon for your asylum hearing\nAnd then when they are released as we know eighty to Ninety percent of them do not come back for their hearings they disappear into the ether they disappear into the continental United States not stopping in the border states\nThey're coming up to date the coming up to Ohio gonna Pennsylvania the going throughout the northeastern going quite frankly all over the country and what are they doing when they get there when you heard the man in the clip that I played previously they're taking jobs\nThey're taking jobs they're using resources there using educational resources health care resources and so on and so forth and then they're sending the money that they earn back repatriating those dollars to their families are waiting them over are back in Honduras\nOr El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that they're coming from\nThat's what their goal is you're still to what links do you think the president should do in order\nTo stop this are we talking a full militarized border are we talking about tanks on our side are we talking about\nSoldiers in troops in guardsman locked arm in arm saying you're not coming through you're not getting to the port of entry to make your claims what should the president do\nBecause in an interview aboard air force one yesterday the president made clear there is no limit to the number of troops he is willing to stand at the border to stop this caravan\nHe previously vowed to send the military as opposed to the national guard to confront this group which the un now says over Seventy two hundred members strongest started with about a thousand\nNow it's over seven thousand it's organized this isn't just you know legitimate grass roots are just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump\nThey're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed they're giving

violent acts I don't know that we can just turn around and start committing violent acts here's the reason I ask what you did down there I wondered\nIf somebody could give me an idea of what life is actually like in Honduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described\nA much to the outrage of the laugh you know one of the black hole countries it's third world it's impoverished we understand that but that does not give people in those impoverished third world countries no right to just circumvent us immigration law\nViolate our sovereignty and and pour into this country on a beta it cannot happen we cannot be the world's dumping ground for all of the rest of the world's problems\nAs it pertains to asylum this part as important as well and I and and I want people their standards three basic requirements for asylum first and asylum applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country second they have to prove that they would be persecuted if they go back\nOn account of one of five protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or social group\nIn other words a Honduran migrant or invader coming to the border\nOf the United states after plowing through a Guatemala and plowing through Mexico and getting to our border they wouldn't have to say if I go back to Honduras they're going to persecute me on the base of my race\nWeight you're Honduran on the base of my religion what religion are you going to be persecuted in Honduras my nationality again you're Honduran my political opinion or my ...\nParticipation in a social group in third the applicant must establish that it's the government of Honduras that is persecuting for said things\nNow we just heard from one of the migrant or we have one of the migrant caravan ah members in that piece that I played last hour from Fox and you heard what he's saying is that why you why do you want to come to the United states and you work with he said jobs\nWe want to come to work well that's that's not fleeing persecution which\nWhen they go to the United states port of entry they're going to lie and say I'm being persecuted when the reality is they just want to come to the United states take jobs from Americans or from illegal immigrants to the United states\nTake jobs from Americans or from illegal immigrants to the United states and then repatriate the dollars they are in those jobs back to their country\nThat cannot happen\nThat as a violation of American sovereignty there is no two ways about it let's go to Houston Lucas look yes you're on the Hugh Hewitt show where you at the rally last night in Houston\n\nWith my father in law and my family\nSo you know where that ... that is fantastic can you tell me something\nCan you give me an idea and I know you didn't call about this but I have to ask you can you give me an idea of how many people how many thousands of people were still outside that venue a and and could not get in but wanted to stay in sharing support the president and Senator Cruz\nNumbers wise I cannot say but I Know all of downtown where shut down because no cars could drive through because of the amount of people still outside trying to get in and just trying to celebrate freedom\nThe president's ah estimate from his team was around twenty five thousand people outside the venue but your police chief down their heart Acevedo said ah maybe three thousand people\n[laughter] no I think it was probably more like ten to Fifteen I mean all all the roads were shut down all around us\nAnd I know they they try to minimize the president's impact of the fact that they do that all the time and I know what I mean it was a very very liberal a sheriff down there and uh I Know what he stands for but at any rate what'd you call about\nSo I mean I I'm a marine and I feel that just because a government our government says one thing that that might be or not that's for the people I thought for this country I didn't fight\nTo a sit back and watch our country being invaded we've already made\nCertain understanding that they're not being there not leaving on doors because the prosecution they're leaping because they want what we have well we fought for what we have enough they're not ready to grab a gun and I feel that they want then they can sit back and kill all we can sit back and just do it needs to get done the problem today is is we don't drink a cold beer out of the death\nOf a school of our enemy that we thought we'd all but\nDead bodies on a wall to let people know that you don't come in here\nWe are a great country and we're only great because we fought for we're walking to someone else's country and take it\nAnd that's what they're doing they're not coming here because they need help coming here because they want what we have we need to stand up and fight what we happy we all lose that just because the government just because Trump or the Democrats or Republicans doesn't matter or country of one we all need to stand up together as one and fight back that back and just\nHope it got it doesn't affect us in our little out wherever we

on and just be moments he was a member of the United states commission on civil rights and uh he should be joining us shortly but apparently again we're having a phone number issue here so hopefully we can get that connected or sooner rather than later\nI'm so also coming up at the bottom of the hours we talk more about this caravan that is a steam rolling he is there okay good we'll get to him

small engine equipment to keep it running strong\nGet more information that look before you pump dot com\n[noise]\nTwenty two minutes after the hours we continue our friends sitting in for Hugh Hewitt this morning and the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer\nAnd beautiful Cleveland, Ohio Peter cursing our is with us Peter as a member of the United states commission on civil rights and we're talking about the migrant caravan though a gallery of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it all Peter\nThe president said in an interview on air force one yesterday there is no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he repeated that last night or disadvantage Houston for Ted Cruz he has the plant a re power\nTo deny anybody admission to the United states as long as he deems it in the interest of the United states this is granted him by the uh immigration and nationality act in Nineteen fifty to\nThe question is this how far do you think he is willing to go and how far should he be willing to go in order to literally physically militarized that border with troops with tanks with ... with whatever's in order to stop these migrants from getting to the port of entry where they can dust then make their asylum claims\n[noise] well I think he's willing to go as far as he can go under the law I have absolutely no doubt a huge motivation and use determination to do that as opposed to slow the president's\nHowever there is a you know eat a certain conflict in terms of the law yeah and it has been completely educated as far as the terms of how far can go we've got some historical perspective as to how far we can go but although he's got the right I think he was just going to get it and we discuss this ... asked\nTo do my classes of aliens entry into the United states and that sort of political right\nMeans by which he does that is subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the military domestically or the policy kind of taught us act\nNow works exceptions to that and has them fully litigated is to the extent of the president's power in terms of using um [noise] uh troops to do that\nWith the president can do for example is he can ask state to to you I'm a deployed the national guard you condense federalize the national guard troops but if you federalized with them again he comes up against the policy kind of hard to say now what they can do\nIs engaging non law enforcement act that is at as a deterrent but they can't easily equipment or vehicles that can't stop and frisk you can't sue individual\nWrecked as law enforcement or you know a law enforcement has to be but there are at least some with may change there are exceptions to that and let the president might have the ability to have a two two quest that the national\nRetain their steep status and then there are there any potentially use them in active use if uh it's deemed necessary to do so but there's there was a real gray area in terms of law now\nSetting that aside as to whether or not there was affected by which we use federalize National Guard or army troops or even state National Guard\nTroops to do engage in the kind of introduction activity\nThe president of the army there or or a troops there\nActs as a truck and as a back to back stuff now you may recall that earlier in the year the president said that he was going to send down there and support and to do with just typical assistance to free up the border patrol in others to engage in the border\nAnd activities and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty resorted to do that that's without question\nUh there was a real question as to whether or not you know some would say well the this so called caravan that's coming in who knows how large by the time it reaches order is not really an invading force per se or it doesn't have weapons but at what point does it become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue its own radio threat to national security looked at several thousand that are a threat to national security for Fifteen thousand what about if it rises level what we saw in Europe where it's tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nIf it's on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is at fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago went from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now because there's still a thousand miles away Pete where we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered in reading for sufficient which includes a justified to use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think\nThat in the first instance across the United states as the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for\nThe border that may not include the law enforcement but at the turn of the border is\nAnd that it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us twenty seven minutes after the hour by friends sitting in for here he went right back after\nFortunes of the Hugh Hewitt show or march you buy alliance defending freedom [noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action pack

[noise]\n[noise] Vicky how you doing how's the knee it's coming along Dr Pepper still some ... let's see you know this soon after surgery some pain is pretty normal I was hoping to get more pain killers the first round works crate we're being very careful with those now\nYeah for example we have our our credible fear standard what these people do is I think everybody can agree\nThat that these migrants coming up they're not refugees they're not asylum their economic migrants listen if they're saying they're fleeing some violence in Honduras\nGuatemala or El Salvador and they cross into Mexico I think everybody can agree that Mexico is a safer environment than where they're coming from so you're automatically not a refugee anymore but what happens is when you come to our border\nYou come to a port of entry again this is why a border wall and itself cannot solve everything because you just they these people just go to a port of entry and they claim credible fear they say I have a credible fear of returning to my homeland\nAnd that's the initial basis for an asylum claim and and we we approve those credible fear claims and math so when they say I claim credible fear then they get an appointment before an immigration judge\nTo women ... or ... let me interrupt for a second to clarify something\nIt's it's my understanding that that credible fear has to be on the grounds of one of five protected grounds who central race religion nationality political opinion or particular social group\nNone of these people are ... they're all Honduras so it can't be rising nationality is the religion I I I unless they're claiming their Muslim and they're they're being discriminated against in a largely Christian population which I don't know that they are political opinion or public particular social group they don't have any book where you're writing on those grounds\nYou're right but but you remember just look how organized this caravan is these people are coached\nTheir coach they know exactly what to say when they get there to fall under that credible fear determination and a lot of the times works you know these people are getting approved enlarged numbers they were approved and a lot larger numbers in the Obama administration but they still are and that's just the initial German determination\nSo they come in they get released into the interior of the country or asylum backlog is massive it's I think it's around five hundred thousand\nSometimes it can take years for their claimed to be heard so they get released into the country in some cases even get work permits employment authorization documents\nSo that's what they want they know that can happen and a lotta times again they just disappear so Congress needs to tighten our credible fear\nStandards and again with these family units in ... in our law right now um Mexicans are the only people that can be properly deported\nAgain Central Americans can't be promptly repatriated at the TV PR a loophole it's called our listener asylum system is is riddled with loopholes I mean those are the main pull factors for people to come here and as long as Congress just just sits on their hand that doesn't do anything these caravans will still\nCome and keep happening and again President Trump's talking about the border wall securing funding in December but a border wall will not do much good overall with this current crisis we have in less those loopholes are also close\nOr ... helped me out help me understand this it was reported yesterday that are on Fox that the Mexican government has offered asylum to these people\nUm if that is the case we don't have to repatriate them back to Honduras or run a mile or El Salvador we can repeat your patriot them back to Mexico there are no longer in fear of persecution from their governments\nIf we're not sending back to them back to their governments were sending them to the country that well actually we're just saying stay in the country or in right now you have been granted am not asylum at amnesty by the Mexican government\nTherefore your claim of persecution by the hundreds government holds no water\nYeah I'm I'm that we're not clear how it's exactly working out with what the Mexicans are doing in one in one instance I saw it as well that when they reached a certain area in Mexico Mexican authorities were right they're offering them an opportunity to claim asylum and then the care of and blue right past them\nAgain so it it it's unclear kind of how that would be treated when they do get here but again as you mentioned\nYes these people are no the fact that they entered in a safe third country they entered into Mexico shows that they are no longer fleeing violence are not willing to stay right where they are in it we can all agree is markedly safer situation\nSo if that's the case then I mean how how do we why do we have to then go on through the process of allowing them into the United states or is that what you're calling for you know our job when you're talking about let's bring everybody back in the campaign trail and vote on this can we do if language does not exist in our laws they maybe that's why we need to write in that if you have been granted\nIf you've been granted amnesty or asylum by a third party country here than your claim of asylum in the United states is no longer about\nRight now that's called a safe third touchy agreement again too and that would that that is something that needs to be that done with Mexico and it's something that but again those people have to be interacting with the Mexican authorities NAFTA actually interact with them rather than blowing past them and just continue on to our border I mean they have to if they have to enter right process if you will but again\nThis is just something that Congress needs to rectify I Know President Trump is working his tail off on this issue and and and he wants to stop this caravan but again in ... in some areas the administration's hands are tied again you see what the travel ban it anything that's administration does on immigration ending DACA though there are things like that\nThey get into these open borders groups forum shop they go find an activist judge who who doesn't who doesn't care about our sovereignty\nAnd then they get their ruling that they want the administration can't can't they can't act\nOn on our national security it's simply ridiculous that's why Congress needs to act and if Democrats want to obstruct and they should do that in front of the American people and let them decide\nAre you familiar with the Merida Initiative and if so what what what good does it do to have this odd but not familiar with that ...\nIt's ... it's also called plan Mexico a it's a security cooperation between the U.S Mexico and the countries of Central America in which they're all agree to essentially not allowed to have happened what's happening right now and uh obviously music is playing so we can't get that answer an emerging next time around thank you so much for your time today\nAre Jane Harman is the director of government relations for federation of Americans for

I don't even know this stuff is happening because I'm looking at Facebook any by now sucks sake book sucks I'm with you and if that's the only place you can go and beat up on people had correct than than you are really all that and for\nAll of you who are crying on Facebook about Martin right even you know I I ...\nThere's some good stories that Loretta does that Arizona Bailey independent but now I have this uh thing Napier alternative the operation stone garden raises questions about okay that's not that's fair but what I'm saying is some of these other people say oh we've surrender to stop\nThis guy do his thing maybe you should read\nWhat is this guy do his thing\nMaybe you should read the words he says when\nHe was on when he was on the show\nOkay All right\nSo ... so here's the thing so it may be a puts on his Facebook page\nA he's grilling currently Assad to look like and he's got a beer and it said I had a tough week actually um this is from Sunday ... literally Loretta puts it in the Arizona daily independence as comfort food staking beer provide sustenance for the inexperience sheriff mark Napier stop it\n[noise] well yeah 'cause nine of us was such a great\nRepublicans stop eating each other I'm sick of it do you know how hard it is to work against this machine\nDo you understand how hard it is to work against this machine for the law that that's been festering and growing like a cancer for Thirty years this machine\nWe just talked about this thing what Joe was on yesterday you're on the line right and\nWhat happens is those in power are giving short cuts others on the line where everyone else can go right on the line\nSo here's the thing Republicans we know\nAnd I've said it before and a lot of you agree with me no on it's a hell no on\nFour sixty three right because three people and they're they're overpaid employee ... just don't want to fix roads it's a weird\nStrategy and Chuck's brain and the other three fall along with it is let everything fall apart and asking for more money and no one's going to demand accountability from I'm\nSure as hell not the business community or Democrats or the paper right\nNow was asking for accountability so I I said it's a tad Maxwell yesterday I'll say it again I said it to window long when he was on talking about four sixty three the\nOnly way to fix the roads is the get break up the three dams on the Pima County board of soups\nThat well if we're going to eat each other\nIf I have Republicans going after the only county line elected official Republican\nWhere are we going here\nAnd we're going to do anything to break up the party I\nNeed the alley Miller crew and the Steve Christie crew the put a little bit of their crap aside not run people against them because we need every damn dime to break up to three D's\nBecause if you don't believe that this is the best for I Know you guys it's so easy\nI've been doing this for nine years I got it\n\nBlog you just you you you you're on you hit Fox News Wall Street journal Breitbart kind of stuff right they're going to feed you every white right wing piece of crap humanly possible and your feet and then our friends on the left you hit a New York times you hit a block\nOr whatever this is what you're going to get a Washington Post they're going to feed you left wing crap so when I went to the civility ... Adriana and I went to the civility event at the loft right and then we had Carolyn Lukens Myer from the civility folks on a month or so later right and\nSo I'm listening to ... from the you have a talk about um how did we get here right and she brought up these algorithms right 'cause we're creating these digital um echo chambers\nRight and we're all walking around with our phone in our face stroking it like the ring of power from the lord of the rings\nGoing and I was writing things are a face all the time you're on board your your board on on line at the bank you're driving you're bored whenever you're\nLooking at these dumb phones okay and they are feeding you more and more of the stuff you're clicking on now Facebook was smart which they're not sometimes they would give you a button you could click to give me both sides are just the opposite side\nWhen it came to politics okay\nBut there was a button that gave me both sides fifty fifty that would be amazing\nBut we don't but\nWhat's happening is so that the civility Institute stepped in themselves right and I told us the Carolyn on the air they did an event only with Jonathan Rauch child they only advertise on Arizona Public media and the Tucson weekly and they had it at the loft\nOkay do you know what they created by doing all of that an echo chamber exactly right so I said the ... when I go if you really want to do civility right\nPut something more on the north side of town closer to the foot hills that's where the event would be right and have alley Miller and sharing Bronson at the same one you want to talk of civility let's rock\nAll right so\nWhen I see this stuff when I see Republicans trying to eat Republicans\nThe guy who might be the best most qualified sheriff we've had in Thirty years\nBecause\nHe's got to play a game with these guys because he wasn't a point of view and and you guys have no idea what other things he's working on\nThe tried to make this happen so grow the freak up people grow up\nLet's go to Carl in line to seven nine zero twenty forty Carl what's up buddy\n[noise] well um I had a rather nasty incident uh my daughter in law died this past Saturday oh my God yeah yeah and she passed away in her home she was a ... and I want to say really major massive kudos to fire and the sheriff's department\nOr they seem out of the handle every an extremely professionally\nOr they were very understanding they explain everything they had all the paperwork in order\nUh they get older they're tell us where to go what to do with the handle or they were uh\nI I just can't say enough about the deputy tenants who was really a great great guy with the food and sixteen and helping us through this particular quarter say and so you can say whatever you want to announce the sheriff's department of support we had a\nGiven the circumstances it very positive experience with them or they will train or a you have a handle things ah they were just really really great in dealing with people\nKarl on behalf of ... and I and the whole wake up family were totally sorry for your loss and this might have been a tough call for you to do so we totally appreciate what you're doing this or\nThat yeah I just wanted to pass on your all sorts of bad things but these guys get the best in really really crying difficult circumstances\nAlright girls going to keep the family in our prayers man to take care sir thank you for like seven nine zero twenty forty and phone number let's go to Kurt on line three current good morning sir\nMaureen Chris how are you very well are you a good hard to follow up Karl on that but I Do something\nHe would have to say a share ... ears deputies helped us out with a\nWith a challenge not too long ago and I appreciate that from him and his crew very much but I just wanted to say something to you I'm usually pretty easygoing guy\nBut this sort of thing ah regarding um attacks against sheriff Napier really works me up and the where it comes from is what really bothers me and\nI'm sure you know which Republicans um that are eating our own at this point but ultimately it it it's coming from the machine and [noise] um last time I was on the radio with you it was in the aftermath of sharing Bronson voting against ah the\nUm the funding for stone threat and so I did a little bit of research afterwards and I'm just so everyone knows here\nShe's got an agenda I Believe again sheriff Napier and one\nWay that I Believe I can say that with some certitude is by looking back at her campaign\nI'm a donations that she received during our twenty sixteen campaign lo and behold there someone with a last name now knows that lives where our former sheriff live that donated money\nThere's another person within last name of ...\nThat that lives where our ... county administrator lives and don't tell me that there aren't\nPeople that want to see sheriff Napier ousted and have the same crew that we had last time that we're known for their abuse of power\nAnd political agendas and so please please let's support sheriff Napier and what he's doing he is the best\nCurrent thanks for the good call man while they're in trouble so he had a boy for me we'll do alright and Alexander\n... let me give you a little bit of a things current uh a little bit of history here when I got here in the sixties\nThat's correct a
