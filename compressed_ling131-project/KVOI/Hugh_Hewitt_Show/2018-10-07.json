writer for wide open spaces and he has just\nWritten a new book it's a collection of essays I think you're really going to enjoy it the title of the book is called the hunters way a guide to the heart and soul of hunting Craig welcome to the show\nHey thanks jak thanks for having me great to be here\nSo why don't you tell the listeners a little bit about your book and some of the essays are going to find within it\nYeah it's been kind of a lifetime inside of me coming out and thanks to of course Harper Collins and day street books and we've been able to put this in writing it was about a year in the process and what they're going to find in the book is the stuff that I think the average\nGuy and Gail out there hunter will enjoy you know we have a chapters and the methodology of the hunter ego and outdoor appreciation or the heart and soul of reflection the hunters luck of course that's a big part you know there's a chapter about the most difficult game which I speak to a trophy hunting\nAnd that kind of thing it's it's it's really meant to be inclusive as it can be because the average hunter out there and that's what I'm shooting for\nYou know I'm just getting into this book just read the first is said the mythology of the hundreds ego really enjoyed it I mean when you started out you think it's a story about going on a deer drive\nUp but you kind of go along some pass some trails and through some rabbit holes and you cover a lot more than that you cover all sorts of different tactics that people used to get here or in some cases not ever get a deer\nAnd you tell you at all in together with the importance of the hunters ego itself\nIn in how that ties in with their own self worth it was really insightful\nWell thank you I appreciate that and ah you know compared to most\nOut there especially the elite hunters and the men and women who that we need so much in our hunting community and the hunting industry that you know get the word out there and they have the shows and the radio ... this is my take on getting out there\nAnd what works what doesn't work and why\nAnd ah you know what what really happens afterwards too you know it can be comical and we can rip each other and ah you know can you take the grief or ... or not and can you uh really find that inside yourself to uh use your own ego against yourself if that makes it\nIt does it does ... it let's talk a little bit about you I mean you never supposed to ask this question but I'm going to ask anyway how old are you in where have you done your hunting\nI'm ah fifty six years old\nAnd I've been a deer hunting and most of my life\nAnd the western part of New York state in fact uh this time of them are living with a family member on sixty acres of a beautiful deer woods and ah I mean just to get out there I mean you know it's not the open season for firearms yet I Know bow just open\nAnd just walking around in the woods and the leaves are just starting to fall over these Crispin a little wet\nThat is where it's at for any after you really gotta enjoy just being out there\nI agree completely folks you listen to America outdoors radio we're talking to ... he is the author of the hunters way a brand new collection of essays about the heart and soul hunting it's available on Amazon dot com and brick and mortar stores like Barnes and noble let's get back to hunting do Craig\nIn and they want to talk about something else here when it comes to the hunter versus the wildlife watcher you and I know that hundred numbers across the U.S are declining however people who get out there and enjoy watching wildlife their numbers are increasing but I personally believe that a hunter\nHas a stronger tie\nTo nature and the wildlife and the Flora and fauna that we see that maybe the casual bird watcher of wildlife watcher does\nYes I agree jazz and you know we as the hunters are men and women and hunting community we we see things from the inside out that are as usual to the casual observer and I guess what I mean by that is we walk off the path\nWe want to get into the sickest cover and go through a we get our face scratch that are armed dog we actually are looking at wildlife that's not there\nWhere ... in other words the folks out there to observe wildlife yeah they may be at the park or at the wildlife refuge and there's a good show and we love that too is hunters and fishermen of course but what we're looking for is tracks\nFeathers a things on the ground that maybe the most ... don't see and I don't mean to talk down to people like you know bird watchers an animal after that they don't notice these things but for hunters it means more\nIt shows us what's not there it shows us what can be there and ... will be there and we hope when the hunters are\nSo Craig we've got a collection of essays here and I know that they're like your children you love them all but for different reasons are there a couple that maybe stand out the ear especially proud of that you are looking forward to sharing with a wider audience\nYeah you know of course John thank you for that question the the ... the ... the great way to start the book you know we really thought that was the perfect beginning and of course there's a the hunters lock was a lot of fun to research and look into\nAnd find a way to a dead end to that I'm very proud of the most difficult game which speaks to trophy hunting and the arrogance of the culture\nWhich of course has a big place in the hearts and minds of all hunters men and women\nYou know uh we we all know somebody that has probably done that or maybe they've gone astray maybe they just uh you know as I said in the book you know there was a they have they found a spot\nAnd it was great and instead of taking their five ducks they took six or maybe they got a buck but a bigger one came the next day this is what I told my son since he was a little boy we all have to self regulate ourselves\nThere's

increase your love for him well in this\nSession I Want to talk to you about portraits of Christ not to be you can go with me to John chapter twelve beginning about verse twenty\nNow there were some Greeks are among those who went up to worship at the fees they came to fill up who was from ... in ... with a request sir they said\nWe would like to see Jesus\nWell fill up went to tell Andrew Andrew in Phillip intern told Jesus Jesus replied\nThe hour has come for the son of man to be glorified\nI tell you the truth\nUnless a kernel of great falls to the ground and dies it remains only a single seed but if it dies\nIt produces many seats\nThe man who loves his life will lose it while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life whoever serves me must follow me and where I Am my serving also will be my father will honor the one who serves me\nNow these Greeks had an interesting question a very good question we would like to see Jesus now I've discovered that\nA lot of people see him in a lot of different ways frankly not all of them are very accurate if you really want to see someone accurately you have to get a fairly broad\nPicture let me give you an example\nImagine with me for a moment that you're a person who lives in a village where Jesus is about to visit you heard about him and you're excited about his comment and so you're watching closely and when he arrives you watch and blind man comes up to him and says\nJesus I Would like to be able to see\nAnd so Jesus Says okay see ... his eyes come up\nAnd you say not bad not bad\nSo you start a Jesus church in your village and you call it the speak and be healed church and it grows and it prospers now you're another person in an entirely different village\nAnd Jesus is coming to your village are excited about this you want to see if he is who they say he is you're watching and the blind man comes up to him it seems that every village had one and says Jesus I Would like to be able to see\nSo Jesus reaches over in ... when they come up\nYou say not bad not bad\nSo you started Jesus church in your village and you call it the touch and be healed church and it grows and it prospers but now imagine that you're another person in another village and [noise]\nAnd so everything had gone wrong until Jesus enters the picture\nI Love it now he was a little resistance because he says it wasn't really is time\nOkay I'll do it for you\nAnd you know what she says and I love this when you if you want to know what Mary's messages to the world today is what she said right then whatever Jesus tells you to do\nThat was her last great message folks\nAnd if she's saying anything that's what she said whatever Jesus tells you to do\nAnd so Jesus said hey fill some water pots and bring them here\nAnd I did\nGo deliver him ... and as they pointed out\nAnd Ohio's dismiss it was obvious that this was incredible what this is better [laughter] every wonder why they why\nDid you put the best one out last usually it's a wine glass\nAnd you know what Jesus\nFor his first miracle\nSaved a party in that dream\nHe was so interested in these people just have a good time and the host and the marriage going off right now is not being embarrassed\nAnd so Jesus sort of introduces himself to the scene\nBy saying I Want you to have a good time\nAnd a lot of people you know think that God's the great party pooper\nOf life here you are moving\nAlong a lot of just having a full time and then John John's\nOn the scene when the fact is when Jesus came on the scene he saved a party\n[noise]\nI have to confess to you than I Am a terribly self centered man I think about myself\nAnd it's a miserable state [laughter]\n'cause I've discovered that the more I think about myself the more miserable I become\nAnd Jesus knew that you know he created us not for self centered and that's not even for self consciousness meant for others centered and that's because he says that's where the joy is does have you really want to find your life you have to give it away\nNow imagine yourself with Jesus you've you've been with this crowd of people for a couple of days and by now of course they're hungry they've been listening to him teaching and they're hungry the apostles we're a little slow in figuring this out after a couple of days now they say\nHey there people are hungry wouldn't take me that long to figure that out\nAnd then Jesus Says one of the funniest things in the world\nYou said that [laughter] I Love that I can hear the apostles saying I didn't hear that he didn't say\nWhat are we going to feed him with\nNine months salary wouldn't feed these people I think that might have been a hand a Jesus can we talk to you about apple is folic salaries while we're editor\nAnd then in the Bible tells us that Jesus was moved\nWith compassion towards these people\nHe saw them as she not having a shepherd he saw them in their hunger\nNever dawned on you that Jesus was hungry to I mean he was the one who had been doing work he's all\nBut you see\nJesus was the one truly others centered\nHe was the one who was truly interested\nAnd everybody else out there\nAbsolutely amazing\nWell he says do you have anything\nWell we have a little boy over here has got to launch that's all five loaves into fish is\nThat's enough [laughter]\nHave you have you ever found yourself really needing\nSomething from God really needing help really needing\nA touch as we will sometimes say from God some kind of direction and Jesus Says well\nI moved toward you\nOh man I only\nGot about thirty cents [laughter]\n[noise] and I can hear Jesus saying\nWell work with that [laughter] he did not say and I I liked it he did not say do these disciples\nJust five loaves into fishes will I I'm not sure I Need six lows to do this trick that's not going to be in a closed\nBut you see what I've discovered is whatever it is we have in the hands of Jesus\nAnd so he blesses takes it any less is it not\nAll of us want to be blast it's it's a common word we use it all the time will either say bless you are all I Wish they would buy snakes I Wish the lord bless me we can't even define the word without using the word but we just know that\nWe want a blessing and\nSometimes we go to church not you guys I'm not talking about you guys you I'm Talking about others\nSometimes where you go to church and we find ourselves a good safe seats somewhere where nobody can really see us or what have you done we sit there and my\nSalary I spent a tough week Satan spam and I made a blessing I Hope you're blacksmith today\nThey've got thirty minutes to blast by\nNow when we come in that kind of state it's miserable you know that you know that but what would have happened what would happen if instead we came with this kind of thought\nOh man\nI Wonder if I can be a blessing today I Want to bless somebody\nI Wonder whether it be you\nAnd when we gather together we just sort of have this little sneaky look wondering do I get to bless you are you the one are you the one\nAnd that fits in with the very nature of Jesus here Jesus takes these bonds with Columbine\nAny blesses them\nWell folks ah that's not what I had in mind when I got blessed I didn't want to get\nBroken\nBut that's what's next [laughter] the bloods as you\nI Want that I'd rather say ladies and gentlemen are now looking at a blessed barn and I'd be on every TV showing you know you're looking at ... [noise]\nWell I'll just sit here and low for a while\nNow\nHe blesses and he breaks but I Want you to notice why he doesn't break just so he can say boy did I break him\nNo he breaks so he can give away and give away\nI ...\nI told your\nJesus was the one truly others shattered\nPerson and even proves it at this moment because now I Want you to see something that hit me and I thought yes Jesus dishes you\nDating five thousand people is a pretty hefty task I don't know if any of you have ever done that or not if you ever had a gathering at your house and it turned out to be five [laughter] it it is a logistical problem\nAnd somebody has got to be pretty busy providing bread such as who is probably the hungry as person and the price\nEnds up being\nBecause he was moved with compassion say he cared about these people\nAnd he was doing his best to see\nThat there needs were taken care of\nSome amazed at this man\nThanks for spending this time with us if you enjoy this portion of

time again I'm going to lose my lunch\nIs in every movie it's in every talk show it's in every book it is the standard new age answer your problems\nIt started in a movie Star Wars\nOr that great theologians Obi Wan ...\nSays the young Luke Skywalker when he is going through his crisis he says he answers are within new look inside yourself there's nothing new about the new age all the new age is re packaging of all lies\nAll put together they didn't work a thousand years ago they don't work today\nAnd this one here is just look within yourself when you're in trouble\nCome on that's the problem\nI looked at it in my cellphone anyway yeah\nI didn't like what I saw I got the press one I looked within myself I don't need to look within myself the answers let's I don't care how many people tell you that the answer is not look within yourself because if it was you'd already be changed it doesn't work\nYou need to look to God\nHe's the only one who can change you is the only one who can help you he's the only one was sustaining strength\nAnd you need to look not with in you you need to look outside of yourself to the creator who made you because the answers are not in you the answers are in God\nIt doesn't work the other way\nCall out for God's help\nFill your mind with God's word the number three in those an fixable situations of why\nExcept support from God's people\nThe Bible says by helping each other with your troubles you truly obey the law Christ what is that law\nLove your neighbor as yourself\nThe great commandment\nAnd if you don't have some strong Christian friends mature believers and you're not in a small group where you can have some feedback and some support when the crisis is on I feel pity for you I really do\nWe don't continue to harp on this issue week after week after week get in a small group getting a small group getting a small groups just because it's an idea\nIt is essential for your physical spiritual and mental health you need a support group got never meant for you to go through life alone on your own\nYou're not a Lone Ranger in fact got intentionally in the Bible says puts weaknesses in our lives so we realize how much we\nNeed each other\nWe needed and you're not going to make it on your own you need to accept support from God's people and then number for\nWhen you're facing the un fixable problems of life you need to hold on\nTo God's promises hold\nOn to ... promises they're over seven thousand of them in the Bible waiting to be claimed waiting for you to just grab on to like blank checks\nHere's one of them\nI say forty he gives strength\nTo the weary and increases the power of the week even use go tired\nBut those who hope in the lord circle that hoping the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wins like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not faint\nKeep your whole in the lord and even more than that keep your eyes focused on the hope of heaven not just on the here and now focus on the hope is having looked at the next verse so we don't look\nAt the troubles we can see right now\nRather we look forward to what we have not yet seen for the troubles we see will soon be over but the joystick calm\nWill last forever\nIn heaven\nThere's going to be no problem in heaven\nThere's going to be no sorrow\nHeaven there's going to be no sadness\nAnd have it it's going to be no sadness no grief no messed up live\nWhere do you need God's standing grace the day\nWhere ... where are you discourage\nYou feel like you have you been tempted needle man I just I'm being pounded with this and I can't get rid of this temptation\nAre you tired I just I don't think I can put another foot in front of each other or are you under tension are you in trials in trouble that you can't fix\n\nNo matter what you're going through\nGod's Grace will sustain you if you will let it look at this last verse Paul said I beg the lord three times that take this problem away from me but he said to me my grace is enough\nFor you when you're awake than my power is made perfect than you when you're going through a problem you can't fix don't give up\nLook look that's power\n\nI'd like to close the special prayer for those have you ever discourage this morning\nYou may be struggling with worry well he can fix that\nYou may be struggling with guilt and shame he can handle that\nYou may be dealing with depression or financial conflict\nOr conflict in your home\nOr you may be dealing with unemployment\nOr infertility or something you cannot control\nIt can handle it\nSo tell him right now what is discouraging you\nTell him passionately\nIt's okay to shed a tear Ellen passionately what is discouraging you\n\nJesus Christ you know every single need represented here today\nYou know what we need even before we ask\nYou know are hurt and you know our fears you know our struggles and you know our sense\nYou know our loneliness you know our grief\nFor those who are hurting here this morning they find relief for those who are discouraged\nMe they experience your sustaining grace\nMay they sense your arms of love wrapping around them today\nFor those who are carrying a heavy load may they understand your power in your piece as available", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "07"}
