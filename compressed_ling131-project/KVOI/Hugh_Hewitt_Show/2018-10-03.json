Newport Beach filling in Louisville Jenny in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and and in San Diego ten women nine out of ten supported what the president did last night ten outta ten one cabinet can for one out of ten said\nHe should have left the attack on the testimony to others what did you think\nI don't think the president needed to put on that show last night\nYou know I thought last friday\nI'm saying let's have an investigation for a week from one week was excellent she's in that third lane of let's just take a breath\nLet's have everyone listened to by the FBI I Wish it wasn't done in such a public fashion let's take a week to listen to this was extraordinary and I thought the way the president handled it on Monday in the south on saying you know stand this thing for the we expanded ...\nAsked Comey need to get asked because I Do worry about all of the people all of the families involved here why the president\nWent out swinging last night stopped talking and the president wanted to go out swinging last night swim about NAFTA on Monday he delivered for all Republican he delivered his protectionist base by tearing up NAFTA in name and things are going to get something new and then he delivered a moderate\nBy saying let's create a slightly new and improved NAFTA and actually\nGo after things like intellectual property and do it with Canada and Mexico Mexico and Canada\nThe short end of the sticking a straight line Justin Trudeau will get over it that's what Trump\nCould have one on last night that serves all Republican instead what he did\nWas go to his lowest base

about not being aware of the committee would come to her ex boyfriends letter about\nA polygraph the second door investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report I think there have been a lot of questions that have arisen since the president's first statement about her testimony that he felt he had to focus on any did it his classic hammer and sores hammer way\nOf saying let's let's go ahead and clear there's nothing classic about the way he behaved all the points you make let them be valid points to the FBI and let them do their job\nI Can't say that I had any idea what happened\nI'm Glad that

all of them all up all of them politically hit nothing anybody you know the only they are open seemingly ... even though they're tested then you know Senator Cornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree ah because I think in these red states that President Trump carried a I think uh I think the judicial I mean I'm sure on I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what Lindsey just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA we've talked Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as ... as\nBasically confirmed that you know I think some things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of the McCarthyism directed at\nBrett cabinet nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this this ridiculous allegation that judge will somehow be\nA partisan or a display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or sugar corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to uh take this the slander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position\nWho feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and um be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged in good faith because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kaplan I I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way in that the general sense in the ...\nWell I think you'll see overwhelming support in that caucus for uh for the judge there are some of our colleagues shoe for whom this FBI supplemental background investigation was requested they said it would be necessary\nBut I Believe that there is no cooperation which I Believe will be the case that uh that will eliminate the last obstacle to the judge getting confirmed\nAnd then completely off the topic will the u._s. and see a pass the necessary margin in I don't know if it's fast track majority of its treaty two thirds but the new NAFTA will pass the Senate\nI think it's going to be an uphill fight because when we pass trade promotion authority there were Thirteen Democrats forty seven Republicans to pass that\nAnd of course we've seen just visceral of opposition to everything that the president proposes and so it's going to be a tough sell but I certainly hope we uh we can do it and it'll require fifty one votes as you know\nI didn't know that so it's only a fifty one vote number\nThat's correct we probably not going to get to it I wouldn't think you until after the first to the year given the timing of of this so uh but it's something worth doing and I think we need to do it\nSenator John Cornyn always a pleasure thank you for joining me senator I appreciate it thanks you now I Want to tell you about alliance defending freedom John Cornyn is a great

on stage when you're batting fifty fifty that correct my twist in his chair a little bit but that's OK I'm real quick access ah let's talk about the\nTax reform to point out where where where where are you where you are kind of tracking this thing where the\nYeah the Trump to point out the list of tax cuts that they were talking about doing is fine it's a great collection it is expanding\nA tax free savings that makes it easier to say for the future it makes it easier to take money that you're saving 'em and and Spanish merging sees without being penalize it's it's great I get it also helps a smaller businesses start up and people can expense\nThe first twenty thousand of if they invest in their own company getting going to start your small business that's got that it takes all the existing tax cuts that phase out at some point makes the permanent which is always the goal\nUm and that's fine but the most important thing about tax reform to point out is that the Republican House the Republican Senate and President Trump all his said we're going to have more tax reform\nAnd more tax reduction every single year that there's a Republican House Senate ...\nSo what they're telling the American people as we elect a Republican House re elect Republican Senate and you will have\nMore tax reduction if you like the Democrats that want to raise taxes but the Republican position is not oh every Thirty years we'll check in and do something big right Nineteen eighty six that and that that twenty ... twenty thousand Seventeen\nWe're going to do this every year always in the same direction simpler lower more transparent easier to understand what progress up\nThe um we keep talking about I asked you to the last time where do we think the Republican Party is at selling to the American public that all of this economic prosperity low unemployment all these good things we're talking about are actually getting sold in these key race areas\nTo make a difference do we think the Republican Party is doing it\nWell the candidates or do I get a Republican Party certainly making the case the president when he goes out speaks people do understand you look at the polling people like the Republican economic policy\nThey they recognize that there's less regulation garish lower taxes they're serious if they ... the government's not doing a bunch of dumb things it's not just what we're doing is also all the things that Hillary was going to do that we aren't doing a there's been very helpful to the stock market\nThe stock market going up as everybody with money betting is this going to get bigger and better and and the smart people with ... and I say this is getting bigger this is getting better and we've got the new reports and it's got to be four percent plus and the third quarter of this year\nI'm so we'll have to last six months growing at four percent a year when the Obama people said his left you know nobody can ever do as much as two anymore you know just to last a Jew is the new normal because it is a new normalcy regulate too much taxed too much and how the government you know treat working people as an enemy\nI think ... Thomas Friedman said getting or anything on the fourth because well I'm I'm a Trump was saying it on the campaign trail was an elephant flying are pigs flying I forgot what he said but\nPain trail was an elephant flying are pigs flying for what he said but the kind of happened\nAnd it just shows how unserious some of these public intellectuals are Thomas Friedman is not an economist thinker he's a democratic hack\nWho writes well and here's the answers are always within the concept of the Democratic narrative is not possible to get four percent growth yes you do all the dumb things you want to do that is true that is true if you don't think the Democrats won you cannot get four percent off but we don't want to do all the dumb things to Democrats\nTherefore we can't get to ... percent growth and get more people jobs and get wages up um\nAnd make the United states more competitive and the world today\nSo what I've noticed on a real quick before I let you go the ah the the redo of NAFTA okay which a lot of American presidents that they were going to do and never did okay we got it done and now here we are we're a border we're I mean we're forty seven minutes from the border\nMexico is a huge partner to Arizona trade was okay and what I'm noticing is because Democrats who hate Trump don't want to give them any sort of\nOf ah credit for his administration getting this done I even the local economic groups who won't even mention it because it came out of his administration so tell me is is it as good as he says what what what what what what what's your take on it\nThere's some progress there in getting property rights intellectual property rights are recognized this is part\nWe should wait the president shook things up with Europe that look scary because a trade war would that would be expensive a nasty and he forced to negotiations zero zero zero ... our goal is to get to zero tariffs Geron non tariff barriers zero substance huge went to the United states just moving in that direction and he really get to ...\nI don't know I may take a while but you can't go wrong moving in that direction that subtle problem\nThan Canada and Mexico we made some changes we got things now that people said you know the the ... that the Mexico that new government so hostile a lot happened ... well that should do which is so hostile that he doesn't want to do what he did um now he in the world face\nChina which is the large bad actor on stealing people's actual actual property [noise]\nUm and and really robbing our high tech companies that deal with them and and stealing stuff [noise] um this is a huge step in the right direction we're not going to have a series of trade wars we had an argument with tariffs as the weapon which is always dangerous it could it bounced into a trade war that there was a certain danger there okay it took a lot of skill\nTo make that not happen and whatever the president did he did it right\nUm so now we've got to China and my guess is that we'll get an improved deal with China because they just saw him\nGas prices generally are far less in Tucson then or many parts of actually the nation definitely\nFor the states over the past month or so I've been getting a lot of these\nLetters to the editor and phone calls saying you know there's gotta be something going on because our prices are twenty five to forty cents a higher than Tucson and you know you look around and actually there's a gas station and ... that's probably twenty five cents less than everybody else in Syria in green valley and\nSo we as we do generally have done in the past week called the attorney general's office and they remind us that gas prices in Arizona are not regulated they can pretty much do whatever they want\nAs long as they're not gouging people and gouging generally only comes during a crisis so they can do what they want they can certainly look at collusion whatever but as they told us you know we haven't had any complaints out of there and we need complaints before we can look into this so the last time they really looked into it\nAh technically was around two thousand seven and they found that uh there was no illegal conduct by those in the market and pretty much what we're just seeing is kind of a free market economy it's a you know what a\nWhat the market will bear and so uh and we also by the way have one of the few in fact I haven't seen one\nOutside of Arizona and a long time a [noise] a a full service bay at one of our gas stations you just pull up and they they do everything for you I Know some states I think Oregon requires that\nYou not to pump your own gas but here they'll they'll do it for you and it costs a little bit more so you know um it is high and if you're if you're shop around you can you can get a good deal and in a an area where a lot of people still are on fixed incomes this type of stuff matters\nWe uh I kind of feel like the um one of the newly say when you talk to these gas ... you know the oil companies and the gas company right we only make a few like a couple of cents a gallon right\nYeah yeah like grocery stores are always say that the the profit margins very thin and you know if you drop of a you know a jar of jelly an aisle seven to send them over the edge you know but that I and I don't I don't believe it ... uh but uh I Do know that it's a it's a tough\nBusiness and you know it is cost a little bit more to haul gas to certain areas and then\nUh you know I think really what the issue with green valley is is that the people don't drive very far and so a gas tank can laugh them all summer\nAnd so you got to kinda get them when you can get 'em and so they're not buying gas every week like I Am there are there so there's just not much of a market for it and so that has to be considered also\nLet's get to your um I called the you're blazing Ramona ... has tore on the Sunday paper about operations ... you were a times I thought you were very balanced with the same time you did you did take them to pass a little bit\nWell he has just been a real disappointment in what I Hope that the people in somebody to do is start paying attention to the board of supervisors it's her second layer of government so it doesn't get that much attention and people are more focused on what's happening at a town hall\nSo Ramon um [noise] represents part of ... we have three of the five supervisors who have pieces of this area down here which also doesn't help\nAnd uh he but he represents the bulk of it and he had voted against the stone garden money and then for it and then against it on September fourth which was the the the last vote but the one chance yesterday\nTo come back and get on board with a resolution by supervisors Steve Christie that would have said going forward if it's a public safety issue the sheriff can go ahead and accept grants without the approval of the board\nWe knew this was going to go down in flames unless valid as had an epiphany which he didn't\nUh and the one burning question for me is why now why after accepting dozens of stone garden grants and things like it are you\nNow deciding that it's a bad thing so this is the twelve year that we have accepted this grant and it's the first year\nWe've turned it down and the difference is\nThat Donald Trump is in office and mark Napier is an office they're both Republicans and this Democrat dominated board want us to stick to them and they did\nBut really what they did is they stuck it to us because this is a political decision that ultimately hurts Pima County\n... those yeah so this is ... this this is really depressing to be outside the because this is politics I mean if you remember back in February when this all came out valid us came out and said well there's five conditions that we want to or\nDo we want met mark Napier came back I think you're just a few weeks later and said okay those conditions have been met you may not like what we're doing with the money you may not like how we're accounting for it but we have met your conditions and then there was a delay all summer and then they finally voted and\nFor for Ramon valid as really what it amounts to is I think he was fearful of splitting\nWith the other or with the other two Democrats and that means that he has no spine and uh he is cannot cannot make his own decisions\nSo I Hope after the next um I Hope that next election he goes away because we need someone who actually is going to stick up for what he believes in because I think in his heart he knows that it was right to accept this money he just didn't do it\nNo one uses the word brave Ramon ... sort of\nYou know don't don't draw me into that fund law\nHere here's a sense I Would use brave and ruin roaming Ramon volunteer has won two in Atlanta Braves baseball game\nAnd that's not a [laughter]\n... and ... and isn't it pitiful but uh I guess it's also pitiful that the voters in ... to probably don't know who their supervisor is and and part part of that because they've carved up the town pretty good uh but they also don't know the importance of it but I'll tell you that this has uh it says a lot of interest\nOr and I I don't think you know I Believe voters have very short memories unfortunately and I don't know that he'll pay at the ballot box for it but ah this did resonate down here I could say that and that's\nBut this did resonate down here I can say that and that's that's always a good thing to get people thinking\nAnd people are ... may be saying well damn ... how can there be three different supervisors for one town right and so I read that right and the reason of course is is when you do the re goes redistricting plan right and you got to carve out other parts of the districts to protect things\nWhat happens is the leftovers get cut up and thrown in the three to\nAbsolutely and so this is a this is what what when they're carving up those new districts I think it's called what areas of common interests meaning and so I Would say that the town of ... is an area of common interests and we all should be at one supervisor\nOf district and and we're not so I don't I don't know if there's any hope for that and twenty Twenty one they're redrawn but we certainly are going to be pushing for it\nWhat are you know so we had the uh the green valley council that gets Seventy pow from the county to do whatever they're doing a big code came out for the bond right for sixty three right now is interesting I had a quick question for me 'cause I Know Chuck spoke\nI ... I Know he was there I Know Steve's Christie was I don't know if you smoke or not\nBut was there any one from the no side at that meeting I was going to ask you\nWell they didn't really pitch it as a as a pep rally for the bonds\nWhat it was wasn't explainer and you know how that works if I Do so they they just came out and they said okay here's here's what it's gonna be the answer to a lot of questions they're all good questions\nAnd they said you know here's what happens and then um they definitely green valley council said we believe this is our our last opportunity that's what Steve Christie believes also is that this is\nA they've tried other things Steve has has presented a plan other tip put forward ideas and they feel like this\nPretty much is it so uh and and Huckleberry has flat out said I don't know what we're going to do it just doesn't get through so uh that's really what what the message was so uh but they did come down to just answer questions so we'll see\nWe'll see how the voters or what they think that um I Am hearing just even over the last couple of weeks more people just questioning\nWhether this really is the route um that they want to go and maybe we'll wait and try to\nDo it a different way maybe getting a sales tax or cutting some stuff from the county budget which I think I don't know that you can cut your way out of this massive problem because of course yeah it's well it's been building for Twenty years it's it is\nWhat is the idea that well let's do you hold it hold on for one more second player ever got dance your green valley news will talk about this and a couple of other things before it's all over\nPeruvian food for a Wednesday food friday Adriana it's going to come in she got she videotaped the lady ripping down signs\nOn the side and then I don't know like somehow this woman tried to run her off the road once you I mean it's yeah it's a real hootenanny here we go into politics that's going on after a Peruvian food and then a Bob ... lovely wife Peggy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "03"}
