why we're putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect you can hear the European governments talk about staying in the deal\nEuropean

pursue programs of weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and a dangerous state worldwide\nAny doubt in your mind that the response of this president into any Iranian backed ... on the United states territory or against American ships are flash it\nNow I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five seed an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened while our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and

they'd never seen an American president this tough before a I think their behavior or needs to be adjusted in the trade area and the international military and political areas and a whole range of areas\nPerhaps we'll see at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month\n... willing to come to talk turkey on some of these issues are but the president feels very strongly that China's taking advantage of the international order for far too long not enough Americans have stood up to it now's the time to do and\nTry to ... to ... an eyes the export of commercial technology in recent reports with Bloomberg and elsewhere was there an arms race of which we were completely unaware of not participating\nWe were being taken to the cleaners for decades ever since China came into the world Trade Organization\nOr they have pursued American to list the economic policy and what should be a free trade environment a and they'd gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocate in the ... to the WTO that if they came in international pressure\nWould make China conform to these\nRules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse\nThey steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investment that's required and research and development they forced technology transfer is from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies are and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating or the international norms we expected them to comply with\nThey've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they've built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background or among other things he's challenging him on the economic grounds and if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology\nOr their military capabilities would be substantially reduced at a lot of the tensions we see caused by

Dr are and I want to go back to the Brett Kavanaugh proceedings ready for a moment um\nAfter the testimony a doctor for\nUm some time passed and Brett Kavanaugh appeared and he was angry and as a result of that anger many people questioned his judicial temperament and I thought to myself if you had not been angry then I Would have a question judicial temperament because you've been accused of cereal gang rape\nOr greater slander possible actually a term that but what was that what what is what is wrong with our commentary at in this regard\nYeah well we're supposed to bow you know to these things and or you're not supposed to supposed to what you know\nI I don't I I think it was a very good judgment not to attack professor Ford uh I think she didn't seek all of this I thought Susan Collins stateless eloquent about all of that I thought it was dignified as that\nShe had to find them there and and the point is this woman had you know she wrote a letter and she's troubled and she thinks she live or something and she can't remember the tail\nAnd she didn't she didn't try to trust this thing for other people got hold of it and they and I think the blame of all because as I say about that how you gonna are you gonna run the country\nIf somebody a stage allegations and you know I said there's no proof available well it's a little worse than that right because if you read that thing by the by the council for this to me that interview her the details of her story are inconsistent\nAnd you know there are some things that are verifiable\nThey're not as she said and she said more than one thing about things that are actually losing\nWell don't blame her for that these are old memories about something painful and that but but the truth is to make that cause to disrupt this thing is failure of the rule of law\nNow in terms of the presumption of innocence and due process\nWhat a most astonished me about this is that so many people through and so quickly\nWith the idea that an accusation without contemporaneous corroborating evidence can be vetted in public without damage not just to the accused but to the process\nI mean it is it is nowhere in our tradition in the common law or to allow someone to convict the accusation that mean that goes back before the country was founded\nIf and see adjust contest a little bit right this is not a trial he thought nobody has brought charges against him this is a political event\nAnd it's certainly true that is right it's fine to raise charges against him and it's even trying to raise wild ones\nBut ... hopes that won't be affected but look what happened here he goes through a a a set of exhausted hearing is investigated interviews pride with every senator who was willing to talk to him and then the other thing is he has a long career\nThis guy has a paper trail and he's not so old guy just out of the blocks right he's he's been so there's a huge amount of material and it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him and then this stuff is brought up\nAnd that is not the air or a good political maneuver and if she transferred to add to what it would take to convict the guy of something which is rightly a different standard than just making an argument about politics and this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd everywhere we come back we're going to play for your um you the

company is looking for an entry level candidate pretty serious to me isn't quite what we're used to but you've got a fantastic work ethic\nWe have we have a disagreement about the history but I'm very aware immigration are\nNow Larry aren't here is the history in Nineteen sixty eight when Abe Fortas was nominated in an election year\nHe was filibustered by the Republicans and Democrats because of ethics issues but there were sixty four Democrats in the Senate in Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd the Republicans were not cooperating they were seeing that unless they were to stop him the or the impeachment process it was going to go for it could have sixty four and a thirty six\nIn Nineteen fifty six William Brennan was recess appointed because it it had not move forward under a Democratic Senate so Mitch McConnell\nActually was right and my friend John Dickerson was not but there is a broad and the land a great ignorance about the basic fact the Senate is a majority ... institution that agrees\nTo operate by super majority during and rules in some instances\nRules which they can change is Harry Reid demonstrated on their wisdom and which Mitch McConnell changed after Harry Reid changed him with regard to the Supreme Court justices and the fact of the matter is I don't I think we will we will if\nA God Forbid adjusted drop dead three weeks before the election of a twenty twenty I think the Senate would come from a replacement [laughter]\n[laughter] I wouldn't be surprised at first of all remember what\nThe kind of did at the moment when he delayed Merrick Garland it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to win the election right and so he wasn't he was actually make the authority of the people more telling or stronger in the process\nThis is one of the things you get to choose when you vote for president\nSo the idea that he was trying to warn people he actually involved in more in the process\nAnd I'll say it's it's actually opposite because you know in the great ... and this earlier\nThe first time ... opposition hard throughout the governing party by a popular vote without violence was in a two hundred and America and the federalist party which had built the country for goodness sake got hammered\nBy Jefferson's party and Madison's party it also and so what they they have all these midnight appoint ask election ask do they know they've got hammered and they just got to go to a whole bunch of people in there\nAnd they don't get 'em all down and that's what gave rise to the great court case ... versus Madison\nBut they were you know that was in Lebanon our same against a popular vote this is the opposite of that\nAnd you mentioned but they were ... it was both are legitimate and and what I Want to point the rules are laid out this is not secret\nWe operate under a constitutional structure that was meant to be read by and was reading debated by farmers some of whom are not literate but who would listen closely and we over complicate this this is the Senate\nHas the right to not hold a hearing the Senate has a right to confirming one day the Senate whatever the majority of the Senate wants to do the Senate can do and sent mentioning\nThere's action suit right and so if they do anything that people don't like the people can punish them right yeah that's what keeps dishonest you're right about that right and and if you are if a\nWell look look what McConnell is done and he's proud of himself right because the election who would have predicted it All right this presidential election when they win and that Harry Reid changed that rule\nI wished by the way that they would restore the filibuster generally two is nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century movie\nAnd then they can pass a lot more laws and when the other guys get in a lot more laws and then the people get a chance to choose\nIt looks to me like Arnold maneuvering us toward a better position in regard to that\nHe's been doing he's an absolutely amazing leader and I know that some\nIn our number on the right to not like him for reasons I cannot figure out but he is a master of the Senate he has set up they confirmed Fifteen judges yesterday there are twenty nine appeals court judges I did the math last night Larry\nThat Seventy five thousand Trump judge authored opinions over the next twenty five to Thirty years out of each of those judges will author between one hundred and fifty opinions a year\nAnd each of them are going to serve between twenty and Thirty years at Seventy five thousand opinions at the appeals court level and also it's been partly here sixty to Seventy five of these things a year so that was mostly where the law in the United states has made this at that level and Mitch McConnell with Donald Trump and Don McGahn who is the unsung hero here has worked a revolution\nIs it well they were serious about it from the first minute and and remember this to a Donald Trump as a candidate announced a list of the hands of\nPeople he would have in other words he has submitted his direction just like I said my cold in a minute ago they have made it what they intend to do to a vote of the people under the

who's your advocate who do you advocate for its taxpayers and small business owners and between this place and what you're doing a with a pottery outlet down on old locales highway\nQuality pottery quality pottery die but in reality that's what I thought quality pottery you guys are living you are the small business owner Pima County while we try it's just a family business and you know we have a lot of struggles and\nUh but I wouldn't have it any other way he gives me a lot of flexibility and like in my own\nBoss so when you meet somebody at a party for the first time and you say hey I own pottery fiesta and they say what's that what do you tell them well uh\nI usually go well you have you heard a quality pottery because that that place has been in business a lot longer right and it's easier to go from there because a lot of people have just been twenty some years they're familiar with that by German I was way down there but uh you know I just don't like ... a big deal is hyper pottery and ... that's kind of our meat and potatoes and then\nWe have a lot of decorative stuff while wall art and stuff you can compliment all that stuff but I mean is the weather gets cooler now we're in beautiful weather time uh this is the time you're going to be spending the most for me I spend the most time\nOn my back yard starting about I'm about twenty days ago yeah it really is

off you got I got to the dear Chris letter\nSo we decided I Do a dramatic reading at the end of the show but we needed a best to break up songs to read it to pack and so literally we took a whole bunch of calls that day with all these great makeup breakup songs so on her YouTube page you can hear me a read my dear Chris letter from councilman 'cause object\nTo Paul Simon's fifty waves to leave your lover so yeah so at Alexander I think you're going to have to uh\nPlay that before it's all over so now a and I saw I assume you saw the news about the uh music modernization act that a Trump sign yesterday yeah so of course because Kanye was there there are more worried about Kanye\nRight I'm weird yeah major news thing so yeah\nSo we've been talking about this so let's go to the accomplishments this is off of um Vioxx here let's see so the bill accomplishes three main tasks it's streamlined process which music rights holders can be paid for their songs being played on streaming services that also includes the songs producers\nAre who we are not getting paid right ah in the payment for when the songs are played over satellite or online radio the first time producers have ever been mentioned in a bill of this sort ever\nAnd then it allows for a payment of royalties for songs written before Nineteen Seventy two to both songwriters and performers\nSo and actually got unanimous support from Republicans and Democrats in both the Senate and the house\nSo so what happens was all these years or you buy a song you play a song or the writer or ... to ... and composer would get paid a all these years\nThe artist never got anything okay that unless they had a a a contract of some kind of deal with the record company but ... that's why they all went on the road so they could\nSell tickets themselves are paraphernalia on the road because the artists who had the hits me this\nNever got any money Jessica writers\nOkay and the composer so now you add the art is and the producers well you know look at a label how many producers are on I think everybody gets a peace or something something\nAnd I don't know how you're going to keep track of all that but that somebody else's problem so what was the whole hub of why why it was Nineteen Seventy two the dividing line no one that was because what flowing Eddie or the turtles started this whole thing\nRight or they said hey you know we had all these hits in the sixties and we're not getting any money for them you know every time to get laid happy together and stuff like that\nWhen we get any money you know um and uh unless they wrote I don't think they wrote it um\nSo I don't know where the Seventy two Kenyan I that's all right\nI don't have the I just I was thinking about I read this and then as I was reading in the again this morning I'm like why is Seventy two the dividing line as\nWe say ... maybe when they started this whole thing it was so many of fifty years back or something like that and they came up to Seventy two and they just kept that number or something but I'm not quite sure on that one\nAnd then our boy and Lindsay Buckingham is officially suing Fleetwood Mac for not a ... a ... quote touring with out him yeah\nAnd he says none of his bandmates will will turn his calls to explain why so he was officially sealing Mick Fleetwood Stevie Nicks Christine ... claiming he should still be ... I paid a share of tour revenues 'cause he's still wants to be able to perform with the group\nThat they fired him I guess he's got a a interview and the Rolling Stone this uh this uh which I don't read anymore because it's so darn you're not missing much about it I Know it's ridiculous but it wasn't for rap\nArtist you wouldn't ... Rolling Stone magazine anymore\nBut I guess he he told them you know that they called in\nOn the phone and said you were fired he said what and he said you know he said well we were we were doing too good anyhow but would so um and yeah and don't and they'll call us ever again kind of thing so we are\nSo according to the complaining says there's never been a written band agreement and the group just agreed that each member had the right to veto any major decision\nAnd shared equally in the bans ownership right [noise] so he's but he was in the band from Seventy five to eighty seven rejoined in Ninety seven\nSo he's saying is that he's still been in this band since Nineteen Ninety seven or during the entire time he's been in Fleetwood Mac the ban has conducted itself with a partnership image of the members that having writing Vito ... rights over the ban decision making\nAnd an equal share soaked Lindsey wants is either you know get me on the tour with you or pay me my money mhm\nSo I think I think most of America is on Lindsay Buckingham\nSo I think so [laughter] you know uh who knows what happened to be but I mean they were banned and I don't know if you can be a ... you know if you if you fired you're fired I guess let's let's do you have a really\n... again if that will legally don't you think if there's no written agreement and the four of them want to go touring without him what does he have he does he really have a leg to stand on and I would say that a big fat now yeah I don't think so\nOkay ah ah you know those uh entertainment contracts are pretty sick so they didn't do that for a while to keep the lawyers going for a while the um\nLook what let's switch to politics real quick before we get some more fun stuff before it's all over so we'll see what happens with this video that has surfaced of ms cinema\nWith her crazy\nA line about Republicans in Arizona\nThis is from an Arizona a republic ... von ... get Sanchez or we call her why W s and in the business yeah uh let's see we got here and she was then a state center in two thousand eleven oh this is your October surprise right [noise]\nUh she said that Republicans in Arizona are crazy and she could not distinguished from Tea Party activists to influence and others deemed harmful to Arizona the video of course has leaked out on social media and was re circulated of course by allies of her\nOpponent Martha McSally\nA cinema has fashioned herself as an independent Mike a Democrat who's interested in working across the aisle\nIn or two thousand eleven comments she repeatedly slam Arizona Republicans often generating laughs from the audience using variations of the term crazy actually I watched it this morning there's one guy close to the phone that took this video the guy who's laughing\nI just it's not that funny I I couldn't believe he was laughing that hard um coat over the past several years people have watched what's happening in Arizona and then like damn those people are crazy send them a Cessna video\nQuote is it something in the water no the ...\nWatch what's happening in Arizona and been like damn those people are crazy cinema says in a video\nQuote is it something in the water no the water's fine we stole it from Colorado she says the Laffer laughter\nQuote there's nothing wrong with the water there's something wrong with the people in public office in Arizona people say oh Tea Party the Tea Party please those people have been in charge like Twenty years they're just called Republicans\nAs a child growing up cinema said she remembered learning a song about the famous five seeds of Arizona I Would add to fix the she said it's called crazy because that's what's happening in my state it's pure craziness pure craziness\nSo again we'll see Martha's got enough money to uh and they and they got to hold on to the Senate seat here after flake so I assume they're going to pound your TV and radio commercials are Martha's ... campaign please call it a drawn if you want to advertise on the show\nBut they need to they need to pound is just like Lee and needs the pound the or the end for Patrick do yeah this this debate I think two two ladies out there and that's just putting it nicely with the words were but that's all I can say on the radio thank you very much at Alexander\nLet's do this let's spin a weight or great sponsors when we come back I Want to talk about the uh the the um the Leah decision not to listen to an R.

Tom Carlson from them around the school district so hope to see out here at pottery fiesta\nTwenty percent off the entire store and then when you get that total they knock off an extra wake up to San ten percent so please join us it's a beautiful morning up in the Catalina\nMountains of Lee say wake up to sonic let me explain this to the other side or the wrong day tomorrow is Paul Simon and a bunch of other great people's birthdays but and and so actually dwell is doesn't have that many grape or they will find some stuff for you but one of them tomorrow which is already queued up [noise]\nNo one who is interested in promoting Democrats in the in the journalism field want to say what everyone saw which is an anchor Patrick choked it she was an incur here and\nThis can populated mess at that debate and lead that a good job\nI think through different question saying that she's the hometown girl she's already working with the people in southern Arizona and and really is truly the carpetbagger not a good\nThing and that story when asked about her carpet bag goodness because and said she was here because her daughter was having a I don't know she had some health issue whatever she came down here will now her daughter doesn't even live here in her son's working here and then when and was on with me in\nAugust she actually admitted on the air that she's sharing an apartment with her son\nSo and is absolutely a bona fide carpetbagger that's I I don't think these are but I'm just telling you this is the most misreported debate of what went on that I've that I've seen in the last so many years in Tucson\nVery ... because if you watched the debate you know exactly what happened and then you see how it's been reported in you're going to see the same thing\nSo when you see all of these uh these liberal journalists in Tucson with you know or otherwise democracy dies in the darkness right they they love that one from the Washington Post\nWell when you don't report and for Patrick's bad answers and her bad performance at a debate do you know what the Arizona Daily Star Dylan Smith and all these geniuses did they just provided darkness\nAnd the idea that to a folks from Phoenix were part of the the journalist asking questions is possibly one of the dumbest things I've ever seen\nAnd the only news covering this other than the Arizona Daily Star staff just picking quotes was two guys from Phoenix\nWeird what am I missing out there\nReal reporters right so when they when they see what that is what always kills me right this was the whole thing up one um [noise] I went to that First Amendment thing at the last that night right you have reporters Dylan Smith\nFor delicious Caitlin Schmidt at least doesn't work okay but I got ... billing and they're all oh they're so insulted that anyone would say fake news\nRight hey guys girls you have to report the news if you do not report something that actually happened then you are playing right into what your arch enemy Donald Trump has been calling you which is fake news\nThe eye and it's funny is it's not like anchor Patrick is a friend of a lot of Democrats down here because you figure some of these reporters were friends with Dr Manhattan's right or any of these other these the five ... ran for that seat\nSo I think what's happening here too is this is not just the total abandonment of Lee is campaign by the end our see see I also think possibly that there's other they're they're seeing on the polls that it's close\nOkay might be a point or two away that maybe she was losing a little bit but at the same time maybe the money that they were going to pile into television the ones that they were done by television maybe they're seeing that that's not reaching the people that they can't get too that's my only other\nA way I can I can I can figure it out a little bit is that the money that they were going to spend to add on you know NFL football games and NCAA that kind of thing maybe that's not maybe the whatever the the demographic they want whatever sub\nSub segment of quote independents undecided independents that they need to go after maybe they're not\nThose big TV by kind of people I don't know maybe there's something else we're missing here\nAnd it's not likely it doesn't have money okay this is this isn't like you know they're not getting away from her you know right now it makes good headlines right because it makes it works out I think it's a ... I think this is good for her in a way because a little bit because I Know some people say oh\nBut maybe the Democrats won't get excited 'cause they think they already want it now David Schweikert\nWas on yesterday and he said look the time for changing people's hearts and minds are pretty much over you just need to get your side\nTo get their get their paperwork and and\nSo vote right as soon as you get your ballot I got mine yet but soon as you get one\nAnd so oh I'm so glad you said that because I I did let a few of you down during the primaries I Want to apologize one more time 'cause I got my record ... a lot of you think if you're going to early I Love the idea that you guys get it\nAnd then by the Monday after you get it it's gone and of course these Simone for primary recommendations probably got 'em out that Monday\nSo I I I let a few of your down I Want to tell you right now it is now right it is up there I blasted it out it's on Facebook right now but if you go to Dee Simone H ... dot com and go to the voting page\nYou'll find my recommendations on candidates propositions and uh and then I I did put unlike the Tucson metro chamber I did give you two suggestions for the tea with the school board\nAlright what'd you say about it have um a deck on the phone has a little perspective on\nOn this pulling the money thing are I'd bring him on let's do it they could have a nine zero twenty forty Dick morning welcome to the show\nLauren and a guy called every once in a while but I really appreciate everything you guys do like the last time this happened when Randy Graf was in the primary with tough for Huffington\nSteve Huffman who currently is the he's the government affairs guy for the association of realtors right now locally\nRight he's a great guy because I support it when you win the primary but the point is that when I stopped giving money to in our cc because don't get involved with local politics\nYou know I I Believe that strongly because we know all politics are local who said that Tip O'Neill or somebody like that\nA picture of local who said that Tip O'Neill or somebody like that\nBut where is it a Tip O'Neill or Mark Twain it's one of those one of those too [laughter] yeah\nBut that's the last time that I Know that it happened here in Pima County but I stopped giving money to shut the heck with it well\nAgain it's um you know [noise] so you're saying the N are cc pull the money on Hoffman when he went against Giffords or ... or ... the\nOther way they supported the help of an overt Randy Graf yeah but it doesn't matter which way they do it I mean let people know and they're all locality right\nNo no I like I said a cause you're what you're saying is the ... sea play favorites in a primary is what you're saying\nPrimary yeah yes and I\nI have I Do have a big problem with that I you know let the Republicans banging out and do their thing that that's my thing\nYeah that no list since she was one of the forty\nUnder forty of the same with my daughter at that time and she is a great person\nAbsolutely so ah so what do you think do you think we should but the um in relation to worry are you worried that she's not going to make it\nNo I said she will okay yeah I think she will I mean I think it lightly on that yeah yeah yeah my wife watch uh what's your name there for five minutes and said I really don't like her much and she couldn't give me a reason why but if a whole lot of ladies take that\nRight well the thing about and I have a form of Cuban inspire or any sort of confidence in that in that debate\nNo not at all well Dick thanks for the good call buddy chair it take you always good to talk to you\nSame here or have a great day I read we can do to a and Alexander a man had a good point it's funny that the Arizona Daily Star reported on the end are cc pullout faster than they reported on the debate\nHere here\nThe debate was misreported here Mark Twain candidate right those who don't read the newspapers and uninformed oh those who read them are misinformed\nDing ding\nWow or correct like I said it's by Arizona Daily Star it's news does ... nearly correct one man whole what it's it's funny and pathetic yeah that the Arizona Daily Star was faster and it got a headline in the paper and are cc pull out of the of this race\nThan actually reporting of the debate accurately good point\nSo I'm On the Donald Trump\nFake news clicker thank you very much so\nHey guy he got Arizona Daily Star thanks for proving Donald Trump right again that I'm sure you want to hear that while you're eating you're a gluten free Oreos Rob cheerios yeah so\nAll right at Alexander do goodness what little nine zero twenty four and I just saw Van Buren roll up in his car\nHe's coming up top of the hour Greek food top of the hour we're live at pottery fiesta also wrote up in Catalina just a few minutes north of oral valley\nHero valley and there'll be afraid when you get to ... make a
