deal shows is more events in Jesus' life\nProof is consistent servant who had an increase your love for him\nYou know there's another thing that I find rather fascinating about Jesus and this is a\nWonderful thing for me and it's a strange thing at the same time and that is that Jesus was not a very recognizable person now when we put our heroes together we like them all the good don't way\nBut there was something about Jesus that made him be able to get lost in a crowd\nAnd another session I talked about this because of what John the Baptist had to say in the very first chapter of the gospel of John he says about Jesus and I listen to this close like\nI didn't know and\nAnd I wouldn't have known him\nOnly had one the one who sent me in other words the father\nSaid when you see the spirit come down and remain\nI've seen and I testify this is the son of God\nWow\nHey Jesus and Jon we're cousins I thought they grow up together and studied all of this and would have breakfast every Thursday mornings I'm aware\nAnd and ... plant it out and and Jesus would ask him\nA\nJohn how do you like locus or it's time for you to start practicing locus and you need to get a camel's hair shirt that'll really make a bridge for\nBut apparently not\nAnd wonder of wanders John says I didn't know\nThere was nothing physically about him\nAll the pictures you've seen drawn not withstanding felt there was nothing physically about him\nThat would stand him apart from all other people he could be sitting among us\nI like that\nNow the reason I like that is misled me no he truly was the man you well God\nUs\nWith Mrs sense to better from some people than it is others and when I'm Around a ridiculously Hans ...\nOh standing league nor just person\nI don't feel like they're really with me it's like uh did you bring me along because you were slamming or\nOr or what but Jesus comes in a way\nThat makes us comfortable with him\nAnd the only clue\nAnd the only clue\nIs that the Holy Spirit rests upon him and he ... his giving his anointed in that passage on the annoying\nThat's giving passage what he's doing he's preaching he's hailing he's binding up broken arch he's doing things that are totally other senators clientele is rather baser sort they're\nBecause they're the ones who can't do anything for him\nExcept receive\nJesus another of the things that\nBlesses me immensely about him is the way he was patient with his ...\nWhen you look at the way these men were and and this will be a fun study by the way if you go into the scripture without any preconceived ideas and merely study the apostles\nYou can only come to one conclusion they were world class losers and it\nSeems that the very basic message of the nature of Jesus never seem to get frozen them I'm Amazed that these men\n\nI said this before but it I probably ought to repeated in every tape it I Do these men\nMore than any other single thing these apostles\nMore than anything else recorded and scripture\nThey didn't argue over deep theological questions they didn't solve the tension between predestination in free choice no they didn't bother with great arguments\nThey argue over who is the greatest and Jesus let them know that\nThere were times when he's busy doing messianic things he's blessing people he's healing people and the disciples are over here yeah yeah yeah they are letting letting people were saying\nAnd he let them do what he didn't say what you guys get your act together over there I Need help over here you embody well me at least do some ...\nI have to drink this cup\nNow the word of the top\nWords are very significant in ancient history\nIf you're aware of the life of Socrates when he had been condemned to death\nHis mode of\nExecution was\nAnd when Jesus drinks\nBoy he was drinking the death that my sins and your sins have produced the fatal poison\nThat would kill the whole human race were it not for\nAnd took our sins upon him\nI'm not going to let you same to me\nI Will not let you rescue me\nTo keep me from rescuing you\nAnd then he destroys the evidence\nThere was this year flopping around undergrad\nJesus picks it up\nPut it back on mouth is head\nAnd the evidence is his mouth as cannot even take Peter to court for assault and battery\nYou're honoring cut off my air rally which one I keep forgetting I just keep forgetting well\nBecome now\nKind of a final moment because very shortly after this\nJesus is being tried it is\nCruel a mockery of a trial you know that\nEven in the most unjustified courts\nAnd legal system's this trial would not stand up\nAnd yet Jesus never defended himself and when they brought him before pilot the most amazing thing\n\nPerson after person here and John chapter Eighteen comes to pilots with stories about Jesus with their own pictures of him their own portraits of them\nThey were all bad\nAnd the only evidence pilot has to consider about Jesus is bad habits all\nBad but you know top story\nBad story\nTerrible story\nThat you know our hearts crap we have somebody on there defending them somebody's got to be there saying that's not the right picture that's not him [noise] you know\nYou want to jump in there don't you want to say\nJesus never said a thing pilots just man I can let you go you know that I have the power\nAnd some of these charges\nJesus saying\nAnd then the most remarkable stay\nPilot has seen all of the negative pictures\nYou know what his conclusion is he looks them over\nAnd he says I find in ham\nMan my heart cries that out too I've had a lifetime of looking at pictures of Christ I have heard people say things about him that were extremely negative I'd had a chance to see all of it and often I Want to defend him\nBut I discovered that he doesn't need the fence he proved that to us\nMy heart cries out I find in him\nThey give you a little personal theory\n[noise] do you remember the rock opera Jesus Christ superstar\nIt was a view of Jesus through the eyes of Judas you under stand how they approach that through the eyes of Judas\nConsequently it had a [noise] a little bit less than through the eyes of faith bent to it\nThere were indeed some very negative parched places where they put words in Jesus mouth that we're not there and the scripture\nIf you will look back in your timeline you may notice the Jesus Christ superstar\nJust preceded the Jesus movement\nWe were all upset if that's an accurate that's got to wait Jesus was and that's true\nIt isn't but I have discovered that when the world just here's his name\nSomething happens in our\nJesus when even when I'm negative vision is produced I've been wondering negative portrait is shown of him Jesus\nI watched a movie of that\nJesus Christ superstar\nI don't know where it was filmed it could have been filmed in the desert of Southern California I think it was filmed in Israel\nBut there was a closing to that I don't know if you saw it or not but I saw it\nAnd I thought now I Know\nYou see they had finished the production\nAll of the actors in the production people were boarding\nThe buses that would take them back to town and away from the set\nThey had completed Jesus Christ superstar\nBut as each of them got on the bus and made their step up onto the bus before they took the second step\nThey pause\nAnd they look back at the hill where there happened to be three crosses that were part of their set\nAnd they just looked at it for a moment and then they didn't say anything\nBut you could tell they were thinking\nAnd then they got on the bus\nAnd then the next person would make the first step up and then just stop\nAs if reluctant to leave\nAnd the camera would follow their eyes to\nThis hill where three crosses were\nAnd then they would get on a bus and won\nAnd then they would get on the bus and one after another\nWould get on and stop and look back\nAnd I said oh Jesus\nYou know one\nThink they're looking at it through the eyes of Judas but\nEven showed us knew\nHe had killed in Iraq\nAnd Jesus Says to Peter\nI Will not let you save me\nI have to go through all the negative portrayals I have to go through all the people using my name as an expletive I have to go through all of the negative musicals and movies that will ever be made about me I have to do this\nMy heart cries out with pilot I find than him no fault\nYou can take a small little picture like I did a gym\nAnd you may not be able to tell much\nOnce you begin to see the perspective of who he is\nI think you also will find in him\nBut there's one more beautiful picture of this\n... says now on to him Jesus\nWho is able to keep you from falling and present you\nBefore the presence of its glory with exceeding July\nYou see because he paid the price he now has the power to present new to the father\nAnd say to the father\nNo fault at all\nI've got I'm covered dead\nThanks for spending this time with us if you enjoy this portion of

I mean why why\nWhy in the world should I forgive that person who hurt me so much\nYou have no idea how much they hurt me I don't you're right I don't why in the world should I offered grace to that person\n\nYou ought to do it for three reasons that's why\nNumber one\nI Need to be gracious to others I Need to forgive others who have hurt me because God has been gracious to me in fact he is gracious and a moment by moment basis\nAnd if you can't forgive you need to just positive minutes and realize how much God has already forgiven you\nBecause you will never have to forgive anyone else\nMore than Jesus Christ is already for giving you\nYou will never after forgive anyone more\nThan God has already forgiven you and maybe what you need to\nDo is just stop for a minute\nAnd consider reconsider\nThat you haven't always gotten what you deserve either\nThe God has been gracious with you\nIn the Bible says because we've been forgiven by Christ we're compelled to forgive those who hurt us this is the second reason and that is because the alternative is bitterness\nAnd we know that one doesn't work we've talked a lot about the futility of bitterness here at Saddleback\nWe've talked about the fact that the scientists tell us the most on how the emotion there is\nIs the motion of resentment\nThat it always hurts you more than anybody else it's like taking cancer are firing there are it's going to eat you up\nAnd you always hurt yourself more with bitterness than you do the other person\nWhile you're doing while you're friday while you're resenting while you're thinking of retaliation and revenge while you are rehearsing the pain all over and over and over in your mind that going on there merry way totally oblivious\nThey've dropped it you're not hurting anybody but yourself\nThe Bible says that in the book of job you're only hurting yourself with your anger\nResentment\nWill not change the past no matter how much you resent it it's not going to change the past\nAnd resentment will not solve the problem right now it isn't capable of solving any problem\nAnd resentment doesn't even make you feel better in fact it makes you feel worse it robs you of joy and allows that person in your past to continue to hurt you now and that's dumb\nBecause they can't hurt you anymore unless you allow them to buy rehearsing the memory over and over\nResentment doesn't work bitterness doesn't work\nThe Bible says in the book of\nThe British chapter twelve I Love the pill affair phrase be careful that none of you fails to respond to the grace\nWhich God gifts\nFor if he does there can very easily spring up and him a bitter spirit which\nIs not only bad in itself but it can also poison the lives of many others\nLike your children like your husband or your wife and others\nSo let it go the third reason you need to forgive that person\nIs because God expects you to do it got expects you to do it\nMatthew six Fifteen let's read this verse allowed Jesus said this\nFor if you forgive men when they sent against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men there since your father will not forgive your sense\nI don't know how to make it any clearer than the way Jesus said it right there forgiveness is a two way street\nDo not burn a bridge you got to walk across the getting to have in\nJesus Says we cannot receive what we are unwilling to give\nYou say well I can never forget that person then I Hope you never sin\n\nBecause you're going to need forgiveness to get into having\nSay ... Rick I I just don't feel like doing it will do it anyway\n\nAnd you're only hurting yourself\nNow the fact is you're going to be hurt and like that in a stylish fat it only question is what are you going to do with those hurts\nAnd if you hold on to that hurt and you let it build in your life you will end up being a\nLaurel a shriveled up better old person and your heart's gonna grow hard and you're gonna die bitter and lonely\nBecause nobody wants to be around a better person\n\nAnd something else happens it's an amazing thing that bitterness does to us if you don't release that person\nFor forgiveness if you don't release them you're going to start to resemble them\nBecause that's what bitterness that\nI never got to pay like you fell in the blank\nMy dad my mother my brother my sister my ex spouse\nNever gone to school and you focus on on the whole time you say that\nThe Bible teaches that what we focus on we move toward and what we move toward we become what you resist per se is\nYou gotta let it go\nFor your own sake you gotta let it go\nSyracuse don't understand\nI couldn't never forget that person\nI could never do that\nYou don't know how much they've hurt me I don't know that\nIs it I can never forget that person that's why you\nNeed Jesus\nYou say you can't manufacture I now live in your life to handle all the ways you're going to be hurt\nYou are going to be hurt in life\nAnd you don't have enough left over power that on your own June in Jesus Christ and you need his love in your life\nOr you're going to die a better person\nAnd you need him to fill you with\nLove not every year but every moment of the day\nWhen I was I said earlier the reason why some of you have a hard time forgiving is because you don't feel forgiven\n\nSo let's start with a prayer today which about your heads\n\nI Want to pray a prayer forgiveness than I'd like for you to follow man it\nIt's a prayer of liberation it's a prayer freedom it's a proud that can change your life\nSomebody say I've I've forgiven that person in the past why do I still hurt because you've got to keep forgetting\nUntil the pain goes away\nWould you pray this prayer in your heart\nThere Jesus Christ\nYou know that I've been hurt by others\n\nAnd you know that my resentment has made me act in ways that have been unreasonable", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "14"}
