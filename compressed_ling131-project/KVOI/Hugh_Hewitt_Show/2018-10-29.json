good to be back of your program\nIt's great to have you back give us a rundown how the race fans eight days from the vote\nWell you we have a lot of momentum going into the final stretch early voting just started on October twenty four and we're seeing a lot of it on our side as people come out to the old\nI said people across West Virginia were absolutely second by what they saw on full display in Washington this fall\nAnd they're coming out and we're dealing network growing in the polls we have some polls show that I suppose showed us up but the most important thing is that we're trying to get our message out and get a vote out in the final eight days\nThe president is coming back to West Virginia on friday just another big sites for us and there's you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia you warm with forty two\nPercent of the vote this is talk on coming back started these car we've got a big boost to the polls are I think we're right there for the stretch Ron we know that we're just or another massive amount of or a year\nAnd we just have to fight and keep our vantage over the next eight day\nPatrick Morrisey in his mind you that the desperation on the left the attempt to claim the president and it's all over everywhere this morning the president and I submitted Kevin McCarthy then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence that there's not a bomb or a semi representative Trump people\nI think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean that rhetoric because the idea that\nThis crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the pet more see a vote check what do you think\nWell look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing the mob I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because people literally going not on the other side of the aisle and I think more and more people know if Joe mansion or to get elected again\nHis first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole Schumer Pelosi Clinton obstruct\nResist impeach mop that's what it's all about and people can connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people see crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that I think that's a very motivating factor\nMore and more I think folks are understanding but these are not West Virginia conservative values they don't my record\nOn the conservative fighter jets on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protecting coal fighting substance abuse at standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and coal lifestyle you\nJoe matches the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for Schumer is a vote for the mob mentality\nNow now to finish on that point pat ... does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges\nAnd while Joe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that wreckage but\nDo voters know that if you vote for mansion you're voting for more of the cabinet or attempt to take out\nWell we've just started a couple of commercials on that I think they are or are they do that and voters are smart\nThey know that the craziness they saw that didn't come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not only Schumer and Pelosi it's Hillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton said that they can't be civil I mean that's a quote from Hillary Clinton\nI think people can connect that obviously Joe mansion doubled our supported Hillary Clinton even after she said\nShe was going to put a lot of coal miners coal company works I think they are you there bring it together because they know that this side represents a complete hundred eighty to return to go back to the Obama era Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so I feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it all the surveys\nIt's growing and growing and Joe mansion as a problem as voters out it's just going to be a big issue\nHere it is an along eight days but it will fly by good luck\nPath Morris use your brain sprint towards the end I Believe West

uh last night on the Steve felt in show he was in Pittsburgh last night calling into the show televised and saying hey\nYou can't really have a better friend than Donald Trump for the Jewish cause autism and Israel so they can say that but they really can't back it up and so it's unfortunate that we're in a situation like this now we're just gonna bustling at each other\nNow let me talk about that I'm Talking with Anthony Scaramucci his new book Trump the blue collar president bookstores everywhere also a lower third tier on on MSNBC today again this is in\nThe people who do the kind of runs aren't that people were talking so I Can't blame this on me courage oh it's just on their show Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans\nI have a Washington Post column today Anthony Scaramucci you cannot blame violence on anyone except the perpetrators of violence it is a ridiculous than I don't blame Bernie Sanders for the Alexandria softball shooting I don't blame Maxine Waters for people chasing I'm I'm Mitch McConnell or or secretary Nielsen out of restaurants\nPeople who commit the crimes are responsible but why do you make of that lower third Trump's role in stoking violence among America\nWell listen I I again I'm In New York camp I totally disagree with that you have to figure the individual but I have said just the president I said as recently as yesterday we had a conversation yesterday if some of my TV urine says\nWhy not try toned down approach because\nYou know you you're at forty seven forty eight percent or you could get yourself it in the mid fifties she's doing steady while\nOn so many different fronts 'em and why why why have a headwind on you you can use these people on me and he's on the opinion that there's no if you think of the people that they're just going to continue to come out and guns blazing no matter what he does endorsed says and reference yesterday me on the phone\nThe speech on anti Semitism that he gave on Saturday and he said it is just pick up all of that\nIn the mainstream media or and so and then I went and checked it went on to it and look around at shore the criticism was while he was the prompt or he didn't really need it so it's just you know he he is right in a lot of ways you knock and it gets a fair shake that I feel perhaps you may feel that he deserves a as it used\nTo be whether or not done yet I play three clips of the I I played three extent equipped to his Indianapolis speech denounced the anti Semitism I think it's probably the first that anyone driving to work this morning as heard them because I mean this is where I wanted to get to the ... inside and you\nA let's get our Harvard law school brains on here you know that the media has monitor\nThe law school brains on here you know that the media has monetize hating Donald Trump you know that and that's a problem that's what's going on is that a couple of cable channels have monetize hating him one is monetize loving him that Anthony is bad for America it's just a group\nThat well I told I told you that I think that you see that objective standard and the business model of these companies now fragment ain't you\nGo to people that have come from biases I think it's just going to be the issue you know when I go on time a obviously a pro Trump supporter over three hundred and four page book about what I thought the campaign short stint in the White House but how he was able to steal the base\nOf the Democratic party and I go on you know what I Would say an adversarial programming um and I just get lit up and destroyed on Twitter out and and people why the politics of personal destruction and the politics of the union station and you're you're mentioning my Harvard law school degree\nBut you know set fires was calling me like fat Tony in the\nWhite House you know and that's just what I don't understand you're you're one of the guys who came into the Trump Administration and nobody knows that\nI was I was walking pinky rang according Seth Meyers I was dead Jim and laundry Jersey Shore cash member\nAnd so I mean it's just funny I mean you're allowed to do that to a talent or not really that you get the other racial groups you know work ethic but that's fine I mean the point the point I think the more important point you\nIs that a stop this nonsense um it's just bad for our kids because if kids are going to out of the discourse and that they're going to\nPut us in a position where they're no longer are involved and I think the opposition ...\nActually what do you like fishing\n... last question Anthony before we run out on the cars you buy the present you talk to them\nI think he needs to do more television with more adversarial people like it used to go on with Anderson Cooper and that's not my network I think you had to go on with Scarborough why they got to go home with Matt I got to go everywhere because he never loses one on ones and they cannot not televised um but he stopped doing that\nDuring the campaign he was ubiquitous on every channel it every moment totally interviews on radio what do you think\nWell you go back to my calms plan I wrote a seven page ... plan that literally said exactly what you just said I was about to implement that plan on the thirty first of July and I got fired at nine thirty seven in the morning\nAnd I had been able to implement that plan would have put a big dog out here in all of those situations and I think he would definitely be gravitating way more independents as a result that's hundred percent agree

Israel as I Am and mourning those who died in Pittsburgh uh Larry iron though it never takes long for opportunity to seize on any tragedy and last night\nI'm Kevin McCarthy our friend house GOP leader was attacked by people on the left because he had weeded out before the Pittsburgh massacre\nThat George Soros Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer we're trying to buy the election which in fact they're trying to do and that's fine that's their constitutional rights but he was accused of anti Semitism for noting that I guess because those three men are Jewish and you know Kevin McCarthy I Know Kevin McCarthy\nOur ambassador to Germany with Cornell came on earlier he knows Kevin McCarthy what do you make of the charge of anti Semitism with regards to our friend Kevin McCarthy\nWell so both of us know Kevin McCarthy for many decades but what I didn't know and I bet Kevin McCarthy didn't know that those guys are all Jews\n[laughter] I bet you didn't [laughter] I didn't\nYou know really 'cause I I think in particular those three guys you know like I I didn't know George Soros was a Jew\nBut ... and everybody everybody knows about him right he's this big liberal guy gives all this money read that the truth is if you were going to insult them because they were Jews you would need to be explicit about it 'cause most people wouldn't get the joke\nThat that's it and I but of course they don't want you to get that they don't want you to understand Kevin McCarthy they want to smear Kevin McCarthy and the sphere of anti Semitism is a deep one I mean it it's along with being anti black and

... my wife's great grandfather started the synagogue in Indianapolis I I Can't abide it\nBut it is used as a cudgel does it work Larry aren't\nWell uh you know the ... I Want to say something about the depth of it is they think about the Jews that ... when you said that Walker ... which I had not heard before and that wonderful yeah\nThey get the Jews are unique in history and their unique because there is the first ancient people whose God did not disappear when the polity was defeated\nAnd they kept their God you're there X. files and this got claims to be the one God and the creator of all and then this odd claims to have a concern for everybody on earth and the the covenant with Abraham\nIs a covenant and this should be a blessing to all the people on the face of the year\nNow you won't find anything like that in the ancient religions have which Judaism as one right three thousand NBC or before\nAnd so that's the first thing but the second thing is\nBecause they uh it didn't it didn't this band when their country was overcome the promised land was overcome overcome then what they had been is an exile people for a long long time incredibly stubborn\nAnd keeping their identity\nAnd so that that places them and lots of other countries and that means the oldest opportunity for resentment of of of strangers in our midst of that you and you

and belief\nStem from that and it's got nothing to do with color\nNow I think that's what Donald Trump has to say to the world and says that a lot and has been saying that I looked it up before the election back for decades\nAnd so if you say that your enemies are acting bad in the end and you know he says that hard right one of the reasons the political ... the political debate is so intense\nIs it now it's a real fight\nAnd Trump does fight like with like\nIn the sense that he denounces people you know really clear but I don't think you know racist way\nAnd he does not call for violence ... for his victory that he really wants to win the Senate he really wanted to win Brett Kavanaugh he really wanted the tax cuts he really wants to win like you said you'll get sick of winning\nBut he doesn't call for violence in the intimation that he does the idea that chance or somehow car chases are hurling insults are like hurling rocks\nThat is a vanity of the left and the

addressing and it just made the point that there'd been some lynchings\nAnd they weren't all black and uh although there were so\nAnd so he he makes the point that if you stream out into the street
