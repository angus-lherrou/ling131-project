rhetoric that Afghan\nGovernment programs that began to deal with the corruption of the reality that began to distribute a progressive income tax that began to put government programs in to help to bring up that that safety underneath eventually going into the new deal and FDR and something's happened in the last couple of decades\nThat took that middle class that grew after World War two and sustained us allow people to buy a home a lot of kids to go to public school and it's been gradually diminishing the gap has been going great writers have obesity is less and less\nThe gas is less important than the ability on the mobility doesn't allow you to rise to the system than the halls democracy which pending are I think is under siege and it's this theory is if that is manifesting itself now\nThe symptoms of our polarization the symptoms of our you know are terrible rhetoric right now in the course of the language\nIt's just like cause really and we have to keep remembering and until the economy can have more equitable distribution of the natural wealth of the country to the people who are working for it and it's got to be clearly an underlying fire that's ready to be put in line with any moment\nAnd then I Believe a new era of trust boxing is we're on the cusp of a new are protesting that could only be avoided if\nThe tech titans distribute there not their money they can keep your mind but distribute their jobs in places where they are in need that's why that Google going in Arbor is such a great idea why hope\nAmazon goes to Columbus or Virginia or some place that needs a lot of jobs let me turn to the end of leadership in turbulent times because it was there we find\nMaybe the best friends with since the current era and President Trump you write about Lincoln TR FDR and LBJ the fame they craved the recognition they thought\nBears little resemblance to today's cult of celebrity\nFor these leaders the final measure of their achievements would be realized by this is the key you are there and mittens tuned in during place in communal memory before we talk about President Trump and that goal what is an enduring place in communal memory I think I Know what it is but you explain\nI think what it means is that at a certain point when a leader goes into politics they go in and perhaps for themselves at the start at a certain point it gets transferred into an ambition or the greater good you accomplish something that will stand the test of time\nThat normally means something that create more economic opportunity and a greater degree of social justice\nWe know when we look back at our leaders what happened during their era did people be able to share more in the country's\nGood did people feel better at the end that something had happened in their lives that they had more opportunity it's not hard to figure it out or was there a war that was prosecuted that has to be one it was like the depression that has to be lifted off and the leaders of go into communal memory\nBy those who have great challenges to face that's what Abigail Adams that great assessed each create great virtues but not always so that they are up to those challenges though sometimes they can go into\nI always felt that they are up to those challenges so sometimes they can go into every in a very negative way and James Buchanan but the president when the country was falling apart in the Eighteen fifty and less on the able to exacerbate the problem is rather than have them and he goes down as one of the worst part of history I'm not sure that um\nThat Herbert Hoover was capable of his given his temperament of dealing with a depression is extraordinarily good man but how to fix ideology but he's faced the same challenge that FDR was FDR goes down and you know memory as a Teddy Roosevelt and asked if he ever have Lincoln and even as Lyndon Johnson having faced All right as a southerner\nAnd made his conviction that the civil rights bill it'd be his first priority risky tough that memory of civil rights will go down even though the white yet novel that way yeah scar and his like I say it was not celebrities not doing what you want at that moment it's not just\nCampaigning it's really going forward and mobilize in the country what tasks that will make the country and the people like that or if it's a big thing and and that's if that's your desire it somehow lift you left off their daily struggle\nArguably the greatest leader Americans had in terms of the longest period of time would be like a leader of a ... D Day invasion a leader of shape a NATO\nLeader Columbia University of course eight years in the White House during a period of time when the Soviets reached parity with us on the hydrogen bomb and we had to begin a recognition of the new world order with a nuclear age I could pull that off but I don't really think has a place in our communal memory yet Doris Kearns Goodwin do you\nI think it's missing place I think there will be more biographies device now\nI think the way he handled the presidency and that dignity that he brought to it and clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginning of the Cold War\nI I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation or takes the biographies written about the person to put their whole life is you just didn't know she lamented ... not just but he did his presidency but what his whole life meant to be\nAnd yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of time and sometimes it looking back on an era from the context of our own era of the relatively few of the Nineteen fifties I think so so much at us now and we don't take it for granted\nThe way we might have ... now that we've had a period of such perpetual war on our side\nSimilarly the looking back on Lyndon Johnson ability to deal with Congress get I've partisan support for nature legislation not great civil rights laws that Medicare PBS NPR immigration reform\nAnd most importantly bringing both Republicans and Democrats together in our broken political system that looks so much better what we took for granted Doris Kearns generation but I say I said how is it for ... definitely ready for great leadership daffy\nDoris Kearns Goodwin west question about leadership and turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump his numbers are improving is change the Supreme Court he's won the third year battle for the Supreme Court military being rebuilt the economy's humming along\nBut of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming Trump pretty pipe bomb that Sarah what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years into the next to impossible sex\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he helped to do and that in trying to reach out to expand the base not just elf debate and try and become the leader of all the people that's a huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes people are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important I mean the feeling better even about the confidence economy they feel better as citizens right now\nThey feel that the country it's more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see something on television that they wish they weren't seeing\nThat sense of feeling good about being a citizen as a country on it's another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years\nAnd simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well so we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to\nUse that as a standard for its leader leading us in a direction that is helping us become better country\nOr is or the discourse and he's not only response before but it's just escalating under his watch and when he joined about\nDoris Kearns Goodwin direct thank you for coming and joining

he wouldn't let him do worse so Gary that's ... that's an amazing John ... story what I Need to know is for ed right now he was going to play a song for you know what ... what do you want\nA ... close to the edge\nAll right we're going to do a Siberian cartridges you want to do it okay I don't get me going the smoking so Gary thanks for your thanks for sharing that John Anderson story and the other important stuff\nAlready of all the stuff\nYou'd better miscarried down ... very much gear seven nine zero two zero four zero the phone number wake up to sun and Gmail dot com\nYou mean the butlers the Obamas butler is not picking up the mail at the er at the mailbox right there's a lot of things you don't go out and get the mail\nOr wherever whoever sent these things to anybody right if they really I mean if it really was someone who wanted to put fear in the critics of the president right\nLike the press is is going on about Mika lost her mind today on MORNING Joe\nOkay is are in the end you're just ...\nThose people don't those people don't an\nNinety nine percent of those people that are mentioned this is they don't do any of that\nThey're not that they haven't touched their own mail in Twenty years you think Hillary Clinton opens around now\nOh here's one from a friend yeah Robert fan\nRight yeah [noise]\nAt the same time Gary alright if these OK so first that there's two ways right either if it went through the mail\nBe overly subsidized post office it's just mailing bombs out the people left and right there and didn't know it there's motions in protocol and you actually scan stuff right\nThey looked like they weren't envelopes like an envelope with a bomb in it that had glass in it and that what they're saying I don't know was\nA bomb or they knew it\nYeah okay All right so that so so so so either it's unbelievably easy to mail bombs nowadays [noise]\nGo I'm just saying right either like post nine eleven you can still mail bombs all over the place\nI'm not not just being inquisitive right yeah then Gary makes up for a guy makes a good boy and his brother\nRight yeah then Gary makes up for a guy makes a good boy and his brother to burn up a point in the works for people in California and make it a lot of money is all these people have security cameras all over the place now these were not put through the mail is there something on video\nWill have to say it's it's fresh just as it's what's his this started happening what twenty or thirty six hours ago that's why we have to talk about mental November sixth and there will drop but don't worry we'll drop it won't be getting bored\nSo I I I checked it out to the you know part of the inner circle here and I said I might be too cynical by thinking\nWithin two weeks of an election day\nThat there's just as likely instead of someone trying to put fear and punish the president's critics that this was some crazy Democrat who wants to do it wants to create sympathy for Democrats\nCome on because we don't know\nRight so then the latest October surprise there more to come more than another warning\nJoe was freaking out this morning because the president in a tweet this morning of course said that the press needs to clean up their act\nYeah right yeah and how dare he go after this revered institution during this time the other thing they were I I just wanted to go so often they had their their their their stiff is sitting in front of the White House right one of the questions came up to the guy and MSNBC\nOr did the president ... to the people got again we're rocking and Billy Boy right and just did he call President Clinton and Barack Obama to ask them if they were okay\nAnd then he's going to get to the bottom of this and the report it goes well not to my knowledge did he call for the like he can't even do that\nYou already made a damn statement yesterday afternoon was pretty damn strong to [laughter]\nGet thrown off the air you keep this stuff up this is this is horse\nLoni um this stinks again come on tell me something they need to know you know give me some give me some news that affects my life your life listener your life tell me something I really need to know\nToday this is this so this is play again I can sit there and talk about it now if if they really find out that there is a guy or gal or group who really wanted to put the fear in the president's\nThen I'll be the first got to come out\nUntil we know anything right\nAnd so we know anything there's just as likely of a case of a Democrat who sent these out to promote sympathy and give the press something to talk about during the ... election\nMika was going nuts how dare you go after this institution during this time of crisis you guys are part of the crisis\nBecause you want to kill Trump I got it you can't but I you\nGuys are still in shock you can't believe Hilary lost you told the whole world that Hillary has gotten a limb\nYou guys had it's so easy with Iraq\nSo were you were crying when ... left and you thought oh look at the Hillary is going to walk in another eight years the Republicans split up this freak with the orange hair and the Republican Party is going to go into the woods\nNone of their trickled down from a small government crap works\nWell look what happened Holly would\nThe orange haired freak won the election Nate Silver or the guy who said that a Hillary or was it was already the ... the Democrats are taking back the house a couple of days ago Mr five thirty eight ten thirty wherever the hell is he you know he's a big scientists stat guy\nYou know he ah if you look back he had Hillary by eighty percent chance of winning the election a couple of days before or the night before election day or two years ago\nSo everything you thought was wrong your entire world was turned upside down\nTrump comes out swinging ... says the magic phrase fake news\n\nAnd you guys stopping journalists you did and the best one is you are so frantic about screaming to the world that democracy dies in the darkness not realizing that you were part of the shrouding of the truth\nAnd it's not like I'm saying you guys know why you do two things one\nYear absence of what you what the absence of facts that you put in your stories tells a lot\nI see it all the time\nI listen to NPR on a regular basis and I have a story that I Know that I covered early in the morning and looked at a couple of different sources the NPR guys will just the ones that they don't want to hear they just don't talk about or I remember on the Iraq days right now\nHe he would come up with some thing right or you know some plan or you know whatever big government thing and they will go in Morocco Obama wants to help American orphans ...\nDying and blah blah blah but that's how I got it and then instead of and so they have a long for rock quote or Nancy Pelosi quote right and then instead of having the Republican give your answer they would go and the Republicans disagree next story Lakshmi Singh say right exactly so all of you\nI mean what what what's this morning if I go to the Arizona Daily Star page right\n'cause they they hate Trump to hey I I forgot to tell you guys you didn't endorse Hillary or Trump two years ago did you ... you remember that when you missed that one guy that's\nAll right now is already off they use that they had the breaking news thing on this morning across in read about how you know people are thinking that the bombs are because of Trump's rhetoric of course right or no again locally we've already pointed out you're ...\nYou're not journalists you're not I I Know you guys WON Awards now some of your journalists Caitlin Schmidt journalist hang Stevenson who quit now leaving to go back to Phoenix he was a journalist but the rest of you\nDon't give both sides you're not even trying any more\nSo when I see the press crying about why is Trump going after the press you're also part of the problem\nTrump and and in in his rhetoric is part of the problem Nancy Pelosi Hillary Clinton Eric Holder Maxine Waters problem\nPress part of the problem\nYou have to be consistent and persistent but you're not consistent\nHow many times that we bang on you about the um the tea you as the employee that threatened Martha Nick Sally\nRight\nYou guys didn't you kinda get but the idea that there was no cry it wears the civility ...\nDisability thing only works if you kind of keep doing it\nSo again so probably shoot it all the all the senators playing baseball I don't know but this is what happens right\nWe only start talking like this one bad things happen\nRight so these bombs show up I still don't know who sent it let's talk about even like these school shootings right every time we have a school shooting they all try to say the right thing but don't do anything in between\nWell other than Gabby and mark fundraise\n\nSo this is why I Can't take any of these people seriously with their now calls for unity and all this stuff because they don't do it\n\nOh there we go again\nI just found it I ... I live in Georgia and it didn't come up on mine when I brought up to sun dot com\nBut a ... pipe bombs again raise quite dishonest our\nQuestion on whether Trump has fan political passions the dangerous levels of Associated Press story now here's the real story if you want to quote okay look at some of the of Andrew Cuomo said over the last ... or right oh okay\nIt it it would be going back to the this let's just show me the headline so I Would have said um bombs again raise question on whether Trump and Democrats have fanned political passions yeah both thank you\nBoth sides say this is when you see this coverage yeah it's politics it's not journalism gp\nThey've got slang everybody has this one member Hillary Clinton said you can be crappy to them are Republicans until after we won the house in his right then you can go back to being nice remember that one they're not talking about that six days later still talking heads again she still thinks he's running for president\nGood what country was chewy center to\nLet's um let's take some phone calls in before we go to break seven nine zero twenty forty by contract\nOut this is like I say if this works when I'm a door takes over on next Thursday is Terry still get put to the front of the line\nI probably ah what can you show comes on ...
