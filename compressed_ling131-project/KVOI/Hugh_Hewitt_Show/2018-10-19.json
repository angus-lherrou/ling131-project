dialogues I think I've ever conducted with Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College all things Hillsdale Hillsdale\nDot edu because there is a broad and the political discourse a really dumb argument and it's a hard life is hard but it's harder when you're stupid and it's really hard when you do not understand what the Senate is about and I have seen it everywhere doctor on that the Senate is a deeply offensive institution\nWhen in fact it is the the the tendons spent hold the country together and we were talking about why New York didn't want a Senate and why bridging you didn't want a Senate but we had to have a Senate in order to have a republic please continue\nWell eight in the Oregon and Virginia and Massachusetts big big powerful states they were very reluctant about a strong central government in general right and then and then the Senate protecting the little states\nThat was you know that of course they didn't want that and they you know and it it before you emphasize\nThat interest drove all of these discussions too much there's a way that they came together for ratification that this proves that I mentioned that in a minute\nBut of course right now you know they're trying to they're trying to unite the country and they ... and that that's a ... 'cause you have to think back to the fact that this had never been done before\nNobody had ever built the country like this this this started out with the basic principle which it's born and then expand that to the consent of the govern made necessary by that principle this is the first thing in the world in human history to undertake that\nSo so they uh they uh\nSo they have to you know they're going to figure out a way to do it and you know if you think now you know that big countries of the great little you know but the truth is they art right the European Union is an attempt to unite the European continent\nAnd it's falling apart right and China has got intermittent at this assemblies of itself right and the Russian Federation you know is strained at the corners right\nAnd so and and yet these big powerful countries have a better a means of defending themselves and the small weak countries you know if you want to keep your independence for sure and certain for the rest of the time\nYou don't really want to be Belgium 'cause they've managed to survive\nBut it took some really big countries getting on their side to help that happen yeah so how do you hold them together right and this is you know this is the American experiment right and remember this and that was conducted on a new continent right never been anything like didn't know how big it was you know I think much about it really\nAnd so they so they uh their idea was local thing will be governed cheaply by local things\nAnd then the Senate becomes a protection in the national thing of the prerogative of the local things and that that device is a powerful um it's a powerful a protector\nYou know you need you need to explain that again it becomes a powerful national interest in the protection of local interest put your hand on that\nWell it was better when the Senate was ... was appointed by state legislatures although I confessed filled the Senate was often not very important in that time because first of all it wasn't just black and big federal government\nWith the ability to reach into every town I mean there's a federal institution installation basically in every town\nAnd they do they don't just do the post office anymore\nNow there's you know local and private things of all kinds that are that are that are that are influenced by the federal government and so that that wasn't possible when the Senate was\nChosen but the state legislatures and I would go back to that although I think there's little prospect of it 'cause I think that would be a really good uh um\nYeah we're not going to I Would I we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against it can mentioned the states as a matter as well but when we come back we're gonna continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution\nNot on any particular decision the decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it triggered on the left a mad cap rushed\nTo denounce the Senate and we stand here as we always do it every Friday at this hour with Dr Larry on the Hillsdale dialogue reminding people there were rumors ones and they were people on genius said too [noise]\nPortions of the huge your brought you in part by patriot mobile [noise]\n\nYou're in the middle\nA nonstop action packed information [noise] issues you assure this coming right back [noise]\nYou see my head in the day of battle amen based on a true story of an army chaplain and his wife and I only stand before you today because Jesus as my wrong because I have a family who loves and believes is\nOne marriage one family under God he may be I'm not preaching family\nPowerful ...

Kevin uh she shouldn't be acceptable\nFor a thousand four hundred law professors yeah ... you\nKnow but what about that right I mean aren't they supposed to be people who are trained and then train others that before you're gonna you know believe a bad thing about anybody you should try to prove it yeah and that and you know you need evidence right and uh and then you have to have because\nIt's funny you know in in the American legal system the bedrock of it is not judges and lawyers it's juries right ordinary people and they make the ultimate decision\nAnd it is no accident I Wish to underscore this that when the ... composition of the Supreme Court was up for the the people in Philadelphia to decide they gave the president the power to nominate and the ... Democratic Senate equally state represented set up the right to confirm and the house was excluded from that process\nAnd I think it was because Dr aren't they did not want the majority and influence on the people who would be making the laws\nThat's right that's right and well you know 'cause I remember the whole point\n... you can't say that without also adding the point that that ultimately it is the people in their majority who should rule\nAnd so how do you set up a system where there is deliberation and debate and ultimately the people will and if if if\nAt AO any people by the way if you if you look at a mob anywhere in the world what you're saying is a bunch of human\nBeings who are capable of the bank\nHas and and so you need a system for them to participate in\nThat will respond to that good behavior and not to they're marching in the street you know I read an article on the fact that having a family a long time ago that the Palestinian authority\nOr when they got their government their parliament set up they passed a law that it was the death penalty to sell the land land in the west bank to you\nAnd then apparently a court of them left the place and marched down the street with a bunch of others and arrested some people and beat them and that I think they might have killed one of them right so you know that this is the mob and ... you can't have that and that's\nAnd so this idea that it's just you know it's ... right there and had a way with words he said in all cases majority rule but for the rule to the rightful it must be reasonable and protected the rights of minorities\nAnd that when we come back for the final segment of this week's Hillsdale dialogue is what will focus on how does the majority rule even when you have an anti majority turning institution like the Senate\nAnd the answer will be they rule constitutionally through mediating institutions that are designed exactly and functioning exactly they were designed to do and no

what what are you doing\nNow the other thing that they want to cry about Wright was a bill that would have to you as the cells Santa Rita\nTo veil and they and what's interesting is that everyone needs to know that first of all we know to use the has amazing plummeting enrollment okay yep and I think Senator Reid has a school that's built for about two thousand kids\nTwenty one twenty two hundred actually\nAll right and then how what's the current enrollment roughly of center is approximately\nTwenty one point five percent of capacity so you're talking maybe four hundred and fifty students\nAll right so I have four hundred and fifty kids running around the twenty two hundred capacity school basically\nCorrect so their costs for students to maintain that facility is enormous compared to a school that's over capacity like Tucson Hi ah I've talked to a Mr Trujillo Dr Trujillo sorry I'm about what they're going to what they want to turn it into a vote tech school which is great I'm I'm a big fan of uh the vocational education\nBut at the same time I said well what do you what would you be what's your capacity at that point he said well we expect maybe to max out at a thousand students which is still only fifty percent right so uh unfortunately to that that the Santa Rita high schools\nGrade are rating is has gone from ... to an F unfortunate\nSo I got a failing school of four hundred kids in a two thousand school building and your effort to possibly work at that uh they could move it over to bail\nRight really well actually an insanity to was to be the high school for the veil arena that arena was only a A R K ate a school district and so now they've expanded they're doing great things they've got a couple of high schools\nThey need another one and so the idea was very simple save the taxpayers money and give the best opportunity for the students\nI I got a point this out because the Arizona Daily Star has this ability to just make me giggle a little bit right like the thing about somehow this other guys into supporting police and you're not even though you actually have a bill that delivered for a million dollars like one of the things they didn't like about the center of the high school though\nThis is from the Arizona Daily Star okay it's going to hurt to you as the taxpayers [noise]\nWell I mean first of all the Arizona Daily Star being worried about taxpayers hilarious yeah the idea that they've said nothing about all the abuse of the tax payers by the ... the the school board and folks for the last twenty five years now all of a sudden Sarah and the crew at the paper they're big to us the taxpayer advocates yep\nA well but the the cracks ramifications would be a challenge to be quite honest you know between the bonds that go back and forth between the two districts one of the arguments was and and I put forth a number it was ten cents on the dollar and everybody at about how they got all upset about that and I said well that's that's a negotiation point it's not necessarily cast and\nIn stone at this point threat it's it's a negotiation point and what they've also Dennis ... that he wished he had set of presidents on previous sales of property when they wouldn't sell them to charter schools or private schools\nBut they would sell it to developers for ten cents on the dollar so they go right that sounds like a reasonable starting point right and then perhaps a veil that worked out they all wanted it or they could buy it and then they'd have to go in and retrofit a bunch of stuff too which is still cost a bunch more money\nBut any way that there was a lot of gnashing of teeth about oh it's our school you can't take our school away and like I still go back say ... who's concerned for the students my idea is\nThey also a growing good great district and and I said before I go to too much further ... has some marvelous schools we have some really really good schools\nBut unfortunately that any one of them and we need to be looking at the dollars and cents commonsense to figure out what's going to be the best for the students and the best of the tax\nBill I got I got a school district with no failing schools right and they're probably between them and ... the two best districts and southerners\nWell I got to brag on to take a verdict 'cause that's where I ... valley is it's got a great district\nThey had a couple of little waiver this last one through that's true I Love you Carlos now uh now the other thing is that so I got one of the two best school districts in in in southern Arizona and I have a one that has a lot of failing schools raise enough sense to you as the and this was a total bona fide F.\nAnd and the and the voters of the parents have spoken in relation to escaping the sinking ship right so the idea that the kids that are still there or you live somewhere near there how this whole thing would work but somehow they could go to a school to make their lives better rather than the better that is not supposed to be the better outcome bats\nThat was my idea was a ... number one is the open enrollment is causing an exodus from that arena because the school is not performing well so the kids who live right next door to the school maybe opening rolling into vale or ... or wherever they end up going so if if that district perhaps were to pick up that school those kids could stay home\nAnd walk across the street and go to a great school\nYour your friend knew in your family members had like a substance abuse problem for a lot of years and they just keep doing kind of bad things and because they never let them know when they hit bottom that's right that's the U.S there well there's no one that hit bottom it's ... I I look at us\nA white issue they they don't they don't want to give up they don't want to say hey we're not doing so great let's let's fix this\nNo I'm On their team that I Know I take a lot of heat they say oh you're attacking one particular board member nameless keep saying I keep attacking us she said I'm not attacking I just wanted accountability and transparency is like the desegregation forum I tried to put on\nA that everybody bailed on because they don't really want to talk about forty years worth of sixty million dollars a year additional taxes\nOn the taxpayer into you asked me to pay for the sec when you say well why why aren't they fixing it well if you had an extra sixty million dollars a year would you want to fix that yeah really I mean\nYou and our talking right before the air um 'cause right now when we're in the middle of early ballots season right\nAnd we just talk with David Schweikert yesterday and he basically said if Republicans show up like they're supposed to win vote absolute good things will happen absolutely but if you're a select certain people that I Know wink wink who still have their a ballot underneath their water bill over there All right\nBut you were saying that you have people who get early this but they think they have they they must walk them in on election day what is the problem with that\nWell the problem with that as it becomes a provisional ballot and provisional ballots counted absolutely last they count the early ballots first poll ballots next and if the margin is is a\n... within a certain parameter they will count those going into the to finalize the election but if the spread is broad enough they're actually not counted until the election is over\nSo if you don't if you don't turn in your ballot it put it in the mail\nAnd and carry it technically your vote really doesn't count until after the elections over\nSo and I know people don't trust the post office for some reason this conspiracy theory that the postman are are taking the Republican ballots out of the male and destroying them are trashing him somewhere but I've seen those ... my son votes absentee or early ... rather\nAnd um I've seen those on books because I get one for him I don't I'm a ... I like going well and you can confirm whether or not\nThey got it absolutely with the reporters off absolutely so not like it yeah we eat they they have a daily terror sheet that you can check and see if your ballot went in and there's a way to check that online\nBut I'm the I don't think the postman do that they they are so many yellow envelope 'cause they don't know which ones to grab course not and so I think that's that's a misnomer if you if you really don't want to stick it in your mailbox in your front yard you might drop it in one of the ... one of the big boxes out in front of a\n... I don't like mail in ballots yep I think it's about mail in ballots should be what they originally are which are absentee ballots yup All right or you really have some sort of physical problem that you can't get to a poll right but other than that if you can't get through a poll on election day have a nice day there's\nPlenty of people who will book out I'll pick people up I'll take 'em\nHey I remember the city wants to all bell mail and and I heard Karan lick that paragon of virtue say we're doing this to save taxpayers dollars and I said wow when she's saying that you should never go on ballot [laughter] All right what's the what's the website for talk lot built their\nWebsite WWW tc the number four easy dot com tc for easy dot com\nOr it's a good thing and good luck express dot clapped altered running for the Arizona house of representatives in El deeds and when we come back um we got food coming up at the top of the hour and a but I Will give you those ever I was going to do it but we're going to do those um [noise] census numbers on how much money people really do or don't make in the city of Tucson", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "19"}
