you know where a manufacturer of all kinds of a a consumer\nAppliances and commercial plants as in one of our big customers a very very famous American retailer\nOr sent out a letter just recently and said hey look we're not going to accept any price increases because the terrorists are going to accept any prices are just because they're just as a company that you know very well but everybody knows very well very omnipresent here in the United states\nAnd um and their reasoning was was that the arm the the Chinese currency has depreciated\nMore than ... percent this year and so therefore since there's been this appreciation of the currency you know we're not going to accept price increases because the Chinese currency is worth less the American currency is worth more\nAnd you're a supplier so go back to the trying to factories and tell them you're not going to pay any more than you used to when they're local currency and if you're buying in dollars get big discounts\nAnd pass that discount to us\nSo it's it's pretty fascinating what's going on and uh we all knew that the Chinese government would use their currency in order to try to offset the tariffs\nThe problem is is that almost all American manufacturers are American manufacturers who by components in raw materials or American dealers distributors wholesalers and manufacturers of white finished goods from China or buying in dollars\nSo therefore this currency devaluation doesn't help you if you're buying and dollars you got to buy an R. and B. but the Chinese only export their products in R. and B. because they want to get their dollars\nSo now that's the conundrum the American\nCustomers big retailers and that people are selling American brands who make products overseas specifically in China are saying hey look we know that this a currency devaluation has occurred is now your job to go get it and pass it on to us very very interesting so what do you think about that\nWell you know this is not new I mean this is the game that China's been playing all along I mean and this is what Trump is running on and he said you know the Chinese are manipulating the currency in and we got to deal with this\nWell they are and how do you know so if the tariffs right now or most of the terrorists are ten percent of the currency has been preceded by ten percent they're trying to governments basically telling us manufacturers\nYou know when the Americans come and ask for discounts you know we're helping you to give those discounts so you do not forfeit your market that you work so hard and so many years and made such a huge investment in by the way employees\nMillions of our citizens that you know we didn't want them to be out of work 'cause now I was going to be a big problem for us you know you know they're going to blame it on us nobody's got a job because you know we can't get to do get a deal done with America\nI'm so now let our currency devalue and you don't see that story a lot you know being played out right now\nUh you know so China is basically hiding behind the currency but how far will that go and then I think that's partially why President Trump has said okay well next year the Turks going to go from ten to twenty five percent\nSo you know what's China's gonna are they going to appreciate their currency by twenty five percent you know that's going to get pretty ugly very fast and then you'll definitely started hearing a lot more about\nCurrency manipulation and all of these other things\nWell as it becomes relevant you know one of the reasons you don't hear about currency manipulation is that it's not sexy envy people don't understand it so you have to say things in terms of soundbite and and we start talking about currency manipulation which you understand very well because you bring products from China and you have things going back and forth all the time you do you know mutual business there\nYou you get it but the average Joe and Jane just don't get it well what they do work for the for the for the talking heads on some of the stations like MSNBC CNN and so forth are those folks are listening\nBut what it does matter to the door to the folks are especially on main street that if the cost of you know they're just they're daily necessities and just the things that they want in life you know to make them happy you know for quality of life you know to have you know a a a better TV you know the latest technology and more or or\nOr Walmart or you could get sneakers cheaper Walmart you can get genes ... cheaper at Wal Mart and get products made over there so families with multiple children in in\nIn in in certain socioeconomic strata have the ability to share on the American dream and the products that they want I get that and when they started having trouble having\nThat Neal then it goes to main street and guess what all of a sudden they're going to find ways to you know explain in a very late terminology what currency manipulation mean vc divvy Harris\nWell when they're going to get a really well what\nChina is doing their ... their currency to keep American prices low\nI mean isn't that something that China government is manipulating its currency to offset the U.S tariffs so the U.S consumer doesn't have to pay more for their products\nSo the American consumer continues to buy their products and not go to somewhere else and it's it's kind of interesting how you kinda see these plots in sub plots and how these all these things are connected are very fascinating to me very very fascinating but\nBut rich you know let's not forget that over half of what we buy from China are components raw materials some assemblies\nThat American manufacturers by to put into their manufactured products for products that we call made in the u._s._a.\nNow made in usa product has foreign components I mean it's a they do I mean just about anything you do have you know it's made its engineered it's it is producing United States is still has mark in front of a lot of those components come from China\nSo we are hurting our manufacturing community let me tell you I'm American manufacture I'm getting hurt as an American manufacture hiring American workers because the cost of my components are going up and nobody can give us any certainty what's going to happen in the future that is not good\nWell and and that is what you all that gets back to the quick question who's going to blink first I mean you think about that is\nGoing to be over here in terms of our our our our ... at the University of they were buying their product or is it going to be an China when they're saying wait a minute we can't afford unemployment because that's not going to go well for us so it's really it's a it's an incredible game of chicken deal\nHave added a level of uncertainty that they had not had to manage through before uh obviously the apparent resolution of the agreement which has a successor to NAFTA if indeed all that works out as well as a let's say every one hopes are most people hope\nUh that takes some uncertainty out of the equation but clearly as I think you've already said\nThe a burgeoning disputes with China are are a essentially potentially huge and we frankly just don't know how that works out\nIs is really great talking to you you really analyze this very well you explain it very well we're very

together with the host Dr rich rough and the rich you know I mean this is really fascinating\nTo see what's going on politically in our country right now I mean it's really really crazy stuff I mean just a a week ago we're talking about a blue wave a blue wave I mean it was edited a book when I mean it wasn't only the house but now it's the Senate and you know then that means all these impeachment things and all that crazy stuff\nMeanwhile the president's out they're creating this economy that we just talk about for the last forty five minutes or so about you know all of the wonderful things happening with job creation trade agreements and so forth\nAnd uh you know our jobs our jobs are entrepreneur is our small business owners I mean the amount of wealth has been created in this economy for just people who have pensions people retiring better I mean so many great things are at risk but now we're talking maybe about a red wave\nImagine how to read when this whole cabinet all thing I think is turned a lot of people want money Richard Nixon talked about the silent majority I think the silent majority has been totally turned off by this wacky nuts\nAnd I'm In me that I was kind of a red wave coming coming on the show right now is former Trump campaign advisor Michael ... Bhutto to give us some order in all of this\nMarket work on the made in America thanks a lot for having me so I could we possibly see a runway now\nWell you know I was just hoping and praying for the cancellation of the blue wave so I don't want to ask for too much but this uh this whole Kavanaugh debacle has really early for that appears to really\nUh uh you know blown back on the Democrats you look at the national public radio embarrassed Paul this morning and all this big enthusiasm gap with claim some months back was going to carry the Democrats onto a surf board on this blue wave it seems to have disappeared completely\nAnd if you look at some of the cross tabs with somebody other polls that have been done it's a lot to do with the whole Kavanaugh saying that they cooked up\nAnd uh it's a it's a blowback that nobody predicted you know I don't want to say there's going to be a red wave\nBecause it's traditional as you know that during the mid term elections after a new president's election but the new president will likely lose control of one of the houses are both houses of Congress\nBut you know we talked about you know we talk about the deplorable as the people who you know the all you know you talk about the silent majority I guess they're called a deplorable now you know the authors never identified them and they predicted a Hillary Clinton landslide but you know these deplorable as we were worried that they would not come out\nIn twenty eight team because they were out as a surprise for Donald Trump and without the president on the ballot they might not come out but\nHis campaign rallies and this terrible a problem that the the the Democrats created in this Kavanaugh confirmation seems to live in them and I'm also at least we keep the house I think I'd pray for red white and but I wasn't expecting\nYou know what I find interesting and this whole scenario is the fact that it's Trump the bottom line is it's Trump and Trump has shifted the paradigm dramatically in the last election cycle\nFirst of all going up you know in a group of Seventeen coming out on top of that and they're going after Hillary Clinton going after the Democrats going after the there was a rhinos in in the never trumps in the in the Republican Party going\nYou have to at all the media so\nWe're in a different place than we've ever been in a long long time in this country I think you're right and Michael I think we have so galvanize the deplorable group but I'm One of them even though I'm I'm In norms too well educated but I'm a deplorable human being I have at least do X Y Z they'll tell you that crowd of that as a matter of fact\nBut but but the truth of the matter is I think Michael I think we've galvanize that silent majority\nWe re energized which I don't think the Democrats were counting on not happening they did the opposite of that because now you're starting to see the numbers pumping really good and by the way raft means and came out today Trump is over he's fifty percent approval rating\nAs we're talking on the show right now\nFifty percent unrest means in right now\nSo we are not Michael I I agree with you or not in the same place do I do I think we're going to have a red wave God I Hope so I don't know if I can hope for that I Want to keep what we've got\nAnd I think I think you've got this country and such a fighting

I. bill from army service\nSo I was able to get an education and uh it uh it was very important and it's very important to all of us I talked to a lot of kids groups are these days and\nTry to instill in them the importance of just staying in school another week whatever it is if you get out you don't feel like you can spend four or five years in college a spin one years if you can't do that's been one semester\nBecause every day will pay off for you every day that you can get the more formal education you get the better you be\nSo uh yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much ah ah as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook or play the good role and what we're able to do\n[noise] well it's it's a it's obviously affected you in some positive way many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are entrepreneurs entrepreneurial almost from the beginning once you're\nRight I I I've uh hours I didn't even know how to spell the word was much less a\nA a understand what he was what I was always fascinated about how things work out as a how does it Gabby a banker after you get to how how does this happen or how does it get I get to own his own business or whatever the business is I was always fascinated by it always tried to\nTo watch him understand as much about it as I could and I still have that same fascination uh today is approach age of Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated about abdominal\nOr how Mr del up with Michael Dell up and often a a a\nDuck on a building computers and found a way to out do everybody in the world it's fascinating I still try to learn about all those things\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say hit us all the time they say well you know what they did before you can't duplicate or replicate today my my opinion is you could make much bigger fortunes much faster dwell in today's world ...\nWell I totally agree and and there's another key element that\nThat you've had such a such a premium these days are being young uh gives you an advantage\nNot a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that ... are are just so positively or for all of the young people that are that are coming in and tackling the various elements of\nOf careers in one way or another because there is a premium on youth and\nAnd ah it shows so I think that I I think we're living in the very best of times we should understand that and uh we should we should say that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs created I'm I'm selling peanuts but I think you learned a couple of valuable lessons side of that talk about that I did\nI learn the lesson that or\nYou put too many peanuts in the sack when you get you get a lot of liberals but there's not enough to pay for all your peanuts so what happened\nSo what happened was convinced rather than to go by me another hundred and ... the Mets and he said well you've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well but yeah I said well give me a chance I'll make it work\nSo I have as many peanuts in the ... I never had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so I you know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move up through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages are still around today\nYou know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if you like he's he's in the first rule of private enterprise if you identify in need and you know where the buyers are\nOld it's missing is the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learned I guess from that peanut business that is correct\nYour mom's is quoted as also saying or your mother said I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made that boy check [laughter] you you were on like the rest of the family I take it\nWell yeah well I I was a little bit more passionate about uh about the the things that I wanted to do and and uh uh that was so\nThat that's just been a part of my life I've always been passionate about the things I Do have always enjoyed the things that I Do not that there haven't been problems and issues that come up as they always do but uh uh the the\nThe ... this is that a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is\nThat he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today it's a gift we didn't earn it slap that we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is nobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what do we do with it\nAnd that's that's what's kind of driven my life\nAnd uh it's it's it's work very well for me\nI get so many people like you were saying the you know you there's a premium on youth because unfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantage is that they have now until maybe it's too late or or they wasted a lot of that but that's just typical isn't arrest\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who are who yet I'm more concerned about the things than others and and uh they're always going to be some people that will finish your hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race the big thing is is to get in the race and be a part of it\n[noise] rent you originally going to be a lawyer one happened\nWell I found out in the U.S house if finishing my second year in law school I found out that that the that profession in Nineteen fifty a really didn't pay much\nAnd uh I was I was working two or three jobs on the campus and I was doing a found out that I was making more money than than starting lawyers or at that time of the old it discouraging anyone from the\nFrom the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and uh I I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRead it isn't that one of the um a common denominator is the most successful entrepreneur is what you really alluding to hear us sense of urgency to get out and earn a living do\nYou have saluted\nThen and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point the patient you said you know I can calculate going forward on this track or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you do what'd you do rent\nI ...

journal ... now that the Trump Administration has arrived at an agreement with both Mexico and Canada on what is essentially a new North American free trade agreement tell us a little bit about what you see as the strengths and weaknesses of the new agreement\nThe biggest strength that we have a deal\nAnd there was so much chaos and uncertainty surrounding NAFTA is that how they got dealers are really good thing it's also the thing that the deal and honestly just could not ask for the most part it's not as bad as they could have banned\nAnd does that make that change as as it could have banned the positive changes that may honesty they were already included and most of them and the TPP deal\nAnd the ... ... ... feature that at Canada agreed slightly to agree to to open slightly staring at Marquette buys here for like three percent fat very much but it's the change I mean the important to know what that most export\nFrom the U.S Canada and Mexico where we're already facing hero terrorist strike and there was just accept certainly Therrien Canada or the bad side though is that the auto segment of the it's pretty bad at basically increases the cost of producing cars and particular because\nThey now have to force more from Canada Mexico and the U.S forty percent of the kind of have to be made with workers who are paid sixteen percent and\nOur said these are all prevention that increases the cost of doing business part out of maker and this is all for the purpose of paying no duty between when you're export cars victory in the U.S and Canada and Mexico\nPresident Trump of course Veronique had placed the number of terrorists on various Canadian goods did the imposition of those tariffs have the desired impact of bringing that Canadians to the table and make concessions did that actually play a strong role\nAt dinner because TPP already got these concessions from the Canadian dairy remember for the most part there were no parents between Canada\nAnd the U.S and keeps a lot of the protectionism that had that was tell and NAFTA and so it just created this chaos by trying for PBS\nAnd a lot of these features and metal in Paris and that's the thing was out of terrorists getting concessions that would have gotten on T. V. P. and by the way they met all terrorists are still so we're worse off than before\nAll started you referenced TPP a couple of times in your answers bearing the brunt listeners who may not be familiar with the term what is the BP\nGave me the way I don't see that are all trade agreement between\nA bunch of nation not not Europe and also a lot of Asian country and wise to create more free trade and and the purpose of multilateral ... everyone gets a little at a Canadian had agreed to reduce their ... they may have actually kind of\nUp a little bit more than and TPP back but also the second biggest goal of all I've asked us to actually put China back against a wall by creating the stereotype free trade zone between other Asian countries and countries and and the usa and Canada\nAnd and also to exclude China and the only way China could have actually joined way to agree to concession on I. P. protection and on a state owned enterprises a lot of things that we claim I Want to see from China\nOr the president was drawing from TPP and advance threatened if we drove from NAFTA and so here we are today\nSo we have this new NAFTA new trade agreement and there was a perception at least that the old NAFTA was unfair to the United states of course the president made this a big part of his campaign and twenty sixteen\nSo bottom line here Veronique is this an improvement on the old NAFTA\nThey're small improvement for sure I mean that's the idea that was over twenty year old\nSo it it happened before they write an e commerce and things like that that needed modernization seven of a deal semi they all died\nAnd that's a good thing I mean there are some as I said the at the site of NAFTA dairy market for Canada as it got fake also and what it does is that it increases the threshold for selling stuff through the Internet for individuals for it to be a duty free it used to be very very low and so that's that's a good thing but that\nLimitation on it and what that limitation might mean for the very a rank arrests and partisan process that we've seen play out\nDuring the confirmation hearings for judge Brett Kavanaugh who of course is president Donald Trump's pick\nTo fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court and that was left when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement earlier this year now by the time you're listening to this it's very possible that Kavanaugh may have been confirmed by the Senate it looks like we're going to get a vote within the next few days but that doesn't mean that this debate over\nTerm limits or the lack of for Supreme Court justices will go away indeed as I said it's a debate we've been having for a long time\nSo long in fact Alexander Hamilton actually tackled\nThe same question in federal is Seventy nine\nHe contrast it the lack of any limits on Supreme Court justice is ten year with rules that existed then in New York state that forbade anyone over age sixty from serving on the bench and Hamilton ultimately dismissed worries about judges becoming unable to discharge their duties because of advanced age he said this is an imaginary fear\nBut of course two centuries later there's still no limit on how how long Supreme Court justices conserve and that actually makes the Supreme Court an outlier not just among global\nDemocracies but even within the United states because almost every state has a mandatory retirement age for judges usually it's Seventy or Seventy five somewhere around there\nAnd some states also require sitting judges to face the voters that pre determined intervals for up or down retention election so\nIt it's not as if there's a full scale election for judges but there is some sort of a democratic mechanism there and many of the arguments in favor of placing limits on judges age or tenure are pretty much the same today as they weren't Hamilton de\nConcerns about the mental fortitude of elderly jurists for example or about a Supreme Court that could grow out of touch with the nation who's laws it reviews if all the judges are too old\nAnd I'm like in Hamilton's time it's hardly uncommon for judges to remain on the bench well past age sixty and indeed the average age of the eight Supreme Court justices that we have right now is is sixty seven years Ruth Bader Ginsburg for example is eighty five she's the oldest in says she wants to remain on the court until she is Ninety\nBut the acrimonious fight over a judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation has given this debate over lifetime appointments and new angle term limits have been proposed as a way to make the current system fairer that's what David Leonhardt argues in the New York times he says that it would also in part other benefits like removing aging judges from the high court and\nGiving the senator more predictable schedule for knowing when confirmation hearings are going to happen rather than they just suddenly pop up whenever a judge decides to retire or happens to die that the most well formed plan for term limits comes from fixing the court a nonpartisan group interested in making the Supreme Court more open and accountable\nThey also favorite things like TV coverage of oral arguments and making the judges file financial disclosures every year fixed the courts favors a fixed Eighteen year term for judges allowing every president to nominate a new justice in his or her first and third year of each term\nSo you'd have Eighteen your term limits and if those had been imposed in the past the current makeup of the court actually wouldn't be very different than how it is today\nRight now there are four justices on the court were nominated by democratic presidents and there are forced to be five who were nominated by Republicans if you go back in time and you implement fix the court system the current court would have a five four Republican slant for judges from the George W. Bush administration\nFor from the Obama administration one already appointed by president Donald Trump in his first year in office\nAnd you would have Trump now preparing to replace one of Bush's judges as soon as next year when that term would expire now this arrangement fix the court says\nIt would solve the problems with the court that have led to the extreme partisanship and harmful polarization that we see today and I think this appeal to civility is one that might find a receptive audience\nAfter the rancor is an awful Kavanaugh hearings but one term limits and the predictability that they provide really save us from the nastiness that we've seen on display in the last few weeks well I'm somewhat skeptical\nWhen the stakes really be that much lower if Kavanaugh were in the running for an Eighteen year term on the court with with everything else being equal in other words if the current conservative liberal split and the potential fate of the abortion law were hanging in the outcome the promise that Kavanaugh would merely sit on the bench for Eighteen years we're probably not bring Democrats down from the barricades\nAnd nor would it make Republicans any less likely to push for his confirmation\nBut even if you're just will term limits are actually a bulwark against the hyper partisan environment that's increasingly spilling over into the Supreme Court the idea might be worth considering for two other reasons for one\nPeople seem to like a recent morning consult political poll found that sixty one percent of voters favored term limits for Supreme Court justices including majorities of Democrats Republicans and independents\nAnd for a second reason it would openly acknowledge something that everyone already knows\nThat control the Supreme Court is a reward for electoral success now this goes against what the founders may have intended they wanted lifetime Supreme Court appointments to buffer the justices from political interests but it's clear now if it wasn't already that both sides Democrats and Republicans view Supreme Court appointments as the spoils that come\nFrom controlling the presidency and the Senate\nSo it was the high court is going to be politicized anyway maybe it makes sense to have those seats the democratically accountable and\nActually reflect the results of elections over the previous two decades which is what the senior term limits system would accomplish\nNow imposing term limits would require constitutional amendment that's probably an impossibly heavy lifting the current environment\nAnd there's plenty of other stumbling blocks to\nIn all likelihood nothing is going to change will continue to muddle through with the same somewhat broken process that we're using now term limits or the lack of will not fix the underlying problems plaguing all aspects of the capital confirmation process for reason magazine I'm Eric bam cut you right back here next week on another

freedom ring usa on this American radio journal commentary\nPresident Trump's domination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court was bound to be ideologically controversial because it would create a generally conservative five to four majority for what I Would argue is the first time since FDR it's not before\nI expected that their primary ideological issue with the abortion and whether he would tilt the balance of the court away from the constitutionally liberal articulation of a right to privacy that permits most abortions too are constitutionally conservative

of all accusations of sexual misconduct for instance\nThere are too many African American men convicted and jailed after having been accused of rape or attempted rape of white women where in fact the accusation was ill founded\nOne of the most well known of these is the case of high school football star Brian Banks was falsely accused convicted as serving time in prison\nWhen his accuser finally admitted to fabricating the entire clay we will probably never know what really happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two between Brett Kavanaugh and Christians lousy or at Yale a few years later\nBut we are looking at the judicial record of a lawyer and judge who's conduct has never wants to my knowledge been subject to question or a scandal in the many years that he is practice law or served on the bench\nYet his adolescent conduct may have been reprehensible and should not be dismissed lightly but it's not the students to Brett Kavanaugh of over a quarter century ago\nWho was nominated if the judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC circuit court the wanting disregard if his judicial record by those who oppose him on ideological grounds but don't have the courage or intellect to challenge him on his record shows the world that we base our ideals by our bum best\nI voted for President Trump and I support his nomination of judge Kavanaugh\nBut I cringe when I hear him mock doctor for I think judge Kavanaugh has what it takes to be a good justice of our Supreme Court but I cringe when he allows himself to make snide remarks to a senator who was the daughter of an alcoholic or when he descends into partisan comments about his accusers\nDo you listeners of American radio journal feel the same way do you feel the need for a shower after watching some of our senators\nHow do you define total objectivity if you brought Osama bin Laden\nAnd the parents of his victims and the same room\nYou can't totally transcend yourself the only one way to arrive at it

because of which we had the capacity to have all we were overwhelmed by a reality that people are looking at an intricate design\nFar greater than the design of stained glass window and that semi

keep him in my view or the apex of his creations\n... see the glory and the shame of the universe locked into your capacity in my head\nAnd so as I bring this to a close\nI Want to tell you what I think is really happening here I don't think the problem of humanity is as much to fearful mess of evil as much as the fearful and that's a good think about that\nCs Lewis in her lender talks about this gentleman who walks into the presence of the holiness and he says this I felt showed the decree chill is what the call good\nBut I wasn't sure whether I really like good news so much as I had
