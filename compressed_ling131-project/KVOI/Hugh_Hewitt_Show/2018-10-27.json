rolled it out sold off basically all of the units a bitcoin\nThey receive the cash for that that was there basically how they made their money\nTo to put the the coins out there and that that you know to nobody ... I mean I own some point I own a little bit um and and everybody who is he basically has put money in and bought bitcoin has it you know it's all recorded on the public block chain\nA ledger so it's it's owned it's very dispersed that's what's wonderful about it but he does own that unlike\nThe currency of cash and the dollar it's not ultimately owned by the federal government it's owned by the

nonetheless\nYou know the policies are going to be put in jeopardy what do you think about that\n[noise] well I think what's been lost in the debate you know we heard early on their Scooby giant blue wave and now I'm Democrats are licking their wounds because they don't think that that's going to happen they may take over the house and they lose seats in the Senate but\nTraditionally this happens every mid term election where you have a new president coming\nI'm traditionally two years into that president's term for president loses\nA number of seats a reasonably large number I Believe it's it depends on how you measure but it's about twenty seats in the house in one seat in the Senate lose the president's party that's the way it's been in that the historical trends so I think that's what people should expect so I'm\nAbout twenty CPR that they were still Republicans would have the house that was the outcome\nYeah and then it might be a maybe it's going to be a little bit more than that maybe it's not but I think that we do you're absolutely right saved up the economy is doing great and I think the American people should\nReward the party in power for\nHistoric tax cuts for the fact that\nYou know the economy is doing a lot better people have jobs with historically low unemployment rates because of the government policies that reduce regulations allowed small businesses access to

be wrong and the time you're ... going to be introduced it's a great thing and I think the American people look at that and say I'm One more tax cuts I Want less government I Love the fact that

time listeners are those who are not quite familiar with everything you do um give us a snapshot again of of ID gee I'm as it exists today and then we'll go back and check it out\nYeah well we're a company whose mission it's been the focus on providing people the most time where you go and and the actionable information about computers communications and chronic on and we do that for about three hundred and newspapers and magazines around the world um with titles like computer world peace URL Mac world affairs\nOn a A N and we do that through about three hundred or newspapers and magazines around the world the type of computer world series hero Mac world et cetera and we have a point to the Web sites that are made in support those magazine brands and ah about twelve hundred different expeditions and conferences\nThat pat is one of the greatest examples of settings first when people told them it could be done and we've heard from other guest on legends of success how many nations to work when someone had a new idea and ... just referenced if you have a new id and people telling you can't be done\nYou're probably on the right trail to success because no one's done right now\nAre you exactly right there on you know\nGoing going back one of the first year we told you couldn't go to MIT you you you want a full scholarship there while you were there a you became the editor of computers and all of the nation magazine correct that's correct yes\nAnd that really gave me a chance to uh uh get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters how\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that was a big help or because they knew my name and teen my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up of two that are paid a sense of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you've got while you're at MIT but you stayed with it when you graduated correct\nUh that's right yeah the when as an editor I was out now talking to the heads of the computer companies or you know told me that they had a need for this or um and when I have a problem with the price he said that was\nToo low I should charge more thought that'd be taken seriously I Love that business idea and uh so I put put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me checks for about twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment so that is actually all the capital that are used to get started so\nTo or anyone asked me about how to start a business I just talked to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll you know go sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with your customers they'll they'll be happy to support you well\nAbsolutely an ... you know there's there's a real important in the lesson here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years number of years ago or sixties\nYeah it was a ... there and that's about\nUh sixty three sixty three ... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information a world of computers were number this was back in the sixties you build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of where they were all located now so the lesson I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a plan new publication you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we're interested in and you you know you can do it on your own uh\nSo I said fine I'll Try it and then that with with started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers\nWell with their problem and difficulties and we launched\nThe weekly newspaper and everyone told us it couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll be either you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went all the one that was a bad market and we saved some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got through advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing in ... when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat nah you could do that we're not interested or telescopes um how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've I put in like sold my car and put in the five thousand dollars that was all my proceeds available and\nThen I went to my sister and I went to the first person either employed do ... general manager and said would you be willing to invest in support me and this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know these things they risky they don't always succeed so\nWe're going to give you ten dollars while secret to you're a cat here ... adventure your capital availability\nSo so your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bills from your wife and a manager you my sister and a manager\nYou I'm Sorry your yeah your sister manager right so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic under sixty four ... ... and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors gave you the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars a seat that eight\nOr ... unbelievable\nAbsolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nA ride which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was that easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so\nAnd they say can be done that means\nI'm going to have very much reduced competition and that just by energetically you know keeping in touch with um they had written prospects you often find ways that they would like to see the service provider that no one else is they do that and then you can charge in and you know put a give them something they really want and you know into the ethical you support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is either to success but when ... when you're growing business no matter what stages pass isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical elements that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to them and and listening to what they need some simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right that when people ask me oh what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lot of physical energy cuts that you have to put Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days you know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit\nBut don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans because\nUh [noise] uh but you said that there was work your plan but you should do with working market going out and finding out what people want their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to\nYou know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up sometime you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said then is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneurs in America the wealthiest most successful never really had any formal written business plan and if they did they usually pulled out\nA I've found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas and your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're glowing from a from a regional business you know start up you mentioned some of the critical element what about growing from regional to national what it is next critical steps to grow a business even further\nBut of course you have to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country as a people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there they they keep that has to go over and you know and and actually make discussions with the proposed customers to make sure they\nSee the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who uh shares your passion for the for the moment of those needs\nAnd you know has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know give them the resources they want a give them an encouragement and support get out of their way let them you know just to their local market and to provide them help and assistance but don't try to tell them how to do it because\nYou're never going to fully understand foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is\nGoing to be much more able to move quickly adjusted changes within that market\nOn another point you came up with an you shared with me in the past is that on the decentralization was important to you and and you you you'd um hone in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty was very key to the globe your business on your business units can you share with the number one this is so important okay\nYeah that's our average business ties and how I found early on that I Would go I was like a typical entrepreneur I wanted to control everything make sure everything was happening in a way I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control with actually slowing the growth of the business and that's why I really have the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not a my control\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not a my control but finding fertile markets then good at getting an enthusiastic leader and then I found that morale eyes I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that\nAre the morale was her pick at about a hundred and fifty people are the people at that stage they knew knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of why they're role with how important in the company and they were all you know work together as a unified team\nI ... and it's interesting because that sort of\nA you know we have people grow up in the uh families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA typically like twelve people in the family and to tell you a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of a human beings who would move around a and conduct all their activities and I think the mind is really sort\nBut there is a um you know I'm not usually increases that I think maybe it's it's partially that there's something in the pollution and the environment that is causing this to increase by partially that the\nAbility to recognize an early stage or to take a you know situation artistic development allows from our cases to be reported\nBy the autism is actually is at fault in the early

Nineteen eighty and we went around to the various companies that were in the in the computer field and they were all advertising with our magazines and newspapers and we said the we're going to do a weekly TV program\nAnd it's a terrific and we're going to buy a thirty second spot on your show and no time at all we had all the\nUh all the TV availability is filled out so we went ahead and hired

Trump administration's efforts at regulatory relief that resulted in twenty three billion dollars in cost savings\nHere to talk about the lessening regulatory burden on business is Ken Cuccinelli ten is a former Virginia attorney general now serves as director of the regulatory action center at the freedomworks foundation and welcome back to American radio journal\nCan we know that the Trump Administration has made regulatory relief a top priority can you give us an update on the progress that the administration is making in this area\nThey just put out a semi annual report and a lot of these things have been very boring in the past and frankly very burdensome that\nVery proud of their work and they have every right to be the most recent period of time they've they've saved annual savings of over a billion dollars\nWith a lifetime savings of twenty three billion dollars and\nWhen you compare that to the same period for the Obama administration during the same period they imposed two hundred and thirty five billion dollars worth of regulatory costs and that produces nowhere else it makes no one richer it makes our economy poor by that amount of money because these are just transaction closet\nBusinesses have to bear gesture exist so to reduce them as the Trump Administration has done and has made clear it's going to continue to do has really helped boost economic growth and opportunity for every American\nWhen you talked Ken about regulatory costs on business most Americans of course don't run a business although everybody has dependent upon them were income so tell me a little bit it a little bit more depth what you mean by the term regulatory cost of the business what burden does this place on businesses and how does that affect the ordinary worker\nSo she's a simple example when I left the attorney general's office of Virginia I've been doing a number of things and send one of them you might not expect with three other people that I Know we started an oyster business in the Chesapeake Bay\nNow and it's still going four years later it's going well candor island oyster company in the tenure islands in the middle of that well\nAs you know the food has certain safety risks with it and we have to when we totally oysters out of the day\nWe have to do it before ten am during the summer so there's not much sun and heat we have to have them on ice and in certain temperature ranges and their reasons for that those are health and safety regulations somebody like me very minimalist the person when it comes to government regulation\nThinks those makes sense that we had to take classes and learn them and so forth but if your business like\nA barber say you wanted to start a hair cut I'll call it a salon you have to go get it cosmetology license from your state and typically you have to\nTyler gee license from your state and typically you have to take hundreds of hours of classes and this is just to cut hair let's set aside using chemicals on coloring hair and things like that just to cut hair\nWell why on earth should you have to do any of that and what does it do what it does is it doesn't allow poor people to just boom start up their hair cut business and I'll tell you what if I go to your hair cut business and you don't cut my hair well guess what I'm not coming back\nThe market will take care of it when there aren't a health and safety burdens and issue government shouldn't be regulated it shouldn't be regulating and the federal government regulates building codes and other things that should be left the states and local governments the closer the government is to us the more response of it is to us\nAnd that that's a principle the founders talked about this isn't new\nAnd the Trump Administration is peeling away layers of federal regulation that give us more opportunities to start out small businesses\nOne of the things we saw in the Obama administration is a nosedive in entrepreneurial spirit that people America has distinguished itself in our history by our do it yourself attitude up by your bootstraps willingness to take risks and part of that is starting businesses well\nThe effort to start new businesses came to not a screeching halt under the Obama administration\nBut it drops to record lows and that has all turned around a a very common response of the business person five years ago to the burdens that government was placing on them was if I had to start my business today I wouldn't do it or I couldn't do it well\nThe attitude is changing and you see it reflected in the optimism of small business owners and their organizations that measure that optimism is the highest it's been in decades\nAnd a lot of that is not because of the just the tax bill which is what a lot of people focus on his lower taxes it's because the government is making an effort and affirmative effort to get out of the way to expand freedom and opportunity\nAnd what's at stake here is something called the separate solvers loophole in the Fifth Amendment now that sounds very complicated or legal easy\nBut it's actually pretty straight forward most people are probably pretty familiar with\nThe idea of double jeopardy the idea that you cannot be tried and convicted twice for the same crime but there is this the strange loophole that effectively allows you to be both tried and convicted at the state level and the federal level\nFor the same crime and parents Marquez gamble\nFell right into that loophole a few years ago he was convicted in two thousand eight of second degree robbery and as a condition of that conviction I he was prohibited from owning a firearm under both state and federal law\nNow in twenty Fifteen gamble was pulled over by the cops for having me busted tail light they searched his car and they found a hand gun in the car so he ended up being convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm and he was convicted both by the state of Alabama and by the federal government\nHe won't be released from prison until February of twenty twenty that is\nThree years later than if he had only been convicted at\nThe state level now gamble has appealed his federal conviction on the grounds that he was being punished twice for the same crime which of course the Fifth Amendment explicitly forbids\nUnfortunately for gamble the Supreme Court has ruled that the same behavior actually can be punished under both federal and state law without violating the ban of double jeopardy because the state and the federal government are two distinct\nSovereign but this doctrine of separate sovereign really has a bit of dubious legal history to it at first arose in an Eighteen fifty two case that had to do with fugitive slaves\nAnd then it was upheld by the court in a prohibition era K. C. U. S. V. lands and both of those rulings are kind of looked down on nowadays as having been poorly reason\nSo this case matters because there's been a push to federalize so many crimes in recent decades and that means there's now really significant overlap between state and federal offense isn't that creates more opportunities for multiple convictions based on the same actions\nThat redundancy seems to conflict with the intent behind the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment and it also makes it harder for states and the federal government to set appropriate penalties since neither really knows what the other will do or if the other will even seek out an additional conviction for the same crime\nSo a victory for gamble in this case could mean tossing out a long standing but poorly conceived\nSupreme Court precedent or at least potentially limiting its use and that would protect defendants from facing cereal prosecutions for the same crime and ultimately increase liberty and and be a significant reform to America's criminal justice system\nSo that's one case to keep your eye on I think the other important criminal justice case in front of the court this session comes out of Indiana the cases Kim's the Indiana so what's at stake here is the eighth amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and the question of whether that\nProhibition applies to the states as well as the federal government the Supreme Court will hear the case here oral arguments in the case on November twenty eighth the back story here is that titan Tamms was arrested in twenty Fifteen after selling heroin to undercover police officers\nHe's a criminal and he doesn't dispute that he pleaded guilty to one count of dealing a controlled substance in one town of conspiracy to commit theft\nAnd he was sentenced to one year of house arrest followed by five years of probation but\nHe was also required to pay investigatory fees and court costs and then on top of that the state of Indiana sees his landrover which he had purchased with money received from his late father's insurance pay out not from the proceeds of drug sales\nBut the state's took the car on the grounds that it had been used in the process of committing a crime basically but he had carry drugs in the car and so they had a right to forfeit now Tim has appealed the forfeiture of his vehicle he's not appealing his conviction he's not appealing other parts of his sentence\nHe's only appealing the forfeiture of his vehicle arguing that he was already being punished for the crime ended at seizing the truck valued at forty thousand dollars violated the eighth amendment ban on excessive fines and appeals court found that the forfeiture of the Land Rover was grossly disproportional\nBecause it amounted to a penalty that was about four times the maximum monetary fine for the crimes that teams had actually\nCommitted in was already being punished for\nThe Indiana Supreme Court however overturned that decision on the ground that the ban on excessive fines only applies at the federal level and not to the states to the legal background here is really interesting and important the Supreme Court has long track record of ruling on on multiple occasions\nThat the various limitations on government power included in the bill of rights apply to the states as well as the federal government and that happens\nBecause of the fourteenth amendment due process clause so in Nineteen sixty two for example the Supreme Court ruled that the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment applies to the states and in twenty Fifteen it reached the exact same conclusion about the eighth amendment ban on excessive bail\nBut the court has never explicitly said that the amendment's prohibition on excessive fines and fees also applies to the state and so the Supreme Court seems to have taken this case\nBecause it gives them an opportunity to do exactly that to clear up the yes indeed the Constitution's ban on excessive fines does apply to the states and this would have important ramifications for civil asset forfeiture proceedings\nA decision applying the excessive fines close to the state level would make it far easier to challenge unreasonable fines and fees including noxious forfeiture but also cases were local governments have hit homeowners with massive civil penalties for offenses like unapproved paint jobs or having Halloween decorations up for too long\nThe fact that some local governments use those fines and fees as a means to raise revenue was created a perverse incentive to target residents unfairly or to go after people who are just minding their own business so a victory for teams in this case would be an important step\nTowards curbing that sort of local and state government abuse and it would also be a significant blow to other problems created by civil asset forfeiture\nSo these are two big cases gambling Tim's they're not cases they're necessarily going to capture\nThe news media attention they're not going to be all over the front page of the New York times the oral arguments here that take place November twenty eighth and December fitter worth paying attention to and the ruling when they come out early next year\nCould have important ramifications for the criminal justice system and I think more importantly for the rights of Americans the rights that are already and try and in the constitution but are not necessarily always present in the the actual practice of the criminal justice system\nOperates a magazine I married name will be right back to your next week on another edition of American radio journal\nThe sprint T Mobile merger is now before the Federal Communications commission triggering a debate over competitiveness calling Hannah of freedom or in usa has an American radio journal commentary as a conservative\nI'm a fervent believer in the free market and the economic value of competition and that's usually oppose mergers because they tend to reduce competition competition fixed prices low and us benefits consumers there was a proposed merger that is now seeking government approval that is different however it's the proposed\nMerger between wireless carriers sprint and T Mobile has a long time sprint mobile customer I have more than just a passing or theoretical interest in this one and I've concluded that it's one of those rare mergers that is likely to preserve rather than reduce competition here's why\nThe mobile or wireless industry is complex but there are essentially two types of players one is what they call mobile network operators or MSN those those are the companies that own and operate cell phone towers had their networks there are four of them were rising AT and T. sprint\nThere were four of them were rising AT and T. sprint and T Mobile the other players like consumer cellular cricket metro PCS than US Cellular or what's called mobile virtual network operators are M. V. in those\nThere are dozens of them and they did an owner operate their own cellular networks they basically piggy back on the for him and those buying access at wholesale rates the envy and those are fierce competitors and they're innovative rape plans and discounts hold down rates for every one\nOf the big for him and those were rising and AT and T. or roughly the same size and each has roughly twice the size of sprint and T Mobile\nMobile industry is on the cusp of the next big technology and mobile communications called five gee\nThe five gee mobile technology will carry more than twenty times the data loaded the card for G. technology this means faster download times for bandwidth hungry applications like HD video and it's even more than twenty times faster for a certain other types of data\nFive ... technology will be very expensive to implement however\nIt will cost literally billions upon billions of dollars and that's where this merger make sense\nOf arise in an ATM T both have capital and access to capital in the order of magnitude required to roll out five gee sprint and T Mobile or capital constrained by comparison because of this it will take them longer to update their networks and in the meantime they will be operating at a competitive disadvantage\nIn a marketplace that values the latest technology and we're customer loyalty is at best a secondary consideration the result in likelihood is that for rising and they TNT\nWould pick off millions of technology obsessed customers from sprinting T Mobile further enlarging the too big players and tricking the two smaller embryos\nIt wouldn't be long before they're easy pickings for mergers with the big two\nLeading to only to long term him into survivors but if the two smaller him in those proposed merger is approved there would be three surviving him into sort of comparable size so the question before the FCC and the department of justice is not whether it is in the public interest to go from for him in those two or three\nBut whether it is better in the long run to have three ... than two\nThree and Mentos will also compete more vigorously for the business of dozens of them via knows if there are only two and Mentos and there's a good chance that they'll ease into a kind of ... of two players\nWho don't really compete head to head but rather decided to carve up the envy in a
