needed\nWell I I don't I so I don't I don't want to necessarily associate myself with with your characterization wants to be with you\nI keep in mind the one thing which is that if people see the

certain number of people in the middle\nThe moderate independents truly ... that people just call them do that but the true independents will they see a mob rushing through the capital or will they the victims of the women who are\nWho want it to be heard and will their anger at the Democrat you know you know be the kind of visceral anger that you have that motivate them to vote against

I agree last last question what do you make them better and the Trump\nKim Jong or the election\nI think you're probably right I I don't have any reporting necessarily to say that it's for sure but I think you know might that\nWould be that he would probably want to do that I don't know uh I assume it probably is a plus politically for the president but talk about a wild card you just do a you

Arizona Daily Star column about don't eat veal but uh we're going to do I've got to do have to learn to half ground beef how grim pork and I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna do it up tonight\nI'm going to do for for Columbus that yes certainly\nSpeak above chains are we really enjoy a Reagan was a good pizza or good stuff a lot big portions and stuff like that and and friendly atmosphere a good time there a couple of times lately is good good yeah\nThank you for having local businesses in the back now I'm just ... river chains are also most chains are owned by local people somewhere\nYou know what I mean but it's also the idea that you know what are you doing you know it it in in your chain right so let's again I always go back to in and out burger right so here's a pretty big chain keeps growing\nThey have probably some of the best customer service and sea of any restaurant in America that I mean I get better customer service\nGetting my in and out burger than I Do at restaurants that are charging me Eighteen dollars a plate how's that pre scary so they're paying those kids twelve bucks an hour\nRight they've been you know starting a twelve moving on from there\nThey all have white clean uniforms I'm sure that's probably racist\nOkay and they're all they know how to anticipate they got good energy and they're well trained\nSo if you're a young person and it was a teenager in high school that is a place you would want to work because the habits that you learn working at a place like in and out burger will serve you the rest of your days\nSo I'm\nListener and friend of the show in my personal friend Lawrence\nHe was on the television this weekend manly Lawrence was part of a roundtable\nNot roundtable pizza round table with Lorraine better on Arizona three sixty on Arizona Public media [noise] so it was him and for other students of students to be teachers and literally this was called their red for ed revisited\nShow okay so they had these that they had these five different teachers according to them\nThey're combine experience total nearly a hundred years of teaching them okay it might not have been there a while so they had another one from a charter school coming from a you know different kinds of school Lawrence of the ... the teacher and\nYou can tell\nThere's a couple of things here when I watched I watched a Saturday morning before soccer started as what happens you wake up at four o'clock every morning right and and but I wanted to watch Lawrence and he did a great job because Lawrence\nWas the guy who's got he's got he's got his finger on reality a little more 'cause he understands that the school board screwing you more before the state he got that and I was so happy that Arizona Public media didn't edit him twice say we need to concentrate\nOn the local school boards just as much or more than the state legislature so I'm so glad he got both of those points out I knew he said you know I mean Lawrence is a very smart realistic human being but\nThe idea that they let him come through and didn't get edited out really happy about that\nUm the other thing is I I did a senior science teacher a math teacher he does a math and science they're both okay that's okay so what Lawrence's Lawrence is very valuable in this world locally because he has a bilingual math science teacher wow\nAnd that is a very valuable to a ... tool box to having the teaching business so the other thing that I I I I did you do gain a little sympathy so Lorraine talked about\nUm some people banging on teachers would be quote you get summers off right and a good answer back and Lawrence will will vouch for this\nYou are sometimes the only parental figuring this kid's life because I'm not even talking about the classic you know the liberal Democrat tells you the single mom and that's out there but we're talking about kids with two parents who just don't give a crap\nAbout their kid we have two parent families that send kids to school because it's getting them out of their hair I've always told you I hate it when I hear in August when the kids go back to school\nI hate parents who say oh I Can't with the kids are out of my hair\n\nWhy when we were done with him for nine months that's not the attitude I Love when kids I Love going to school personally alright I Love the first day of school I liked the anticipation you know the whole thing right\nBut I Love my kids so I'm just telling you this the idea that your attitude is Oh thank God the kids are out of my hair\nAnd so this is all valley right oh have you liberals and down and she said oh you mean the privilege to ... you know two parent families it's ... it doesn't matter if it's low income middle income or our high income there are parents who see school as get my kids out of my hair\nSo those teachers especially in those younger years right\nSo those teachers especially in those younger years right\nSometimes these parents or the ... of these teachers are the only parental figure that does like tries to hold them to task on things\nI saw when I coach soccer\nAnd coach ... a little league baseball sometimes I was the only guy and this kid's life who expected him to do reasonable things by a certain time period or pay attention or these kind of things so that was the part sympathetically with some of these teachers that hit me is not only are there their\nTeacher they're kinda like this kid's third parents for a lot of these kids not all these kids but a lot of\nAnd yes as you get lower income demographic neighborhoods they're going to become more of a parent figure that third parents figure in a lot of these kids' lives\nMhm okay and you don't have that much help from your ... the parents so and the kid does act out you're still cat on your\nOwn\nLawrence has told me about parents who don't even show up to their you ... you try to sell their parent teacher conference\nSo even shop\nRight and at the end the kid gets a D and they go with what what the hell's my kid getting a ... well you kind of missed three you're invited the three parent teacher conferences that there was no parent that could have told you what was happening at a time yeah you know so I gave that ... that reinforced that sympathy for some of these teachers on things that are outside of their really their job description\nAnd it's not even discipline is it's like just being a positive influence like say go right on with crime and a boy and a girl once in a while you can do this or let's give this a try let's see what happens correct you know they need that\nNow the other part is that I on the other side is the teachers the idea that Lawrence is the only guy who understands that school boards of the one that he he said that he said that in the interview was these are the people that actually cut our checks\nIs school boards so the ignorance of teachers in relation to where their money really comes from is astounding and that sounds so we are right ignorant teachers but they are ignorant I see it all the time because what's happened is\nOr if you're really into the uh Tucson Education Association and Jason freedom to use these these ... over there tell you oh if they told you to stick your head in the barbecue you might\n\nBecause I'm telling you the idea that they said skip skip the school board and go right to the state you know after both I I'm okay with having a discussion about both but if the idea that you think your school board is somehow innocent and you're getting screwed out of your money you're ignorant\nHow many times has adult leader girl ... and the folks that to you as the Scrooge on some of your money where the state legislature did respond or we had a proposition that pass that either raise the tax or whatever that was supposed to go to teachers and they didn't get all of it\nWas a thrill one was supposed to be for teachers um it was like incentive money or whatever and what happened was they didn't pay it all out under he should not be name and maybe under ... and then those teachers retired so they get screwed out of the money even if they want to get they couldn't get because they're not a teacher anymore\nThat eat well\nI mean even the money that you guys did the red red with a twenty percent right was supposed to go to teachers right well to you as he didn't give it to teachers all all of it the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "08"}
