very good person I Know we're and she's a wonderful anchor but she's screwed up last week and she went on the Late Show with Stephen Kobe or last night to talk about it cut number two\nYou gotten a little trouble with the Twitter people recently because you use and wonder if your guests are called democratic protesters mob mob and you said we're not going to use the N word around here that you got a lot of\nFlak for that what ... what happened so uh we had not really time hill I Love having on either from the Daily Beast and he brought out the word mom and and at the time the mob mob had banned the talking points from the public and from all\nOf it on Capitol Hill in the wake of what had happened with with Dr Ford in ...\nWord again I I call and I call them out in less than like I don't want to be the word police and that was not my intention but I also believe in calling out talking points and to hear him bring that up I had just had to say something\nAnd honestly at the end of my day like I'm sure you're checking Twitter too and if I ever left and the right then I got my job\nNow Eric ... the alpha talking point is if I ever the left in the right I've done my\nJob that is like the architect I can say about how many times\nHave I said that how many times have others said that and you know what that's why\nYou know what cliches are usually true and talking points are often true and the mob talking point what is more true\nThan the fact is that the left has descended into mobs threatening violence that is so pathetic and so on American if we don't call that out shame on us that is not the American way in fact it is the antithesis of everything we've always stood for\nAnd you know what they're going to Stephen Colbert later\nThis book I'm not kidding my book Donald drain the swamp I Want it to topple his nasty sour anti Trump fake children's book who's voted this vote or whatever the reason I wrote this book Hugh ... is that the last\n... is always putting out things into the culture right here's here's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty no kid would would look at it it is for adults to make fun of the president and to feel morally superior\nI wrote my book because I thought we don't have things like that\nOn the right for conservatives who want to celebrate what America is who believe Ronald Reagan was a great man I think that we need stuff like that and I I get\nVery upset because you just got a tweet from Jamie ... who is a you know kind of a never Trump or he was just on the show earlier and I thought you were coming up to talk about your book Donald brings Islam and Jamie kind of start down well that seems like a very special children's book for your three year old who is fed up with the permanent political class\nI just said the Jamie you and I am on your podcast Jamie because I think you would mix up because you know that other children's books have been used this way\nOh look this is always the case and might you know that I'm even though I'm political I'm not as political as as you and some others I'm mostly a cultural guy I'm In the culture like Steven cold there but conservatives\nDon't we don't really have a voice in the culture right\nStephen Colbert has a talk show tons of people like that have talk shows we don't have anybody effectively speaking who have talk shows like that I wrote this children's book because I think our side needs something that says this is our narrative this is what we think is happening we think he's a folk hero you want to call him a caveman\nGo ahead what he's our caveman and we're actually proud of some of this stuff he's getting done and why don't we why don't we talk about it I mean even though there's not going to have me on the show to talk about it\nBut I got to tell you this is the kind of thing this is the reason I wrote the book Donald brings the swamp is meant to be a cultural\nObject we have to get our side of the story out there and this is one of the ways we do it as much as I Love talk radio you and I have to own radio shows but there are other ways to get things out there and the fact that down at that Steven called bears\nFake children's book which is mean spirited is number one on Amazon I said this morning I have to bring that up on your show our side needs to understand we're losing that

Harry is former Pima County employee former imagine greater Tucson director\nMike homes and we talked about Mike in the past because as he was running for office in this\nSure and working for the county he basically on county time doing social media stuff to promote his election but nobody cared over there 'cause he's a Democrat running to get rid of evil Republicans good\nThen I guess Harry rams bottom I mean Mike homes goes over to work for you he was in charge a project manager on trying because they wanted to kind of get colossal cave back on its feet and they put an R. S. V. uh alright\nAn R. E. F. U. R. P. out their request for proposal for a company to manage it and then I think he went over to work for those guys after so he left the county I think to go work for those guys I don't know if he works there anymore but for some reason Mike Holmes former Pima County employee maybe they're going to have bring them back\nA imagine greater Tucson guy changes is online name to Harry rams bottom possibly because his private employer probably wouldn't appreciate you spend so much more time\nOn Facebook but who knows so when you see Harry rams bottom on those that to Harry for some reason he changed his his social media ... which I thought was bizarre now cute but foster\nBud foster former anchor with the great a guy actually and\nUm\nHe comes on because someone so uh he gets chided by someone else named Vicky about him getting on the case and this is the best one\n... ... this is his response to this lady Vicki Doug is allowed to say whatever he wants to send his right to do that it's my right no actually my duty\nAs a journalism journalists to question him on it by the way I thought it was a bit humorous\nSo now button foster has told you he is now declaring that the world that his duty as a journalist is the only question Doug Martin\n\nNow but by the widest as funny as it is a guy who basically seemingly regurgitate Pima County a ministry of defense of propaganda crap\nThe idea that now you're going to make a stand on a Doug Martin Facebook post that you're now quote a journalist\nIt's pretty funny and pathetic but do you need to retire buddy you're not doing your you are not doing this community any service anymore\nThe ...
