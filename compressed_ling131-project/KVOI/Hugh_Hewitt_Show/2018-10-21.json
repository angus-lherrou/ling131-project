that general Pershing down or they get they\nPut military in this new thing go National Guard a and I asked the the\n... a political nonpartisan congressional Research Service\nFor report on that and they said we can't say for sure but in essence a probably Seventy five thousand that US military National Guard were put on our border\nI could have been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and

be subjected to sex trafficking human trafficking uh it's it's the best thing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump is\nGoing to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I wouldn't I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get say they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if you're giving you can't just enter legally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that to word it before these people got their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past ah with Obama or they would let people like that come through\nKnowing that when they ... they say you got through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it\nIn the United states but they knew the law that if they

in the United states 'cause you could just stated let you go with the person the CIA no I was\nReally I have to tell you I just thought to this point I just saw a video that is just a that as being like little video clips that are being released a bit by bit and there was a standoff at the on the Guatemalan side right at the Mexican gate and apparently\nThe caravan is on video breaking through all of the ah security forces that Guatemala had right there in front of that a bridge and they broke through the fence and they got into Mexico\nI had not seen that a lot seeing the bullets are claiming is all they need to stop right there Mexico and claim it ends and then let's see what ... does for them but if they have them on\nThe ILO President Trump and he is serious about cutting all financial aid and that if we have to close the southern border that that would drive Mexico crazy but we got\nTo start asserting our sovereignty of the United states before our enemies a dyke advantage of what Obama did just overwhelm us we can't keep doing that\nYeah yeah and I'm I'm looking at the video starting to make its way around on social media as well because the previous video I saw was just people sort of being deterred from doing that some of the security for us but\nNow they put a nurse and they're all eyes yet for all that I hear\nOf um of uh it\nIt being all women and children 'cause that's what you hear from a lot of advocates for entity they say oh it's only women and children while I'm I've in all the pictures that I've seen a lot of men in their\n...\nAnd and that's also true that when we were being told it's just women and children well it turns out to there were more men as they were ... this was claiming ... showed us you know only yeah women and children fleeting well\nOr a man and they were sold your age and we had no business bringing them clear to the United states when with regard to refugees from the middle east uh as President Trump has a\nWe could we could help ... refugees if we left them there and just set some money to help them for every one that can United States so no matter even if you're just cold and callous\nWhich were

obviously in interesting times or ... you know they took some really big name some household names\nBut we cannot sizing up those household names were made\nAs members of bass master and members of the elite series and you can kinda understand you know why they want to try and do something that's different that is a maybe more controlled by the anglers or if you will find is reminiscent of the pie a if you remember that ten years ago the Anglos wanted to have a little bit more control and\nAnd uh and do that but they're not resolve that\nOn the elite theories is ... and you know vast vast or responded some would say that maybe it would have been all avoided it passed a strict on this maybe a year ago or so but in any event a bass bass or didn't respond and they responded with adjustment to the elite series court corny Nineteen better absolutely stunning\nWhere you know guys that are committed now and have committed to delete series for twenty Nineteen that worldly dealers are in twenty eight came a fishing for gas money John I mean it's amazing you know the kind of money that's up to them\nFor basically no entry fee\nAnd I want to talk more about that I understand that pretty much everybody in the elite series now is going to get a paycheck is that correct\nYeah um they will pay one through eighty that model was based on a beach pass by the way let me just say this applies I doubt very seriously there'll be eighty and the elite series this year I think they'll be somewhere between sixty five and Seventy and the reason is\nThat the guys that are ... you know there have contracts that are three or two or three year contract so you know with the with the lead serious\nAnd you you need to leave a little bit of room\nSo that next year is a vast ... pastor open series we'll still have an outer space to qualify guys into the elites for twenty twenty saltier silver filled with eighty\nYou know and everybody was locked in for a minimum of two years here is open series guys would be out there fishing for no opportunity to get to the elite so I Believe that a little bit of a of room there but\nBut basically what aspects of it as they put in two million dollars a fresh money\nThey're going to pay every single spot a diet right down to Alaska Christ basically on the list which means you're going to be a minimum\nOf twenty three thousand five hundred dollars and you're in the house for these guys and then on top of that the twenty thousand dollar or early ... century bonus first fifty elite that that committed to stay\nThat got it down to a negative five hundred dollars and then when you look at the money that was that in by bass master right now for twenty Nineteen year or the average payout per elite angler it's Ninety seven thousand five hundred dollars against zero\nIn you know fresh money left out of pocket layout as opposed to last year when it was Seventy five thousand dollars in a forty five thousand dollar atrophy so I mean the scar fifty thousand dollar raise its really stunning it maybe should have been done earlier but you know this is the impact this is why it's really all professional fishermen whatever\nWow I you know as you're running through these numbers the only thing I can think of is a I Wish I was a better fisherman because be I think I read the wrong profession Tom [laughter]\nYeah I mean these these guys are sticks I fish the uh the ... the basketball shot or eastern Oakland's enough\nAt this year was my first year out there with the guys that man are they good I may not fish but some young crows and that's the key here John is that there are so many guys that can catch 'em we just don't know Sam George and Curt Mitchell in these other guys as well as\nThe guys that have been out there for years and and had made their name so you know my friend marks on and put it\nCould it really is the same thing I'm Alive last month ah he he said look this is Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers left the NFL\nAre they still have a Super Bowl and that's exactly you know what's going on here is that coming up a fifth year a vast vast there is a fiftieth class to come up to twenty twenty there's gonna be a classic and there's going to be a whole wave of a new guys that are going to make a big name for themselves through all of this exposure\nThat are passed presser will provide that for a I I learned this week this was a stunning number I learned this week that there's three hundred and fifty thousand\nNew a unique views of bass master life during a vast I ... I didn't realize it was that\nHe either or and fifty thousand people watching best best alive that's a lot of views a lot of impressions for her spots\nWow you know one of the thing I Want to talk about you know these elite pros it's not like they just walk out on the stage in they've never done this before it takes years to get there\nAnd bass master basically has been used to do this you mentioned one of them is the open but bass nation I've always thought this was kind of like the the blue collar anyone can participate level of tournament fishing and ... things to candidate\nNo absolutely with the with the bath nation championship coming up in a November ... quick you know they'll they'll qualify guys that go through to ... and then also guys that do qualify gotta go to the vast vast their classic and yeah there's a structure in place you know that's the one thing about the elites or you you don't get on the elite tour because\nYour buddies or somebody or you know somebody or you got a good sponsorship deal or or whatever I mean you know ... ... ... ... or in your way out to that deal and so whether it's coming out of the college series\nLike ... did and so many others have or whether it's common\nYou know through a up through the ranks of the fascination and then he opens in qualifying for the elite series that way you know it's it's not it's not an invitation all the ... it's a ... and uh so you've got to earn your way onto this thing and and that's why I said these guy amazing the\nVast vast you heard of a hundred and fifty guys they're qualified fishermen ... tomorrow or there's that much interested in wanting to be at it but you know they they're they're trying to do the right thing they're trying to take the ... the steps to do the right thing\nAnd a and a lot of the guys that upstate I mean the other John crews are of course from missile base the cruise missile and so\nAh he's looking forward to claim that can keep the combs while I was on bass ... with me last week he fired up about the upcoming year and and and there's so many other guys that you know they're looking for it to doing the right job group Benson who want access fast or will be back with the elite and there's just so many guys and and we're just going to learn about all the way the stars\nTell you what there's a lot to digest your wish we had more time one last question you know get\nThe answer on this do you think that with the advent of major league fishing and their new bass pro tour is this going to be helpful or hurtful to the sport a tournament bass fishing\nYou know I think it's helpful I mean anytime there's more opportunities I think it's helpful I don't know that five years from now to look like it looks right now there might be a little bit of a boiling down process but ultimately this'll be helpful because you know the price of poker up\nWell there you go folks if you want to hear more about the bass tournament trail you

northwest where cougars or getting pretty darn aggressive\nAs you may recall an adult female hiker was killed by a cougar and Oregon's cascade mountains in late August\nAnd earlier this year to mountain bikers were attacked and one of them killed by attacking cougar on a trail near north band Amir half hour's drive from Seattle now we share a tale courtesy of cagey W out of Portland regarding a hunter who had a close encounter with aggressive cougars near Mount Hood in Oregon\nBuild island sold cagey W he was deer hunting near badger lake when he saw three cougars in\nHis words they jumped on the log probably a hundred and twenty feet from me and the minute they got in that log the immediately turned to me and in their ears back pulled their teeth out and started growling at me now instead of the cougars were advancing on him and didn't seem to be scared finally nine island who had a cougar tag\nFigured I'm going to have to take one of these out of the game he ended up shooting one of the advancing mountain lions which by this time was only fifty to sixty feet away nine island shot killed the female adult cougar and the other cougars left the scene\nLike Kansas Missouri in Nebraska nesting success was good and\nQuil camps are stable or slightly up meanwhile in states like Arizona some species like gambles and scaled quail\nWere hurt by dry conditions even as late monsoon rains\n... the ... a late boost\nIn the southeast though excellent hatches in places like Georgia combined with the hard work of quail forever chapters\nCreating habits yet on the ground is fueling anticipation for a very good season one a few more nuggets from this gold mine of a forecast in southwest Idaho coil numbers are up from last year and the production of young birds was excellent which is the opposite of what occurred\nFurther east in the magic valley of Idaho though you can still expect to find good hunting along the Snake River and its tributaries west of twin falls and as far north as just show any in Tennessee Quil forever biologist Andy Edwards has been hearing folks tell him they'd\nBeen seen more quail this year than they seen in recent years and that is a good sign\nEdwards says in the last five years they have helped create Ninety thousand acres of habitat in western in middle Tennessee and there are plenty of public lands available to hunt quail which can be found just about everywhere in the volunteer state except for the extreme eastern counties finally in California\nYou got options for a variety of different species of quail overall hunters should expect to find good numbers of quail in their favorite hunting areas throughout the state\nAnd who have the energy\nTo deal with it I'm a grandfather nine times over\nAnd they're the finest in the world only the pastor of this church has grandchildren that come anywhere near the quality of my [noise]\nAnd as we look at our grandchildren and play with them I Am a terminally grateful that\nThere for young people ...\nAnd so here's a couple\nRaising this child by the name\nThat he was given your seat and I was back then and in some countries today I Will tell you about\nThe recycled names from within a family so that the names stay within the family in a sense and so for this change all the sale name him John was right there breaking basic family principles caused there was not the job\nIn their family\nNow I go to India every year and their methods of naming or speaking a name is a bit different from ours\nI have a friend named K. P. Johan and and you listen and you think okay now and the way we do it that means caves ... all of his first name pi is the initial of his middle name and you'll Hammond is the family name and that's not true my name for instance if I were born in India would be eat cake Gayle\nWith my last name actually being my first or given name he being Fort Irwin\nAnd K standing for cannot who was my father and so with that system they're constantly keeping names rolling around within the family you say so far the angel that come along and say you'll naming\nJohn ... why would they do this break\nTo our principles\nAnd so it was middle aged abroad everyone was amazed and they talk about that [noise]\nWell that wasn't exactly a good an auspicious beginning for a family theology so let's go to his actual birth mother well now we should get some good theology\n\nMatch just loops way of quoting what he is saying right here you got to love me more than any thing also so much so that all other relationships on this earth one to\nJust about view them as hate in comparison\nOh man\nThat just makes them want to say why don't we just go on home\nBecause this is really a rugged statement\nIn fact Jesus in March after six he goes home and he's saying on doing all of these great things and everyone says\nGee\nAren't you want to stop your toe out there and cried I remember that [laughter]\nKnow all\nOf his anyway people don't come from this village and know anything you know that\n\nAnd then Jesus makes one of the most interesting statements which you probably had opportunity and your life to verify\nProfits not without honor except in his own\nAnd his own town in his own country isn't\nThat interesting we would think oh who your family would be the first one to say hey we like what happened to you can we be part of it\nAnd they have you remember when you first became a Christian\nAnd you wanted to go back and tell maybe your mother and your father\nAbout this and they were already religious do you remember\nCome on you did something with your head [noise]\nAnd you probably thought well and you probably say this I've heard it from a lot of people well you know I really wasn't too wise back then I just had I I don't know I got so excited that I just went back and told him they were going to hell you know what can I say [noise]\nThey didn't seem to like get a whole lot\nI thought I was crazy and maybe I was back there but I'm just so excited about living for Jesus and discovering am that I couldn't stand the thought that that might not going to make it so I went back I told them you know ...\nAnd suddenly you discover that there's not as teach they're necessarily but there is a show on\nI've even had\nPeople who came to know the lord here young men say to me\nWhen I became a follower of Jesus I didn't need the drugs anymore\nAnd my parents became very upset\nBecause they didn't understand this Jesus stuff\nThey wanted me to go back on drugs they say we understand you there but we don't understand it just\nIsn't that amazing I imagine that's happened to some of you and maybe some of you who told me this are sitting here in front of me\nSo you see [laughter] it just is not an easy thing and the fact is becoming a true follower\nOf Jesus often will as you know put you at odds with your\nFamily [noise]\nAll right yeah yeah well\nThen I saw it and I think it's time for us to set a little bit of this city are you ready ... been tense enough so far\nAre you thinking boy you'll never have a radio program with that and that's [noise]\nBut then I discovered that well yes indeed God invented the family but he also added to reinvent it because you see what happened was we ... we did not follow on as family followers of God but Senate or the picture\nAnd he was not able to say of Adam this is my son nor critics say that us\nUntil something happen for us to be born a\nInto another family\n[noise] go with me to march after three there and\nMark three is a fascinating statement and because it happens early in the chapter and its combination doesn't come until the end one\nCan Passover rather easily in March after three genes just had such crowds gathering around him all the time that he just didn't even have time to eat sometimes if it was like something was funny happening over there nobody can quite understand it\nSo embarrassed one eight and a multitude came together again so that they could not so much as he bread but when his own\nHeard about this his own family heard about this\nThey went out to lay a hold of him to go rescue him to go bringing home for they said here this\nDownturn\nThe south\nNow put yourself back in marriage huge by now it seems that Joseph is no longer on the scene we don't know why we really don't know the assumption is that perhaps he he died\nAnd now here is Mary walking with leaving\nBrothers of Jesus getting you capture there's a basic set that doesn't believe that he is the messiah I'm confident that Mary believe that and held it in our heart and probably said that the other folks\nEventually you will find not come on you know I don't\nBelieve all mom he's our [noise]\nSo now put yourself in the shoes of his family immediate family brothers and the news comes\nJesus that's gone crazy he's mine over there\nI can hear him saying ha ha I knew it I knew it and now\nThey can marry or walking to where Jesus as I can hear them saying now I Hope you will get off of our case with this messiah but now that there's more it's gone crazy and we have to go and help rescue them and bring him home and you can nursing back to his must science yeah\nCan you hear\nIt but it gets worse I Wish it didn't but it does verse thirty one then his brothers and his mother came\nAnd standing outside they sent him calling him\nAnd a multitude was sitting around him and they said to him your mother and your brothers are outside\nSee getting you know put yourself back in the shoes of\nThinking you know put yourself back in the shoes of Mary you're outside and you have just sent word and hey what would you tell Jesus that we want to see him that folks I don't want to get on any cases but when I read this it just gives me pause about praying through Mary [noise]\nEver stop and think about this [noise]\nAnd from the inside of the circle you hear and Jesus say when you say that word in there and tell him his mother and his brothers are out of here and would like to talk to them\nAnd he answered saying as my mother [noise]\nWas my brother\nThat's suppose you're married y\nCommendable I'll show you who your mind [noise]\nI changed her diapers don't you do this [noise]\nBut here is where the beautiful beautiful beautiful discovery comes because here we discovered Jesus reinventing\nThe family listen to this\nHe looked around in a circle that those who sat about him and said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of God is my brother and my sister and my\n\nThanks for joining us today if you enjoy this portion of teaching you may want to catch the rest of the message just call those toll free one eight eight eight three

talking about if you got that equipment you need to tune it in\nYou got the equipment I've already given you the ability to hear me but you need to tune in to me and Jesus told a story about how to tune in\nIt's called the parable of the solar and the terrible before soils it's in little chapter eight if you brought your Bible you can turn if you don't it's All right all the verses are there on the outline let me read you the story\nWhile a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town\nHe told the story\nA farmer went out to sew a seat\nAnd how's he was scattering the seeds some felt along the foot path\nAnd it was trampled on the birds the air ended up\nAnd some fell on rocky soil where when it came up the plants with it because they had no moisture\nAnd some other Seif el among weaves which grew up with it and show the plant\nAnd still others the fell on good soil and it came up and you'll do the crop a hundred times more than it was shown winning and said this he called out and said\nHe's who has ears to here let him hear\nNow what's he talking about what Jesus Says this farmer goes up so seat\nAnd he's not planning one seat of the time he's doing this thing he's broadcasting he's just tossing seed out over the ground\nAnd he says it falls on different types of soil and the pending the type of soil it falls on it gets a different response\nNow fortunately later in the same chapter Jesus explains a story tells us the meaning of all the parts and he says is\nThe farmer represents God\nAnd the sea represents God wanting to talk to you God's word you\nAnd the soil represents for different attitudes that you can have toward hearing from God for different responses for different heart responses or mind responses and we're going to look at those today because before we can go into how they hear\nGod you've got to hear how to prepare your heart prepare your mind you're got speak\nFor we do that Tom gonna come and talk about why it's important to hear from God\nSenior outlined or three reasons why it's important to hear that voice number one it proves that I'm In God's family and verify that shows that you're a you're a believer it confirms that you have a relationship with cry that he that he talks to\nI don't know if you know this but Tom Cruise and I are are good friends I never I never told you that before but I actually I write him all the time off and now she's never actually written me back but I Do write him all the time [noise]\nIf I write Tom Cruise all the time I ever write pay back or we're friends now I'm a fan that's all and if I talk to God I should hear back from it and that's what it means to have a\nRelationship with him if you you cannot have a relationship without communication and if you never hear from God you have a reason to question whether you have a relationship with God\nOr to question whether you're listening to him at all if you do have a relationship with him like what the Bible has to say\nBut Jesus had to say about us hearing God over in John ten twenty seven Jesus said my she recognized my voice\nAnd they follow me there was a there's a myth out there the God only speaks to the best of his children like if you're a Moses or somebody like that God might have something to say but the truth as you as parents you just speak to some your kids or you speak to all your kids\nYou may want to just speak to send your kid but I'm asking do you speak to all your kids of course should do that is just the way that it is when a when we talk about God Speaking to us one of the truth is he not only speak to us during the good times have you noticed with your kids when they're struggling to speak even more to him sometimes when they're struggling and when we're struggling got have they been more to say to us\nAnd when I talk to my kids they recognize my boy\nIf I if I call my son Ryan ... out in Chicago college I don't have to call and say hello right and this is\nTom holiday your father [noise]\nOh I have to do is say Hi and he recognizes might watch that one always always that way had babies children don't recognize your voice as a baby they can hear my voice and look at me with adoring eyes but those are either have babies they'll they'll look at a stranger in the store with the same adoring I still\nLook at their strength carrots with the same adoring I but as you grow you learn to recognize your father's boy\nOne of the reasons we want you to grow spiritually isn't that you can begin to\nRecognize to sort out God's voice from all the other voices that are out there now it is a lifetime project we're going to be learning to recognize his voice the rest of our life if I Want to tell you it does get easier the better you get to know Christ the better you begin to recognize and thrown out God voice from all the other things that you're hearing out there\nIt's proof that I'm In God's family that is one of the reasons that you and I have to recognize as important here from God a second reason is it protecting me from mistakes\nIf you will lessen Goggle warn you an advance of of traps in life God will do he'll keep his promise improper chapter three or six would you read it with me listen for God voice and everything you do and everywhere you go he's\nThe one who will keep you on track\nI got to tell you I Can't count the number of times\nWhen somewhere in the morning I'm trying to listen to a guy and he says watch out for this today through a Bible verse I'm reading or thought that comes into my mind watch out for this today and somewhere in that day that protects me from making the stupidest mistake God will do that for you if you listen to him how many people would like to be protected from making stupid mistakes\nI mean that's just a common thing in life and God has the power to do that if we will only\nListen to him sometimes God protects us from mistakes by saying a single word\nDon't just that one so syllable sometime guy gets it from the right direction keeps us on track as the first thing as saying by using\nFree syllable go for you and I when we listen to God he keeps us on track\nAnd then the third reason why it's important here from God and that is it produces personal success\nThe Bible says and I'm thirty two verse say I will guide you along the best pathway for your life I Would advise you and watch over you\nNot talking about the world definition of success which is about self ... talking about gods definition of success which is about significance who significance in life and I want to end that versus the circle of words your life that you know that God has a definition of success\nAnd the words your life that you know that God has a definition of success a plan for your life and as you and I listen to him to get this on track with his plan for our live your life a customized path just for you in fact somewhere in a in a corner of her outlined this might want to write these words that went to write this down the more I listen to God\nThe more effective I'll be\nSo these are the three benefits of hearing God's speak\nNow let's look at how do I prepare to here gods voice will therefore things in this story first number one if you want to hear God's speak you must first cultivate an open mind\nAn open mind and what does that mean it means you've got to be receptive you've got to be willing you've got to be open you've got to be eager you've got to be ready because the number one barrier to hearing God's speak\nIs resistance\nI don't think I mean they're gods speak\nI don't believe in God can speak and so many people are even close to the possibility that God might speak to them listen if you don't think God can or will speak to guess what he won't\nIt was amazing to me how many people as world think they are open minded but they're not\nEspecially when it comes to God they're very close minded and they don't even believe in the possibility they're not even open to that possibility that God could speak to them they've been brainwashed by society and they are\nClosed minded\nThat was just what Jesus talk about in the first plane to soil the foot past soil and look eight five and says this\nFarmer went out so a seed\nAnd as he was scattering the seed son fell along the path is talking about the foot path in the farm and it was trampled on\nAnd the birds or the air ate it up now on a farm between the rows of vegetables they're our foot paths you've seen these their foot pass up the workers walk through when they're picking the strawberries or whatever the corn there's a path\nBetween each row of a vote whatever your growing and as workers would walk down this pathway\nMany many times it becomes trampled down the soil becomes Compaq then\nIt gets really hard and if by accident some of that scene that the the\nFarmers thrown out there happens to land on the hard compact and soil of the foot path there's no way it's going to sprout it's not going to take root it's not going to get under it just lays on the surface and tell a burden comes along and and he said the way it never gets a chance to sprout\nNow Jesus gives us the meaning of this down and verse twelve\nHe says there those along the foot paths\nAre the ones who here and then the devil comes along and takes away the word from their heart so they cannot believe and be safe\nNow there are two characteristics of a foot path\nDo you know any mines like that\nI Know a lot of people who have a closed mind art art and the narrow view of life\nAnd they're very very close to even the possibility of God and now I I don't need God I don't want God I don't even know if I Believe in God\nAnd they are so close mine the scene God can never get through to talk to them", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "21"}
