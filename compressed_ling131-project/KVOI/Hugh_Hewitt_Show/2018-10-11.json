angle humanly possible it just handed us the or\nThe capital media services showing that the clean energy for healthy Arizona is now going to spend almost four million bucks on TV ads calling uh the guy who pretends to be attorney general corrupt and urging voters to turn them out of office and the support prop one twenty seven\nYeah again that's part of that kind of thirty million dollars that's been pledged into Arizona on this is a a new kind of injury by Tom ... with us about four million dollars and debris and images race on again it as attacking him it's attacking proposition one twenty seven and\nThey're trying to create a scandal there um for truthful language that was put it into the proposition on you know in my opinion and then a lot of people's opinion brand which was given the facts he was telling people hey the proposition is going to go through and it doesn't matter what the cost to the consumer uh this has gone on the ballot and if it goes through your rates will likely increase\nSo what are we talking about on rate increase what what what uh what have you guys who would have some smarter people than you and I figure it out on how much this would actually cost extra yeah people's pockets\nThere's a few different studies so obviously we have a couple of different utility companies in Arizona a PS on there was a study put out from asking you that says it's gonna be about a thousand to Nineteen hundred dollar increase with of course the year for your average ATF Caesar\nFor T. E. pi they put out a study on that essentially says it's going to increase about four hundred and ... I think for nine fifty dollars here\nOver the course of the year for the average GDP user are all co ops are going to go up about forty percent on so all over the state these utilities are increasing because the infrastructure that it's going to have to go in so quickly to abide by this proposition is going to cost a lot of money\nHave any other states pass something similar with us or are we testing\nYeah California actually pass something very similar back in two thousand Fifteen cents then they'd actually feeding their utility prices increase that three times the national average\nAlso just said no to everyone out there there are also pain Arizona to take a solar energy because they don't have the capability yet to store that energy so they're having to give it away right away we're buying it and are also buying power from us from Palo Verde nuclear generating station so that's actually three different costs that they are paying to have this initiative and their state\nI had a friend who moved from because of a job from uh north Phoenix\nTo Palm Desert and he cannot believe what his electrical yeah it is off his ...\nYeah it's crazy I mean you can see them out of people that are obviously flooding into Arizona from California from the states that have these utility rates and they're coming to Arizona because they can't afford to live there anymore and now unfortunately it's creeping into our state and that's obviously why him out to tell people that don't know because I don't want to be like California I Love the state I grew up here\nUm and you know I think we've done a relatively good job of keeping rates low and I definitely don't want to see an increase so I don't know what prop one twenty seven so there's a\nCity in Arizona who might fall in love with prop one twenty seven it's our good friends within the confines of the city of Tucson explain explain that battle\nYeah so actually we're doing a lot better and the Pima County area than we would have thought on so we had actually a lot of local endorsements here and Pima County so that people counsel for Eighteen actually just came out in support of us on they're talking about obviously are older population in Arizona and how this proposition will affect them\nOr they're saying that about ten percent of the older aging population in Pima lives under or at\nThe poverty level that's about twelve grand an income a year on the proposition if it goes through at a hundred or sorry four hundred and fifty dollars extra year that's four percent of their income but I'm going to be going to utility prices that's a lot of money but how about any\nOther organizations that work with the poor because to some Pima County where one of the poorest places in the southwest has anyone come out and said this is the problem\nTucson United Way has also opposes proposition as well as you know that the Tucson United Way in the south west on United Way had come out in opposition to this proposition again you know saying as a lot of people say as I say at the money all really great to move toward renewables it's really great to move toward clean energy but\nIt's really great to move toward renewables it's really great to have moved toward clean energy but this proposition doing that at the expense of the consumer and as a rate that's just not helpful to the state of Arizona\nBut governments slamming a technology on you that hasn't gotten there yet we saw during all the subsidies there'll be Obama's ... yeah I mean this is ... ... lives in work yet\nIt doesn't and I think America has proven that were pretty good at advancing technology with out in the in the run and Arizona right now is already the third largest producer of solar energy in the United states on the other side would like to say you know we're only at six percent six percent of solar production is still the third largest production of solar energy in the United states\nSo we are in advance or a a you know\nA beacon to show in advancing in renewable energy um and we did that with you know without mandates we did that on our own and we have a mandate actually in place right now to get to Fifteen Percent renewable energy\nBy twenty twenty five so we're moving in the right direction and we're doing it at a way that it's keeping our utility prices low and it's you know friendly to on both rape parents also are are companies out there that are trying to make a living as well\nSo the two reasons I assume Tom Sawyer chose Arizona is because one it's easy to get stuff on the ballot into they're still trying to drive Democrats to the polls show good people in their\nYup so you can see the state these targeting are Arizona and Nevada excuse me on to states obviously that Democrats are trying to push 'em over to the blue side to create that blue wave 'em like I said that thirty million dollars is definitely an indication of trying to turn out the vote in Arizona for Democrats\nUm so he's he's targeting Arizona for that we are a state that allows out of state money to come in and find a proposition um so we are a target from that standpoint as well\nUh the average folks listening to the radio right now you know breakfast what can they do to help shoot down prop one twenty seven other than vote no on the ballot show up\nThis way yeah um well other than that now which is definitely number one priority for all you out there um I Would say tell your friends because they're proposing as clean energy for helping Arizona and some people might think it sounds good I mean who doesn't want that for their environment I Know ideal but unfortunately this proposition is not doing that in a way that it's effective\nFor the consumer on fat would encourage you to tell your friend tell your neighbors to vote now tell them why I'm and let them know that you know moving toward her new book is a great way are great thing to do by proposition one twenty seven is not the right way to do it and a website that can go to\nSo no easy energy tax is our Facebook page definitely go there click like Cher I post that's a really great way to get the word out also um vote no problems though no
