area why would you not move them first to write that\nI think it's a fair question you know the question that we have to ask a of the military or the only response I could I could muster right now is

it did a Michael was initially supposed to be a tropical storm for that area before the end all took a direct hit and so I think that's a fair question hopefully from this week and\nIdentify some key lessons learned um we can avoid making the same mistake in the future but again we need the appropriate you know the officials to testify before the house armed services committee to figure out exactly what's happening here because of course the air force is putting their spin on it it's hard to get an accurate picture of exactly what happened and who made the decision\nYou know I read that it would require ten million dollars to reopen the line\nAnd I thought to myself that is next to nothing compared to the strategic advantage this particular playing gives us over our near tear are near peer China I mean not it really is almost nothing if it had to go back and start producing these planes do you think we should\nWell by the ethical I've seen is that it would take two billion in five years to restart the line but it just a question of what timeframe or would have\nSome since you're making get the clients that have production um I think I I tend to disagree although more planes will be better and obviously he did he go back and look at that you'd have nine decision with\nA lot of regret but we really need to do is we look through the prism of this long journey great our competition with China and the capabilities China is developing its windows salary to be Twenty one production in order to get range back into the air force\nAnd therefore reallocate some of the balance from fighters to bombers that's really the challenge that it was ended by China and rising great powers and so we need to get that range ... ideally you could do a bit of both but you know resource constrained environment you have to make very difficult decisions like that\nRight now let's talk about what you wrote for real clear defense this week about but maybe it would you summarize what your article is and people can find it by Googling Mike Gallagher and real clear defense\nWell he was you know I'm Irish Catholic so I'm always walking around with guilt over things they did or didn't do and I felt guilty after our discussion and last week I did it feel like an answer your\nYou do and I felt guilty after our discussion last week I did it feel like an answer your question about where's the plan for three and a fifty five ships and so I went and I started writing my thoughts on paper and talking to a a bunch of people because as you pointed out a three hundred and fifty five shit ... was that they can get your defense\nCampaign promise that then candidate Trump and basically the vice president talk with you that state you know there's more to follow\nA well I don't think that ... right now the question is if the navy backtrack\nWe had a shoot out in force structure assessment that endorsed that three hundred and fifty five ship number now since then we've had a change in administration and the new defense strategy and in light of these changes it makes sense but maybe wants to review the composition of its future flee the problem however\nIs the way in which this happening back in March the navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structures that then\nThen they re announced a forthcoming new is that just last month do sometime and twenty Nineteen what we don't really know is what they've been doing in the in between his announcement or why the new study won't be out more than one year after the end yes so I guess you if I could summarize\nWhy are we commissioning a whole host of new studies when we have the three hundred and fifty five shit number that's been endorsed by the navy itself\nBy numerous out that if that meant and by the president himself as we know from the experience of the Reagan Administration\nThe windows to make change it ran thought they really in the first two years of it and then a straight shot and tasks that the bureaucracy starts doing anything it restores the status quo and so I see here we are missing a key windows here and I want the navy to tell us\nWhat's going to come from these new assessment because if he is definitely comes back that\nJust kidding we only need three hundred and thirty ships for whatever reason that it's on it\nDo you think the president and Israel where that he's being slow roll by the navy bureaucracy 'cause that's what I think is happening and I had Richard Spencer I'm On the head and MSNBC show show no nowhere to get your plan and honestly I I think the president thinks there's a plant up there for two hundred and fifty five ships and nobody tells them no it's not there\nI Know where the president is that is a busy man I got out to worry about he needs to expect\nThat when he gives a clear direction to its service secretary of you is is is checked I ... and the service sector is that that ... executed with laxity and so I don't think the President's Day you're having this discussion I think your interview with\nHopefully will serve as a wake up call for the White House but it's going to take that presidential level involvement pushing the navy pushing the department of defense to go as fast as possible because if you're actually will always invent ... and you can ... cubic rationale as an excuse for not building worship\nWell I Hope you are right I've just re tweeted out everybody ought to go and read my Gallagher's calm but maybe the nation needs now in real clear defense and congressman\nGood luck to you by this week this time tomorrow if we got to be talking about the browns and I honestly I don't know if they're in Rogers can make it to the halfway point of the season so we'll see about that but thank you congressman

I feel like a sad thing that's going on is a lot of them really amazing mechanics that I Know are somewhere between fifty five and Seventy years old\nSo my my mechanic that I've used for years is sixty three years old\nAnd I'm so worried that there's not that next generation of mechanics that are getting trained to fill in those as it moves through our mind is that an accurate statement the fish should be worried about the next generation coming in\nYou're worried about an hour [laughter]\nI got to have some employees to do the stuff we do and and there's very very few are young people that are interested\nIn a you know I grew up in the euro in Europe on cars we're uh\nWe're we're just part of the scene you know everybody went down to Kevin do Pontiac in September and looked at the new Pontiac and you know that kind of things right and uh [noise] now of course Pontiac isn't even there anymore so [noise] but uh cars were a bigger part of our lives back then and now they're just a convenient\nYou know they just get you from point a to point B and nobody really cares about him and the young people don't don't want to know about him other than ...\nAnd again it it it pays a great a great hourly wage to be a mechanic you have pretty much job security yeah we need to get me to get better\nIn getting young folks and ...\nYou know I I was very sad to see a lot of the high schools close up their automotive programs and it just I don't know but it's starting to swing around the other way again and and hopefully er I don't know what probably won't catch up in my lifetime but\nBefore I get to remain here one last question for you what is the one maintenance thing that most people are not doing that you say if you did this we would save you a lot of grief later what is it\nJust there's there's two reasons to change or oil the first reason to change your oil filter a second reason is to have somebody\nThat knows what the cars supposed to be a about get a look at it because nobody ever looked underneath them and nobody ever looks under the hood anymore and there's things that go on in there that where\nThey have to be inspected and and ... before they cause catastrophic problem\nSo that's\nIn a nutshell that's the one thing\nYou change your oil people that's built telling your Bill Nelson automotive over on ... correct It's dry\nYour morning to edge remain a protest gotta G ... voice how're you doing sir not too bad how are you doing today not too bad so what is deeply voice do\nShe'd be voice is a medication company based out of Scottsdale, Arizona jak we've been in business for about twenty five years or providing a id voice in data solutions we have about what over twenty thousand plus ... customers around the country today\nAnd how did you get involved with this company ... this group of a business owner\nOr through other a member from light weights okay\nSo tell me about tell me about the with the age of cell phones and all this stuff how is voice communications and businesses changing right now\nWell actually it's changed quite a bit we're evolving more dependent on communications ah tell everything from cell phones to a\nTo a office a business systems what makes us unique is or anybody can provide dial to into a business but what separates us from the rest is we we do a collaboration of integrating the either an existing system or a new a new white system to current business and uh\nEverybody as I mentioned that does dial tone but the collaboration is the applications that's now available or ten years ago and you know avoid started everybody was yeah I Need a white phones use over the Internet\nNow it's getting more involved where they need those applications will be imbedded to their business to make it more successful\nMadden now one of the biggest problems that I find and telephone you set of business is companies who don't pick up their phone can you help with that yeah [laughter]\n\nYes ... and part of that service is typically a any provide they mentioned the and I and I stress is so much any but he can provide a dialogue so\nBut we're making unique is the the applications us now involves allows your mobile workforce to be to move to be more involved so if I call your desk one today it could all it's an awesome near your cell phone as well but the client that's calling your desk and doesn't know that they're calling your cell phone\nSo so as a guy who's been doing this for a while when you call up anybody maybe you're saving the client you just call up somebody who has a voice system mhm what is the number one sim that you see in people when they do and they set up their voice mail\nAnd their voice system what do you see as a ... kind of a mistake that you kinda go oh said they're doing that what do you what what does that moment not picking up the phone rang [laughter]\n\nReally it's you know it's his do invest all this money in the system but yet\nHalf of the half of the features and aren't being used because they're not being properly trained right and that's what makes us unique is we're able to really they dive into the the services of the business before we even talk about what are what are called system can do to\nIs the one that I Would say the second thing is people who have too long of a ... message on my gosh yes so I had a client that I work with because I Do consulting right and we're listening to the thing and if the owner of the business thing if you want this you want this if you want this you want and it goes on for like a minute right\nThen I said can we just so we changed it I said\nCan you just say that a human being will talk to you and the next few seconds\nThe key to say that a human being will talk to you and the next few seconds yet so [laughter] you know typically what you call those\nId our trees and more a more everyday business are getting more in tune to that but you know when you deliver voice system you either having empower the decline W permit you control that are the are or you give the the caller that unique phone number that just to do with this system that might that that idea\nHow do people get a hold of you if they want to review what they're doing with their voices\nOn my gosh it's great a very simple my email address is really a GPS Judy boys\nDot com also was great media today sir and this is again what you do something that's kind of a common part of the businesses that I think is under used and abused a little bit and if they use their wives or they might be able to put a few more dollars in their book\nNot just that but just cause it out we're able so far at least fifty percent off the top easily wow All right GPA a gp voice yes All right Jeremy nice meeting you and I
