my city government\nAre and what we have done is we welcome that man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI by comparison to how Methodist dance deals with the FBI\nOr he has gone out of his way before he quit his job in Congress to protect a Donald Trump or to curb a B inquiry by Mr Mahler\nOr he is not even so far ... jets at some deep state is that worked to undermine the president say I mean the

you shouldn't have had he shouldn't have gotten the Broadway tickets he shouldn't have gotten a trip to Costa Rica and then you give something to someone in return he gave two million dollars today a mafia\nBam bam bam I don't know how Andrew Gillum wins this thing around the census is eight straight shooting prosecutor Harvard law school graduate navy veteran and Florida is booming now they've

if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe or or the weight of glory and other s as\nThere is so much weight there that starts from that assumption\nOf a modern day sort of the Judeo Christian tradition the assumptions that people are created in the image of God and they have dignity so human cells are immortal and so if you treat people like that it means that even if I if it was somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative\nPriorities and policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that they're human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... at the center of a line before them that baby the parents to align that's coming after them and if my neighbor Fort doors down and I for

together and I'm going to sweep the kid up in my driveway if she skins are neat falling off the bike\nLike that not go ahead that is the that is the rediscovery of community but NO PLAN for me senator Sasse to a problem which I've been talking about all morning\nThere were seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be kept him to the mob you\nCan't march into America and it's seven thousand people can next time it'll be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand how do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem started decades and the comment\n... part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send the clearer signal and Central America that the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the image of God that we can distinguish it we have more time between the electrical right just as a civil rights but human traffickers\nAre in Central America told people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments added that\nTo say we can get your kids into the U.S\nThey told them that the US's catch and release policy\nIn twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S the U.S has to have borders every nation has to have orders and if you're going to secure your border that\nMeans you run it stopped the upstream hurt in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't pet process the backlog and sold immediately just released these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month asked until their trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut I asked the percentage of them don't ever show up for their trials that are for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long we need to send a signal\nThat the U.S has border is hard and getting harder and beats your heart and more\nAnd that you won't get in under that dumped catch and release policy and at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continued articulate the US's grander vision of seven and a half billion people could being created with dignity that doesn't mean the free passage in the United states where\nThe fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country let me play for you and says we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been

it off\nTo stop so Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window if the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings the caused America to shutter\n[noise] well I I Want to be delicate about this because I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America now thirty five no I'm no I'm you know are trying to think ooh\nMy ... my favorite ... at the moment as ... bowling expert but when you have a gender gap a plus thirty five a historically Republican usually trial you know for to ten point\nA witch when a when you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus for teenage or for Republicans with Ben sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the Kavanaugh hearings um but I think in the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC\nI'm I think the me too movement is incredibly important because I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the V. chip and is on that a very good thing\nBut I think you saw it in the cabin not hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition\nOf rights not just of the accuser but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the Kavanaugh hearings like there's no such thing as a right of the accused and I think um you know moms and dads don't want that for their sons they don't sexual violence for their daughters of that they want a world where there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening in that media circus\nA very quick edited a senator in my case it says to justice ... with your God that's kind of internalizing every Christian in America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean ... ... the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV um happens like that for so many people who are the politically addicted class of washing\nThat is because I think and again why I wrote the book them of of upstream things that are

your life something is fundamentally broken\nWe won't come back and talk more about them next week the new book by Senator Ben Sasse when I'm back in my voice is whole senator says thank you really
