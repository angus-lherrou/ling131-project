in the budget\nIt don't work right he actually had one called shrimp fight club right you know I remember it was one of the things it was great that he pointed out right where the CDC or no or

he dealt with that waste yeah you get the press releases on this all the ...\nDid you ever do anything about it did you ever see Jeff Flake say hey\nI'm going to pass a bill that does it I didn't have

younger generation which they wanted and a bunch of you said you were in same Chris well it kind of turned out the kind of worked out that way but let me give you the ... valley inside of this one\nMay be\nPart of the thing for some of these votes like Murkowski and Collins is they let Jeff take the flack for giving an extra seven days for this quote extra FBI invest\nAnd then they can say hey we gave him that one extra shot we can vote for Kavanaugh in good ... good conscience I'm just telling you may be because\nJeff was the guy not running for re election\nThey don't get me wrong I don't respect that much Jeff Flake if you've heard the show you know I'm not a flake fan but maybe Jeff Flake was the sacrificial lamb here to give these\nSome of these ... votes and that could be Republicans and it could be Democrats on the bubble like a mansion or something like that but maybe Murkowski and Collins said\nJeff Jeff forgive you do this we know we can vote it we can sell it better to our constituents saying after we did all this the guy had five\nInvestigations by the FBI previously I mean you don't go move up through the judge ranks without the FBI doing background checks on you all the time so for summer politically they think they needed that one extra week\n\nTo make themselves feel better and then they can sell that to their constituents when it comes up saying this guy already had five FBI and we gave it one extra week for them to find\nAnything else they could about what ever happened was lazy forward\nMaybe that's what happened maybe that's what Jeff is doing here now is Jeff kind of a flake wishy washy show but I'm just throwing that one at ya just maybe just maybe\nSo the thing about any already came out with a press release right that said he was banned for\nKavanaugh right\nRight so I'm thinking again I'm just going ... valley on this thing maybe he's just the fall guy to give some of these other folks out one extra little thing that they can throw out saying hey we gave it an extra week\nAbsolutely but if you sat there and and told us\nUm like he said he just looked at us until this man he's real conservative and this is like the best opportunity we have to have the court\nWhere the court is going to judge is going to be based on protecting our rights as as American citizens and you know regardless of what the shrill the
