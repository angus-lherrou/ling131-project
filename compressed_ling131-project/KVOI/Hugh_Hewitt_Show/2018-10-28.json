radio I joined crews were going to tell you about a place\nYou may not you know that's a great learning gets an agent sunflower state the state of Kansas in with us here till you more about it is Mike Miller who works for the state and knows all about hunting and fishing there Mike welcome to the show\nGlad to be here John So Mike let's start off with deer because I think most folks do know the Kansas is a great place to look for white tailed deer in November is a really good time to go after\nYeah we're kind of known as one of those a trophy whitetail destination states and and that that has just really you know grown in an interest over the last\nSay seven or eight years we've always had a one block policy for residents and non residents and I think that's allowed I think our biggest secret us we let there get to be four and a half and five and a half years old and that's one of the reasons we have you know good trophy a deer are usually starts the er into October that first week of November and that's when\nThe ball hunters really like to be in the woods here because when the wreckage going you know things get crazy\nWhen it comes to non residents opportunities how does that work in terms of getting a tag in terms of getting access is there a lot of public land or is it mostly private land announce that are you working with\nWell the first question is it is a limited draw for\nA non resident hunters the application period of the month of April and it's an online application that you can make to our website at ... dot com\nAnd then there is a drawing held um success\nRates are very high we set our quotas to try to meet demand demand has shifted and has increased in some units in recent years and so in the eastern part of the state where we used to have leftover permits we're now seeing some of those units over subscribed but we do have adjustment factors and we do make adjustments from year to year that application period again is in the month of April and you'll need to do that\nTo be ready for the next year season\nRegarding access is there a lot of public lands for hunters to find their or is it mainly working through private outfitters and getting on leased lands\nWell Kansas is a private land states so it's Ninety seven percent privately owned so most of our hunting does occur on private lands we manage how probably close to one point seven\nMillion acres most of that one million acres of that is in our walking hunting access program which is private lands release as an agency and open to public counting\nThe rest of that is in you know areas around reservoirs and lands that we own and manage for public land so again most of the hunting is done on private land so you need to either have a contract with landowners were worked through an outfit or\nAll right so I was going to ask you about el because folks believe it or not I didn't know this there is no hunting to be had in Kansas but it's very limited it's only open to the residents so let's turn our focus to birds because I'm guessing you can buy an over the counter license and you can go fishing hunting the Kansas right now\nYou can season opens a second Saturday November this year so it won't open until November tense power it's\nAll you need is a non resident a hunting license which is Ninety seven dollars and fifty cents to season last in the end of January\nAnd our licenses as of this year or three hundred and sixty five day licenses so if you buy a license now it's going to be good through the entire pheasant season um we're always in one of the top three states in the nation for pheasant harvest I think last year we were probably number two we're looking at\nWhat we consider a fairly good size and hunting and most of our primary regions this year um we'd come off a\nSeries of dry winters and so that isn't the best\nNesting habitat for pheasant or early in the spring but we still are going to be one of the top states for pheasant hunting this year again\nAnd when it comes to a plan birds I'm guessing it yet says in you've probably got a pretty healthy population of ... too don't ya\nYeah we were actually the top state in the nature for harvest last year or we're usually right there with Oklahoma Texas as far as harvest\nAnd we've we've seen in the last three years on modern quail boom especially in the north central south central and south west parts of our state and the the dry winters haven't heard ... because we started getting rains and in fact April and may and the way on this later than pheasants and so our by by populations have been very very good the last few years\nGetting back to access so you already explained that primarily we're talking private lands here the state does have a lot of land center manages walking property is that what these up Lindbergh hundreds are taking advantage of the seats walking properties or they again going with private out centers\nYou know the the Milwaukee and properties or wherever and hunters really shine because a lot of times it's the R. P. E. or it's native grass or it's the deer hunting leases are really tough for us to compete with because of what people are willing to pay as to how white tailed deer or we can lease lands that are very good bird hunting\nAnd solve pardon majority of our uh walking areas in the western part of the state our for our good for up on birds and so we have an atlas we call it or you know our hunting outlets that\nWe make available online and we have printed copies all male to people they can pick them up wherever they buy their license\nAnd it shows all of our walking areas as well as our federal and state areas so guy can pick up one of these and and really travel around and look at these areas and find a lot of good bird hunting I'm areas it's like anything you have to do a little bit of scouting cars from one year to the next farming practices\nChange whether you know a circumstances are different and so it does take a little bit the groundwork for the hunter but you've got a million and a half acres at your fingertips without Alice\nYou're listening to America outdoors radio we're talking with Mike Miller with the Kansas department of wildlife parks and tourism about ... eighty three thousand square miles of hunting opportunities along with the bird watching that weight in the sunflower state so we talked about citizens who talked about well we talked about here all great opportunity\nThis is going to be a big economic boom to the state of Kansas\nAbsolutely you know how to spend over well over four hundred million dollars a year and Kansas I'm In the western part of the state it's it's a it's really important to a lot of those rural communities I grew up in one of those communities and that was the only time I ever saw the motels in our town full\nWas that opening weekend and maybe that second weekend has an season and so it's a big deal there they roll out the red carpet for bird hunters and hunters in general um they have hunter breakfast their their dog friendly motels they really do I want to attract an accommodate hunters in these smaller communities in western Kansas\nI'll tell you what you've got people to come out to yeah just right now to a joint some of that but one other opportunity when he's talking about cutting I don't think most people think of Kansas is a great duck hunting states but you've got a lot of opportunities for both ducks and geese don't ya\nWe do you know again were highly agricultural and so we have some large marshes reservoirs are through the central part of the state in eastern part of the state and so the waterfowl will come and when we have good water conditions like we do this year we had an awful lot of rain the last two months those waterfowl steak action\nCase both will stay in the area for a link of the fall because there's so much food available they can roost on the reservoirs and marshes and then she'd on a harvest the crop feels that are just you know a short distance away from anywhere in Kansas basically because we are so agricultural so we can have some very good\nA duck and goose hunting pedal less clear and to you know the late fees and settled go into a February so we can have some really really find waterfowl hunting for both ducks and geese\nWell there you have it folks as you just heard Kansas is definitely worth a hard look and I'd say a trip whether you're a white tailed deer hunter whether Europe doesn't hunter whether you want to go after Bob like well or if you want to go after ducks and geese\nThe sunflower state is definitely the place to go what's the website where folks can find out more and start planning a trip like\nIt's WWW dot ... dot com and you can find everything you need you can buy your licenses we try to be a one stop shop a website for

through and Luke nine sixty one another said\nGo home and say good bye\nTo my family\nFrom\nThat sounds to me like a full thing why\nThat made sense to me at least as I first looked at this the proper protocol it sounds like the proper chain of command\nIt sounds like kindness let me go home and say\nI'm leaving home by by\nJust want you to know whether to come by and say I believe and everything to follow Jesus ...\nEven as I say it you begin to see there's little absurdity here isn't there you know what this guy was asking for\nHe was literally saying let me go home and get the good buys of my family and get the approval of my family to get the blessing of my family\nTo say how did you just respond to this did he say hey go home have a hope\nSee the family votes for you to give up everything and follow me\nShe'll vote for that\nHere's how Jesus responded to that he said no one who puts his hand or the plowing looks back his fifth or the kingdom of God\n\n\nThat sound like good family principled onto\nJesus was probably the harshest went on this\nHere's the thing Phil how many of you would be following the lord how many of you would be doing what you do now how many of you\nWould have walked this way with the lord if it had been the result of a family about\n\nHow many of your family if you went to them as a non believer and they weren't unbelievers and you said\nYour boy I have met Jesus my life has changed I Am giving up everything\nThey go and follow him\nAnd I'll be meeting with a lot of other strange people like that you don't know um but I'll be with them a lot\nMaybe more than I'm with you [noise]\nWould they vote for that\nWhere they give you\nOf course not\nNow Jesus Says he talks about there's very kind of phenomenon is saying that it is not\nYour temporary family that decides kingdom principled for you it is the eternal kingdom of God that decides kingdom principles\nHow wait a minute or when are you telling me that when I become a Christian I'm supposed to abandon my other family I'm supposed to just say I'm a Christian and we'll have anything to do with either now ... what I'm saying at all\nWhat I'm saying is that now you get your signals from an eternal source you get your signals from the kingdom of God or no family was ever as loving has got our father was no family ever talk you out a lot like Jesus taught you how to love the son of God whom the father says that there's my son\nListened to him and Jesus is love one another as I have\nLoved you here's what happens when you become a member of the eternal family you treat your temporary family better than you ever\nDid before you're just no longer in bondage\nNo longer call your kingdom shots for you you are willing if need if you call in\nIf you are willing if need if indeed you are willing to go anywhere [noise] God sends you even if they say you'll you'll never get anything from severe to that\nAnd say that's okay that's okay you can give it to somebody else I I just got to follow Jesus math\nAnd you're making eternal decisions out of the eternal kingdom and the internal family rather than because the temporary family which may not follow the law would make those decisions for you I have seen in the course of life individuals who because of that temporary family\nThat did not follow the lord made decisions that were costly the kingdom out of a sick bondage to contemporary families thinking erroneously the wolf I Do\nThis you know be able to win them to the lord but close this never be got health\nBegets\nRighteousness\nBegets righteousness following Jesus\nWill cause you to be more loving to your family temporary than you ever could have been before because now you're loving them through the eyes of Jesus and not through\nBondage to family\nIs this getting clear yet what I'm saying you see Jesus really does affirmed family in its finest form\nBy creating a new one that will treat the old one better than it's ever been treated

Speaks to the Bible\nGod Speaks to gifted teachers God Speaks to godly friends and family got speaks the impression the speech to pain and number six God Speaks\nTo silence\nTo silence sometimes God Speaks by saying nothing\nSometimes God Speaks by remaining quiet\nNow this is extremely frustrating to us\nBut God has his reasons when he's quiet and silent\nAnd you'd better just wait and trust him if you run ahead a God if you go ahead and say well I haven't heard anything from God so I'm just gonna go ahead and do this\nAnd if you don't trust God\nYou'll get yourself into a lot of trouble\nWhen you run ahead a God you're going to regret it you're going to have all kinds of problems there are so many examples of this in the Bible one of them was the guy names saw king saw and he was the first king of Israel and he was getting ready to go to battle but he hadn't really been right with God and so then he comes to God's of God\nOr what do you want me to do in this battle when he hadn't been talking and got a long time\nBeen doing the wrong things and the Bible says God was silent he wasn't ready to say\nAnd noticed what it says in for ... twenty six\nSalt pray to God\nBut God didn't answer\nNeither by dream nor by sign nor by profit in other words the three different ways that salt tried to find out an answer it he didn't hit it and so you know what happened\nHe got impatient\nWhen you do that you're always said if for trouble\nImpatient and\nWhen you do that you're always said it for trouble he got desperate and he turned\nSomething here outlawed in the country he said go find me a spiritual\nAdviser go find me a medium a psychic which don't find that some of the top of that ad go find some person who can conjure up spirit you're doing say he knew what was wrong and he did it anyway because he got desperate and do you know what happened\nHe lost everything\nHe lost the battle\nHe lost his reputation he lost his life\nThis is not innocent stuff\nI remember years ago in this very church a young woman who was frantic about trying to figure out the name of who is she was supposed to marry and she prayed and God didn't write the guy's name on a card he rarely does because there might be a half a dozen people that are all okay for you to marry in God's will there is no one single right person\nAs he got very desperate so she got involved in\nA a cult in tarot cards and horoscopes and astrology\nAnd it really messed her up\nIf you were looking to anything else besides God for guidance you are on thin ice if you were looking to anything else in your life to guide you\nAbout the future\nExcept God you have an idle at it is wrong and you should run from it as fast as you can this is not innocent stuff\nNow let me tell you why first place it's a total waste of money nobody knows the future nobody anybody and tells you they know in the future is flat outline 'cause only God Knows the future nobody knows the future and the future is not in the stars it's in the sun the son of God\nAnd it's all a lie\nAnd if you do it it's a sin and you will be judged for it and it is the devil and you could lose your soul you run from it as fast as you can\nSo what do you do when God is silent\nWhat do you do you do two things and we have these two versus first job thirty four if God is silent\nQuarters that to you since he turns of space away what can you do about it but whether silent fourth hidden he's their ruling here is the first thing you remember God is in control he's there really\nGod may not share his plan with you but it got me to have a plant oh he's got one he has a plan and purpose for your life he loves you he's a good God and they'll take care of you if\nYou will just wait on him he is in charge and you're not number two you trust him so I'm fifty verse fourteen I Want you to trust me in your time of trouble so I couldn't rescue you and you can give me glory\nYou know I think God is asking that question of you today God is asking you will you trust me\nWell you don't trust me with that financial problem well you don't trust me", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day":
