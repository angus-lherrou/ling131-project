he is a fascinating story folks of what can be accomplished in America if you believe in yourself you got the guts to go for it and what can be accomplished so let's welcome our guest pat and the governor pat welcome to legends of success\nJohn though either to be with us today\nWe are honored to have you and and I mentioned to you and I just I guess alluded to the folks as I was researching the story of your life you know we try to have a capsule or a witch hunt and capital just a moment\nThe picture of ideology or guess businesses and diverse of occasions if we listed everything you do have to get a second hour\nSo his diversification if we listed everything you do and how to get a second hour so [laughter] but much for the listeners them give us a snapshot pat of ideology and other divisions so they can see a picture of who you are and what you do okay\nYes why did you have sort of a single mission that try to provide information about information technology to people all over the world uh we do this through three at three hundred magazines newspapers that we've published over eighty five countries\nThere's no hope for recovery we won't leave one warrior behind\nNot on our want\nFind out how you can do your part\nThat sign W. W. dot org\nYoung people everywhere are making a different\nSong hold down and have more in the wild\nLand about\n... four and a very hot\nGet involved in national and not on loan\n\nHi this is Steve forms of Forbes magazine\nWhen you want to learn to America's most successful people are\nRead are formed four hundred lists when you want to hear firsthand how they got there and listen to him legends of success with John resident legends of success was one of the most original radio programs in years legend some success was John residents in the founder and\nChairman of the international multibillion dollar international data group is our exclusive guest and legends of success today\nBefore we took a break a we're talking about what influence patch young life of me today folks um this public knowledge he's well placed on the Forbes four hundred listed a couple of billion dollars of net worth it's public knowledge but the point is how did he get there and what does he do with the money as a steward we're going to find that out a little bit later to\nGo back in the beginning of your life was a young man young a boy pat\nYou have um I call you a member of the influential mothers club a member of the Celtic they're wrong\nThe other two members were Jack Welch Bernie Marcus both of these guys credited jak well of course the legendary she goes GE and burning Marcus go Home Depot they both predator mothers having a strong influence that impacted the life\nFor many years to come you found that is well did you not\nYet has certainly in my case as well uh my father was a manager of construction projects but it's a very many of them were you know in Europe or in Asia and so he was gone for you know six months or a or nine months or so at a time\nSo my mother probably the biggest influence and I'm telling my goals and values and\nOne thing that she really killed on me is that knowledge is key to progress you know and you should learn as much as possible you should do well in school and you should use out of your other time to learn and so I became a very active member of the local public library and going in there every\nFucking for all the exciting new bucks it would come in and I remember one time I Try to read all\nTwenty volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica\nOn the basis that are not I would have a database of everything that has happened in the world but then I realize that uh that I was really only have ... everything that happened before or the book was published though I realize the important thing is keeping up to date with a new trend in the market\nI I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead influence you a little bit\n[noise] yeah I certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was ... you know they were I was actually working for me to come around and drop the newspaper of the day off if they're on their front step um and and then I could tell from um you know when I was coming in to make their collections now Saturday to\nUh for the deliveries as they would be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nGreatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis at every day a week\nOr wouldn't moving on 'em you went to parochial schools as a young man as a boy and um tell me a little bit about St Martin in Philadelphia was there an advantage or disadvantage going to a parochial school would not do very\nWell I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on the quality of education and making sure that we were learning and doing well in our uh our past I'm going forward so that was a helpful and they certainly instilled the\nBelief and the importance of living on moral and ethical wife and ah you know and I realize that God is an important\nA factor in your life and that she should follow the commandments and should treat people with respect and I'm I'm that you should make sure that you do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of and do it right in the long run you\nYou'll wind up having the best result\nAnd what you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\nOh exactly and that usually a pay it pays off I think you know what goes around comes around with you\nAnd they have ... you know ways to to see other people pretty soon that a deception is known and then people you know you lose their confidence and you and if they\nLose you the confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not going to trust you and follow your ideas is ingestion so\nUm it is a very counterproductive to you know take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nHad during your time and St Martin high school um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA Oh yes was they had the various wars the medals for the best in each subject than the\nUh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and er because I was a you know wanted to uh get on the top of all the lists are so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things I was going to look to eventually you went from St Martin's you got accepted\nMIT my records tell me you were the first student from St Martin to ever get accepted to MIT tell the listeners what you did sister so creative um the project they got the attention that got you an MIT\nYeah ... you know I just mention that go to the public library of several times a week and a one day I went in there and Nineteen fifty three and there was a new book that has just been published and was available called giant brains machines that I think it was first book that tried to explain how could be the new computer technology would really enhance\nThe power of the human mind would extend the memory facts available to people greatly with be able to\nSee patterns and data super high speeds and ... ally to make more insightful decisions and be more productive so I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of saving semi paper with those every and went down to the hardware store and\nAnd bought strip civil looming them for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs uh\nFrom flashlights and plywood boards and and a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made of a little relays or that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe\nAh so it's a and then I found that when I gave it to my friends are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they notice they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back of every uh forty F move with the random occasionally they could win the last ... found that ah that factor of hope I made the machine very very popular and who is always lots of people queuing up to a play at\nThe biggest would love you [laughter] and\nIt was you know they entered into a science fair and what a prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia\nA now to get me a full scholarship to go to MIT to study a more seriously computer science and particularly ah I was excited about the idea of fuel on if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective than they used for people because she would see the analogy between the human intelligence and then the intelligence created through\nThe electronic design of these systems\nNow pat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encouraged or discouraged from director or the new specials at your school\n[noise] ah well that was an interesting point when I did that get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic schools and the director says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that they're ...\nWho've Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that they're in the Catholic tradition and\nI said right now appreciate that but uh I Would like to know forget myself I'm interested in technology and I want to go to school that has the best reputation for teaching technology and you know the the course they'll have a chaplain there and I'll be able to\nContinue to attend religious services so I uh I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could've subject\nI was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but ah I just stuck to my commitment\nYou'll be fine my research said that the way you're gonna get in there ...\nThere were a big uh I'm uh twenty thousand students before me that uh and never had a five and has ever been accepted thought it was the first one they have to to MIT\nWow boy I liked that business model [laughter] I call the\nUh the publisher of the magazine owner of the magazine I said I've\nTalked to the head of the a computer company they want us to the market research and you know um\nWho would you like to be a undertaking that he said no no no that's not my field and if you want to do it on your own You're welcome to take the risk so I went um I saw that interview with on friday\nA over the weekend I wrote a proposal for this research and I had it out to about fourteen companies and to my amazement within two weeks I got a check for twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment\nFrom nine companies so so I had a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars checks I rushed to the bank\nOr because I made up a name called international cooperation at the uh for the proposal purposes it was just going to be a shot in the dark\nAnd then the banks that oh now that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have to form real corporation get by laws have directors authorized the bank account if I thought oh my goodness what happens\nIf all this name has already been registered those who have stuck with fortunately\nIt was in the form the corporation and\nAnd that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company with a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and go I become a big advocate of what we call customer base financing if well you can go out and presented an idea that people interesting enough you know they will they will have makes an advance payments\nAnd when they do that they become a real advocate for you because they want you to succeed and they encourage\nTheir friends to buy the same thing and so they become none equity investors they are all the they don't show up at shareholders meetings and ask a difficult question\nThey don't charge interest on their cash cetera so well I Would say for an entrepreneur deacon a the proof he can prove that market validity by going out and getting advanced payments customers is solid situation\nAnd so what we learn from this that was another rejection the McGovern had another one you had split the other thing that when they're giving you money to it on an advance that sure puts a flame onto your but to make sure that whatever you make it better be darned good range\nA or a rail buggy perform a you know at the highest level of these people are expected\nThe ads all responsibility we get back

details\nWhoever wins control of Congress next month likely will do so with a very slim majority I Will that affect the legislatures ability to govern Andy rights of the club for growth is here\nWith

term elections with very different strategies in urban and rural districts Dr ... from the center for vision and values at ... college has an American radio journal commentary\nTime looming Henry and welcome to American radio journal\nThe constitution of the United states can be changed by amendment or via a convention of states since Congress will probably not reform itself the convention route is more likely to yield results\nMark Meckler is president and founder of convention of the states and convention of states action is here to explain how convention woodworking why it is needed mark welcome to American radio journal mark when we talk about a convention of states it's probably a process\nThat most Americans are not familiar with so tell us what is a convention of states\nYeah you're right it's something we've never done before in our history it's found in article five of the United States Constitution it\nWas literally put there two days before the end of the convention in Seventeen eight seven and it's put their this idea of the states get together and convention put there for the very purpose of\nPushing back against federal overreach and what it is is a process whereby two thirds of the states now thirty four states can get together colic convention get together and convention and discuss ideas\nFor restraining federal overreach and specifically\nThe application we're pursuing right now which has already been passed in twelve states calls for physical restraints on the federal government term limits on the federal government that would include Congress the courts and the bureaucracy and ultimately I think the most important scope and jurisdiction restraints\nAre you finding that the current system the way that it is structured mark particularly with Congress with a lack of term limits and no real limits on power are we finding that this isn't working as well as it did in the early days of the republic\nIs a real reason is is needed is then you referred to structurally broken the structure of government in the United states of America so the structure was set up correctly I think it worked beautifully for the first hundred years and then we started to break that structure\nSo we now need structural reforms and the only way to get structural reforms is by calling a convention and imposing a structural reforms one great example is terminal is simply use to be imposed by people people rotated in office they didn't serve for\nThirty thirty five years in Congress or in the Senate\nAnd so we didn't need term limits now we do need term was when the founders created the Supreme Court for example the Supreme Court\nThe justices average age of appointment was forty seven average life expectancy was fifty four they didn't expect jurors to serve Thirty years on the United States Supreme court so we've broken the system in some pretty fundamental ways that need to be repaired structurally those things aren't going to be repaired by elections\nWhat about the process by which we have amended their constitutions numerous times throughout the centuries starting with the bill of rights where are you going minute by minute is that just to laborious process to try to get this type of systemic change that you're talking about\nI don't think it's that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is\nIs that it's so much more laborious the issue is what we're looking at is controlling the federal government if you look at the process\nThe the other process we're proposing amendments and members have to be proposed by Congress but we are talking about is Congress needs its wings clipped Congress needs balanced budget imposed on it Congress needs term limits imposed on it they will never propose those sorts of evidence they would take two thirds of both houses to propose it\nTry to imagine a time when two thirds of both houses of Congress propose a balanced budget amendment term limits that's just not going to happen\nThey have even been able to balance the budget and the lifestyle of decades let alone propose it so we need this convention in states in order to bring about this type of change that is necessary at this point in our history mark one concern that has raised the as we do have is I mentioned earlier that bill of rights and there is a concern that a convention\nOf states could go rogue and maybe erodes some of the God given rights that are protected by the constitution how you protect against that\nWell first of all the convention is called according to resolutions passed by the states all states have to pass the same resolutions those resolutions preclude any discussion frankly have anything in the bill of rights they literally cannot even be discussed\nWhen you get in convention all the delegations are controlled by the states that sent them to states limit what they can and can't talk about\nToday we need to remember there are thirty three states with both houses controlled by Republicans every delegate comes is controlled by their legislature so if they even started to try to get out of bounds they could be stopped by their states and ultimately the founders provided the protection which was it takes three quarters of all states are thirty eight states to ratify anything\nYou can do the math I run the math on every single women ever been proposed to me you can't find it amendment that would limit our liberties that could be ratified it even close to thirty eight states\nLet's talk a little bit more about process you touched upon it earlier and the number of states that is needed tell us how many we have you've mentioned how many we need and where do we stand in the process of getting to the critical mass that would allow this convention of states to occur\nAre so it takes thirty four states are two thirds of the states to call a convention so far twelve states have done that so we're just over one third of the way there which is extraordinary people said it was impossible to get that far we've gotten that far already\nWas seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that is the largest\nFederal budget deficit in a single year since twenty ... well that's right the first term of the Obama administration I've ... band with reason magazine thanks for joining us on this edition of American radio journal my guest today is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and he's also a long time Republican congressional aide he worked with Senator Rob Portman of Ohio\nFor years and he also crafted the deficit reduction plan\nMore than twenty twelve Romney campaigns O'Brian has been thinking about and writing about and talking about budget in budget deficits for a long time and we appreciate him stopping by the show Brian thanks for being here\nThank you the budget deficit for the year that ended on September thirtieth Brian seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that the largest twenty twelve break these numbers down for is what's driving that big deficit increase that we saw over the last twelve months\nThe interesting thing about the opposite of that is rising during a time of economic prosperity which you don't see in the last couple of years have gone from four hundred and thirty nine billion all the way to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion\nRise of the deficit in the past year is mostly to the tax cuts which cost about a hundred and sixty four billion dollars if you include the interest\nAnd the big spending half the over they raise the spending Africa and and the discretionary spending that was about a hundred and forty six billion without those two policies that would have been closer to four hundred and fifty million they push it up to seven Seventy nine\nI just had rhyme we don't usually see big jumps in the deficit during times of of relative peace and prosperity we're on course right now for a deficit will exceed a trillion dollars by the end of the current fiscal year the twenty Nineteen fiscal year so this problem is not going away in fact it's only getting bigger\nCompare what's happening right now for the federal budget to where we were saying in twenty can through twenty twelve\nThose years where we were we had that deficit up around a trillion dollars even just over a trillion dollars how is it different now versus that\nWe've had that one point four trillion dollars which brought a lot of deficit hysteria around the country and a lot of concerns that the party\nThe difference is that was one point four trillion dollar deficits temporary revolt a very the profession and when the recession went away the deficit down mostly by itself a Congress that a little bit of tax hikes a little bit of spending cuts the stimulus spending ended\nAnd it dropped by the difference now is that moving forward the out of it is primarily going to be the result of Social Security and Medicare Seventy four million retiree baby boomers and rising healthcare costs\nThat's not temporary that's not going away as a matter of fact years under current policy baseline but if current trends continue we're looking at a deficit of really in a year or even three trillion interest rates rise\nAnd about eighty percent of that deficit will be from Social Security and Medicare\nSo you have a kind of a combination of factors working here you've got the short term factors the tax cuts\nThe spending hikes then you've got the long term factors those entitlement costs that you talked about\nWe're talking with Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and he's the author of a paper that is just out this week Bryan we should plug this is titled comprehensive budget plan to emerge a debt crisis you can find that at the Manhattan Institute website Manhattan Institute dot org and Brian Reed all is the author of that piece that looks at a not so much\nThe deficit that we're facing today but really the quite scary numbers that we're going to be facing and five or ten years if\nPolicymakers in DC don't get serious about dealing with is Brian tell us a little bit about what that sort of physical sue nominee than in the news coming for us in the next ten years if we don't sit up and look at this trillion dollar deficit and and do something about that I\nMean numbers are staggering over the long term effect is to put it in the works because it almost sounds like monopoly money when you say the national debt right now with twenty million dollars over the next Thirty years Social Security and Medicare is a shortfall of one hundred trillion dollars\nIncluding interest over Thirty years the numbers are too big to even imagine so when it really means is that in order to pay out promised benefits for Social Security and Medicare we would have to double tax rates\nDouble corporate tax rate double your family's tax rates double the payroll tax you send to Washington would have to double check to pay for the programs we've already we're not even into account the Bernie Sanders for a trillion dollars agenda this is doubling taxes to pay for the benefit that we probably\nThere are a lot of details in the paper here Brian and I would encourage our listeners to check out the longer version of this interview that we have running it reason dot com right now but\nThat you can get all the details there you can read the paper invited their opinion about the minute or so we have left here Brian what is the basic formula here to avoid this coming debt crisis that America to be facing in the next day the next decade or so\nWe need a Congress to actually come together on a grand plan mostly entitlement spending but actors have to be on the table to planned to avert a debt crisis we have the policies take effect is twenty twenty three\nSo she grew up with that we got to get people to the people starting to go shooting the stop start enacting it and get it implemented because for longer we wait the cost of her former writer by trillions\nSo the problem isn't going away is it time to address these high on the program and yes probably ... ... if I'm able to\nSay really really big problem it could mean a as Brian said it it could mean the doubling of all the taxes that you currently paid in the federal government just to pay the existing debt in the system as a big problem we're not going to solve it unless we start talking about it but at least we've got people like Brian Reed all out there who are talking about it right thanks for taking some time to be here on the show thank you\nAnd again that is Brian Reed all he is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute former Republican policy wonk on the hill as well you can check out his

area of western Pennsylvania I'm here referring to local DSM members summer Lee and Sarah in Morocco who are on their way to the state houses elected socialists\nAnd um or auto who are on their way to the state houses elected socialists actually formally elected Democrats the same is true in the national scale for the elected Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nLook up the Democrats change their skins as they head out of the urban areas into more conservative districts look at the challengers to too conservative Republican congressman two men of genuine conservative principles Michaeleen Keith Rothfus those two are being challenged by Ron didn't Nicholas and Conor Lamb\nThose races plus the DSM III races of Lee and then him or auto show with political Panthers these

socialist like Ocasio Cortez and summer Lee and Sarah in them or auto and they're super liberal city districts in between they nab candidates like Kerri Evelyn Harris in my ear Cheryl I asked the Democratic party have you know principals\nActually they do while the one overriding principal or I should say purpose to win and secure power and then above all they hoped to achieve the added purpose of impeaching Donald Trump\nBut the visual is also a dangerous thing\nI was in the city of course I'm a little\n... name it's not far from the city of coaching if anyone here from Canada you know where that is\nThe reason is a historic cities because that is reputed to be the place where the apostle Thomas actually arrived in India in eighty fifty two fifty three something like a lot of historical evidence many historic notations that he actually came there\nAnd I've got books and books and the words of material that I picked up there to show who referred to the apostles Thomas coming there but through some conversations they're my colleague myself and whoever took us there were taken into the inner sank down\nThe ... thank them as an older where it's a huge crank we like

heart about down and show that to you that they tell you is a piece of the radio bone from the floor arm of the apostle Thomas [noise]\nI said I get it [noise]\n\nShe said after his buddy was taken back to Rome more recent times the pope sent a piece of that bone and now it's here on the loss for us\nTo look and see and revere so on I Wonder if Thomas regrets having ever said on this site and look and touch and feel myself I myself will not believe [noise]\nYou know the real when the very gospel that tells the story of Thomas tells us these things are written these things are written\nThat you might know that you have the turn of life proposition of truth former enduring than visual and so they hold out and form to the visual\nAnd let me just say to more here the last Center for cultural molding there's no center left to mold culture it moved from institutions institutions to institutions no one place most all of culture now maybe if any place does is the entertainment media\nWhich legitimize this things and modernize us taste so that we can all sit down and talk about the same show in the same idle the next day that's the way it goes and the last one is\nThe shifting power to a yellow world\nWe must come to terms with is the world of entertainment and the world of sports principally one said latches onto the young minds there's a big industry and and there's big bucks and there's big money\nIn it young guys coming out at the age of Twenty one and twenty two can be signing ten million dollar contracts the buying power the emerging power the I don't trust power all of that comes along with it and so it's shifting power to a young world\nThese changes have taken place over the last century number one it is going to take unapologetic from us that is not just heard but it's also seen\nApologetic that is not merely heard about it is also seen have your life has not demonstrating what you are propagating it'll all be something that stays in the rational sticks centers it'll never ever come down to the ... of the existential there's no way to actually tested\nThat apologetic that is not only heard but is also seen the visual living out of the Christian life\nIs imperative for the times in which we live if a person cannot see a conversion story they will question at all the days of the last question it\nAnd I think it is a very critical thing number two he does unapologetic that has not merely argued but there's also felt unapologetic that has not merely argued but it's also helped\nThe argument factor is critical but the felt factor is the tail end of that argument he must feel the gospel\nThat me give you two quick illustrations of this and moved to my final taught been sharing this the last couple of days because it's so fresh in my mind\nAnd it is this I'm writing another book and I just finished my first chapter in which I talked about who is Jesus Christ and I took it from his own words\nThe son of man the son of God the son of David and all of that and built into how exactly those talks were meant to be seen in the day in which he communicated them\nBut I knew everywhere I go that there's a real\nPassion to have answers to some things especially in the Islamic world the argument for the doctrine of the trinity we try and try and try and they're always responding with how can this be how can this me now obviously there's a transcending reality here that is beyond the human mind\nBut I was in Delhi writing that chapter and I remember very clearly having been on my knees and I said lord\nGave me some kind of a handle on this so I can communicate and some metaphorical way to the audience how do we give analogy for something like this\nSo I prayed and off guard and it may not be of any help too because any analogy any metaphor will always fall short just like any parable will always fall short and you cannot Bush every parable to its ultimate details\nBut I remember getting all money's going out the window looking out and this\nComes into my mind at the moment of consternation when a husband and wife have gone she made to their love in that sacredness of act as marriage\nIn that moment of conception takes place in the mother's womb in an incredible way that mother bearing the child actually has\nThree DNA is within her at that time\nThere is her DNA there is the husbands DNA and there is a new life that at that point is not even known to her in effect you got three persons in the presence of that body\nIn the presence of that body\nWith the one being who's got the three persons represented\nIn that big now we may ride down some scientific explanations saying we understand is doing\nMy work if not finished you we know and if one wants to argue away from that you just stick them mother set of twins in her at that time\nWe have got to completely distinct lives from her pray to God to stream\nIn that one is being even are finished you we have such Supreme mystery by virtue of their head but I have a much more\nCan it be possible and the Trump sending infant and being of one essence in three persons with the tree\nBecoming what that tells me that ultimately argument will take you to all kinds of directions but what the world hunger for is a relationship and that relationship or wisdom parks feeling in to life\nAnd so when you're making arguments what other arguments you again\nRemember ultimately we are feeling entities we are thinking entities\nAnd so we go beyond the argument to the feeling and that's why it's so important to share the feelings of the questioner not just the questions of the questioner Sean apologetic that is not just heard but seen not just argue but failed and lastly an approach that rescues not only the ... to reach them for God\nBut the means as well what is the means\nThe means art ultimately to be the word of God to the Holy Spirit to God\nThe moment you think we can become apologist that changed lives you're on the wrong track\nThe moment you know that this was God's business of changing lives are merely the instrument you\nWill celebrate the privilege of being a defender of the day because ultimately God is the lion has John Calvin said that you let loose from the cage and he defends himself\nYou know I can close with some illustrations let me close with two I remember my younger days this might sound like a poor me story but it's not in those days you got into your car and you drill\nActually I think we have a better for it now we just do it because of the fog we can't go anywhere\nBut in the car you got it our number my wife and I freshly married and my mom had given us a nice little car and so I did every all the way I Lived in Toronto eastern western Canada Dr and drive and Dr thousands of miles a year and I remember coming into this little town in New Brunswick\nAnd reverse staying home state and the home for a week and you know right from the early I don't know what it was whether I looked like an ideal candidate a punishment or what but everybody would invite all of the toughest resistant friends to have dinner with me that night [noise]\nWhich basically meant I wouldn't eat and they would eat and I would answer questions so whenever anybody invites me for dinner I always say who's going to be there [noise]\nGood easy to lose weight and those kinds of situations but conduit for
