said er during the event Donald Trump's been very very good for baseball he's been wonderful for the industry okay\nI'm Koppel told seltzer\nOr just any reference CNN president Jeff Zucker your boss acknowledge those months a couple of your boss acknowledged as much a number of months ago during the campaign\nThe ratings are up it means you can't do without Donald Trump absolutely you would be lost with Donald Trump seltzer objected quote that is Ted you know that's not true\nAnd then Ted Koppel said hold on just a second CNN's ratings would be in the toilet without Donald Trump\nAbsolutely maybe watching much anything really I'm more we'd be watching the weather channel this is off of a bright bark a column I'm On hold them and get the the the writer that's true that's true vote so ah just cut loose so every day the ... to throw at them and\nThe to continue to go back and forth shelter said that the ratings going up or down don't necessarily matter\nA settlement clearly at odds with Jeff Zucker is past comments in a recent undercover video whereas CNN producer so the network is over playing the mostly bowl blank I don't know how to keep it clean far left Russia collusion conspiracy just for ratings\nYeah I'd have something to talk about that the liberals reds night when the breaking news breaking news everyday breaking news prompted this it's not news coverage of of um\nOf Trump previously led to ratings wins for CNN it has not been able to keep the numbers up\nI'm Talking about how uh so it's so see this is also from Jason Caruso from last week CNN ratings last week continues to disappoint even with the massive breaking news event of Hurricane Florence okay\nI'm so again\nLeadership locally is some muscles called that there's two things one local in one's national national has big local implications\nThat I feel like the business leadership again you guys can correct me anytime you want\nSeven nine zero twenty forty wake up Tucson a Gmail dot com or you can hit me at um waste the book I Christopher decent up\nBut this is what I have for you the local issue and I won't bore labor too much that I cannot believe local southern Arizona leadership\nTucson metro chamber Hispanic Chamber green shaver\nElegy Beatty chamber any chamber\nBut says there are business advocacy group has said nothing about the crime levels in Tucson\nAnd lack of policing nothing now add\nYou get a zillion press releases a day mhm urine news reader kind of guy mhm you hang out with other news ask people am I have you seen anything from any\nGroup into some\nSaying God we're a little concerned about the policing and we're when police shortage et cetera et cetera right in our we're really concerned that our businesses are under siege have you seen anything like\nThat no there might have been released a week or so ago about something about crime from somebody made a comment but not I don't know if\nThere's a fish so one not real so we've told you all the stories the stars told you that the stories right\nMeaning neat though Rob midday right the guy comes in and tries to grab the cash register well people are eating lunch\nThen someone did they stabbed the guy is that what they did they try to one of the people that try something is that he stabbed him I got that\nUm or east coast Chihuahua sound and her son ... sunrise and swam this spring ripped off a at lunchtime on a Saturday daytime\nThis isn't like sneaking around at three o'clock in the morning these are patrons in the restaurant psycho comes in drug bad guy or whatever and just thinks he can Rob the place there's another restaurant I'm missing here too\nSo I keep hearing anyone I Know that has a retail shop within the city limits of Tucson\nAll they do is keep for defying it's like they're spending more money than they need to turning their business in the Fort Knox so sooner or later here's the best memory and you're you're back east guy right when you go to certain downtowns here in Manhattan the Philly right\nYou got those places that they have the iron bars on their bill on their on their ... window right and\nThe the iron curtain is the right on the line\nWhen did we get to their right\nI'm sure it's against the H always right if if some business who got Rob seven times decided to put bars all over the last I'm sure some the west university neighborhood association would come sue them for ruining the aesthetic of the neighbor\nSo okay so that's number one none of these people ever mention and I'm thinking well get Leah right at the Hispanic Chamber here's an easy one to come out while you're running for Congress\nAnd say look I'm a leader look at this ... do you think you might win a few votes from some business owners or say hey she's the only one talking about the cops she's the only one empathizing with me but I'm under siege in my business so that's number one number two here's a national thing\nHow many people\nAs Trump started moving through here\nAny trapped on NAFTA right\nIt's the worst deal in history it's the worst deal in history\nNo other presidents talked about even your beloved Morocco Obama kids out there or is it has been on record saying oh the though that's something I've talked to Joe about and we've got\nWe've got to get that renegotiated right on humor to daycare so here's Trump so remember\n\nWhen that discussion first came up\nAbout NAFTA\nHow many stories did you see in the news and how many leaders\nSaid we're so concerned Mexico's our biggest trading partner right\nAbsolutely I bet you so you do it I bet she was one of the ones that you really I think she was on the show talking about so we use one we have new chamber ship\nChamber membership a leadership sense that the first thing was saying okay\nAnd then I'm sure they got some you know Richard ... one of these clowns on on tape going oh I Can't believe Trump's doing this\nHe is how many stories did you see about him threatening this important relationship we have with Mexico\nBut now that there's a deal\nThat both Mexico and Canada have pretty much signed off on and we still got to get our back in approval and all that jazz but I have three countries that have now including our biggest trading partner in Arizona called Mexico\nHave improved have proved NAFTA enter and in all three sides are on it right absolutely us em a seat right\nAd back to you again you're my news guy and doing all this stuff how many stories or leaders did you come out\nSaying either we are satisfied relieved happy that there's a new deal\nOn NAFTA Mm oh what would you just found for me\nWhat was your just wrong for me\nWhere to go out on winter okay [noise] oh so you're on it or what okay All right\nI think I I

coincidence\nIt's a fun coincidence now the other part of this is so I so I I went to the U.S I'm looking for stories from anyone down here even talking about this so it takes the uh it's\nThis is in the Arizona daily independent but this is actually from the Cronkite news service kids at an issue right\nAnd it says um\nArizona economic groups cheer deal between us and Mexico and Canada so number
