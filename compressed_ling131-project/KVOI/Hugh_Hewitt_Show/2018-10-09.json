In part because of the timing of the the interview with Juanita Broderick on a on NBC when that actually aired\nUm and I think there was a sense from the media was coming on the heels of impeachment and this this this whole category of Clinton's life had just been litigated to it never\nFully exploded but one of the one of the things Democrats were saying back then\nWas essentially that they were treating it as um [noise] well hey the Republicans you know I've been trying to take down Bill Clinton since he became president you know Hillary Clinton had that term vast right wing conspiracy and\nThey tried with whitewater and and ah ... it'll be Ken Starr and Monica Lewinsky and it is just the latest in a line of sort of increasingly desperate things Democrats or Republicans have resorted to\nTo try to take down Bill Clinton it was viewed in that context and and it's it's it's language I I've seen on the other side in relation to to Ford and cabinet and there's no last week\nNo yeah it it will resonate with everyone on every level but let's dig into the nineties I think probably the seminal moment is not the election of Bill Clinton do that is for history but for politics it's the counter revolution in Nineteen Ninety four\nI was live on PBS in LA I hosted the local PBS show with Patt Morrison kind of medics when we went live on Nineteen Ninety four I can remember clues about if it was a fight they stop it it was such a traumatic event for the Democrats fifty two house seats lost nine Senate seats you know Richard Shelby switched parties immediately after\nWhat made the carnage even worse I don't know that twenty ten or twenty fourteen whereas traumatic to the political system is Nineteen Ninety four what do you think the ...\nI I completely agree and one of the reasons twenty ten and twenty fourteen weren't as traumatic with because we'd been through Nineteen Ninety four and and I had to put it in\nPerspective for folks who who who weren't following it back then or maybe a forgotten a little bit I mean it had been forty years in Nineteen Ninety four since Republicans had control the house\nAnd they hadn't even been close you know we've got a midterm coming up right now we're Democrats are again of twenty three seats away it's it it may it may not happen but it's doable for them and and it seems like every election we go into these days it's it's conceivable that control the house could switch\nUm it was inconceivable for decades in American politics from the fifties in the Nineteen nineties the Republicans would control the house it was known as a permanent Democratic Congress the speaker's gavel was was handed down almost like a hereditary tool\nUm from one democratic speaker to another Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority\nIn the minority excuse me and it was an expectation heading into Nineteen Ninety four that it would be a good year for Republicans you know the Clinton presidency had been very rocky his approval rating\nWas pretty low but the thought going into election night Ninety four with a a good night Republicans will pick up the Senate and make a dent in the house\nUm when the return started coming in I mean things started happening that night like a speaker of the house Tom Foley lost re election in his home district that hadn't happened since the civil war\nOr Dan Rostenkowski this just sort of old bowl chair of the ways and Means Committee he'd been um he was later you know prosecuted but I'm a Dan Rostenkowski lost his seat in Chicago I mean this is this is like this is a district that was like forty points democratic and Dan Rostenkowski loses his seat there Mario Cuomo who is the\nThe um one of the most famous or delivered liberals in the country in Nineteen eighty four loses in New York state I'm just happening all over the math and and to go back and and relive the the the way this was regarded in the moment and Newt Gingrich of course become speaker of the house this was this was also unsinkable in politics\nBecause he'd been a a ... into his own party even an irritant just a few years earlier um but it was there were serious discussions of\nIn the media in the wake of that election that not only was Bill Clinton finished that was taken as a given but that the Democratic party and liberalism itself where we're headed for in immediate extinction\nIt was also the first media shock now I have often told people if the media had a concussion protocol we'd all still beginning after twenty sixteen you and I were together on election night twenty sixteen but the shock of Nineteen Ninety four was as great\nIt was like Nineteen eighty and it doesn't occur very often and you read describe it for our millennials out they're going to be fascinated by the way Steve ... back in the red and blue\nPeople who are still on the front page like Nancy Pelosi are playing very large rules I Want to cook from page three sixty nine where a speaker\nOf former Speaker Pelosi at that time just the leading Democrat was commenting on Monica Lewinsky uh I don't think it happened but if it did it comes to the big surprise I don't think that for one moment there's an atmosphere of sexual harassment and the White House\nI read that because you're not easy on anyone here just telling the story you because I Want my conservative audience understand the connecting plays this right down the middle and the right of the blue you're not this is not an advocacy book this is a narrative of a a multi decade\nI that exist thank you were saying that because that's exactly what I Would I aim to do here I'm In I'm just trying to explain how we ended up the goal with the book\nUm is to use as sort of the endpoint election night two thousand and it's the closest thing to a perfect time we've ever seen in a presidential election in this country comes down to\nIt was five or thirty seven votes in Florida the Supreme Court ruling the recount and all of that\nAnd I think that division that map that just almost perfect split down in the middle of the country I think it's the product of of all of the political battles and political wars of the Nineteen nineties that it just took Americans in and made them choose sides Democrat or Republican\nUm and and I think each party and its own way contributed to it the way it the way it responded to the other party the way a played off the other party the way it unintentionally reinforced with their party was trying to do um you know I write about\nA one aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his style of politics and the house which of course culminated in his his grandest our that that night in Nineteen Ninety four when he becomes speaker and one of the things you see I I think that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long rise of Newt Gingrich in the house\nUm he is absolutely changing a lot of the norms and traditions and and blowing them up and and embracing a much more combative style\nBut the Democrats who the prominent Democratic majority as it was known back at that time they played right into his hand and they ended up pushing up through the way it's a particularly house speaker Jim Wright is a guy from the late Nineteen eighties particularly the way he ran the house\nIt pushed Republican moderates into Newt Gingrich's camp and it left the moderates saying you know what we're getting nowhere with the leadership we've been following it for three decades let's give this guy new to try\nBob Michel a great gentleman but not a change agent like new I Love the fact quote the first thing they did was stick at the Harvard on page tonight or do you know Seventy

it and astonished to say it said especially since the president bought mocked Christine Blasey Ford and an ugly and gratuitous later rally Tuesday\nPerhaps it's worth unpacking this admission for those who might be equally astonished to read it\nI Am grateful because Trump has not backed down in the face of slippery miss hypocrisy and dangerous standard setting deployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\nI'm grateful will just do it next segment or I'm grateful because Trump has not backed down and the other I just read that the I'm grateful because these

razor sharp dagger a few moments crystallized my views over\nThe past few days the\nFirst remark came from a friend I'd rather be accused of murder them sexual assaults he said I feel the same way one can think of excuses for killing a man known for assaulting a woman but if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault\nIs nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself\nIn inflict psychic familial reputational and professional harms that can last a lifetime this has nothing to smear\nThe second moment connected to the first boo hoo hoo Brett Kavanaugh was not a victim that was the title of the column in the LA Times which suggested the possibility of Kavanaugh's incident or innocence was infant and has some old really small a\nYet false allegations of rape while relatively rare or at least five times comment as false accusations of other crimes according to academic literature since when did the possibility of an innocence for today's liberals is something the wave off with the Archie artfully unfeeling boo hoo\nThe third movement connected to the second was listening to Cory Booker senator from New Jersey explain that ultimately he doesn't it doesn't matter if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent because enough questions have been raised that it was time to move on to the next\nCandidate this is a rhetorical sleight of hand in three acts or the\nOne question that really matters raise the secondary set of questions that are holding the result of the question you decided to ignore call for another candidate because it'll push confirmation hearings

parties\nDecades earlier where women were gang raped changed the details of her story in our interview with NBC News her claims bordered on preposterous they're totally uncorroborated but that didn't keep Kevin also Pullman Conan in the politics and the press from seizing them as corroborate shouldn't have blamed these allegations\nWhich is not preposterous but also largely uncorroborated with the allegation that Kavanaugh's ... classmate Deborah Ramirez uncorroborated again\nUncorroborated plus uncorroborated plus largely uncorroborated is not an accumulation of questions much less evidence\nIt's the duplication of here say that's a great line right there I Know it ...\nUncorroborated plus uncorroborated was largely uncorroborated is ... is not the accumulation of questions much less of evidence\nIt's duplication of hearsay which we can say about the news right that we talk about the news right now right we have the Washington Post this is ... talking now does the story based
