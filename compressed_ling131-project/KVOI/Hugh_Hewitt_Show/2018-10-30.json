this I I Am excited\nThey have someone like you running for Congress because we need serious people who are experience with China but does it resonate at the local level we're in the middle of the strangest political environment I've ever seen with pipe bomb guys and a a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh\nAnd people saying crazy stuff on cable TV twenty four seven\nYou know people look at it Dan David who is a smart experience\nObviously prepared candidate and listen to you or do they want to talk about crazy stuff what do you run into\nA too much of the ladder ah I I'm I'm working at heart and that's why I'm doing the town halls\nAnd I end up seeing Democrats or Republicans and independents because having a seat means you represent all people and and that's a very gratifying I Wish I had more time a ... and it's very expensive you know like Fifteen to twenty million dollars to run for contested seat and this is\nJerry stretch to their airways of Philadelphia but yeah it gets crazy or and and and nobody's really right on the far right and nobody's really right on the far left there so far out there well we need is is more in the center\nMore compromise with fellow Americans that they want to push our country forward and understand that that our enemies are abroad and and that we're not enemies were just people that need to sit down and get it worked out you know at least looked at the things we agree on\nA manly and David but when you go out and do town hall if you've done fifteenth I'm Talking with by the way America just tuned in especially W. A. T. P.\nIn Philadelphia and talking with Dan David he's running for an open seat ... Pennsylvania fourth congressional district is going to be one of the bellwether seats I'm watching a week from today at night to see if it goes to Dan David I think if it does the Republicans mind on the house\nThat's why a damn David on it's it's not because I'm hyper local but because he represents a much broader thing when you go to the town halls and obviously you're gonna get a mix\nPeople put up their hands are they coherent because I see so much spit all coming out of ... like Marsha Blackburn last night during a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh some crazy woman started yelling that Marsha Blackburn was a white supremacist\nYeah my my my town halls have been extremely civil or I'd had very very few instances where\nUh people have got up angry and one or two and we we were able to comment write down and under state law saying look if you're just here to grandstand than say your piece in leave if you want to have a logical conversation and work something out for the rest of the country then then we'll have a conversation and it's been able to\nCalm down but I've seen some of the stuff that goes on on television that's not what I've experienced and what I Do it's just it you know I I remind the person you're making this about you you're not making this about the country and I don't have time for that crap\nAnd when I Do it's just it you know I I remind the person you're making this about you you're not making this about the country and I don't have time for that crap\nThat that that's excellent that by the way that that that's a playbook for other candidates because\nI think my business not talk radio exclusively but all of media is poisoning politics because they're not talking about issues\nThey're talking about stuff like four bullets fired into the ... county Republican headquarters they're talking about the pipe bomb I mean these are stories but it's not like Congress is supposed to do you're supposed to go and figure out how to stop China for ripping us off\nYou'll we're supposed to supposed to have the kind of education and background in the diversity I mean look the oldest he's found out in Congress of course I Want more diversity in Congress we need more women and we need more minorities and I'm I I think that's that's great but we need more occupational diversity with forty three percent of our members of Congress are lawyers\nNothing wrong with that there is a great forty three percent of the entire body we need more business people down there and we need more occupational diversity ... understand\nA finance economics global warfare I have a deep understanding of the middle east and ah the tribal values there and how we've screwed that up over the last Twenty years\nAnd Israel or my opponent ... doesn't understand any of that quite frankly\nThe David that is bad so refreshing so I Will keep falling on the race I'll tell everyone is early voting on her way by the way this Pennsylvania early voting\nNo we have absentee ballot voting so we don't have any results coming in or we should see that\nUh it it it Shavers as far as like asking for the ballots probably shifty two fifty three percent for seven Democrats or Republicans but it's all about to turn out\nAnd do you feel pretty good at this point last question how does it feel to it\nA while and I mean my fourth call has us a dead even a ... you know maybe me waiting a little bit but it's about getting information out regarding my opponent shot China business and you know making millions up paying people to twenty an hour asking everybody here to pay Fifteen an hour\nAnd the ... yeah and the British Virgin islands chat said and what she has most of our money literally what's her name is ... ... ... ... what you said she wants to repeal
