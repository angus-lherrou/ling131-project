a I don't know what to say about her testimony I was overly impressed by off half say women who have have a\nVery different experiences in response to quit I so it's really hard\nI Believe probably something happened to her but more importantly I'm a product Kavanaugh's proven guilty she is now with all\nDue processes right ... thank you for the call and due process is understood intuitively by Americans\nKnow and and and that's why I think this is a I I'm I'm actually very hard to advise us um and and their reactions show that those those core principles of\nOf western civilization for God's sake or are still there this is this is very good at it and they've seen that due process I mean what does this guy is innocent until proven guilty of the opposite\nUh it just before them and they're seeing it through these comments people are reading this day by day they're putting it together and they're coming to this conclusion it's it's a it's an amazing thing this this reaction\nKelly in New York state Kelly around with Dr Matthew small they're going to hear your church should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nYes why I in Syria\nThat we are in Asian and he had his father had been\nRather than I Want to let every American women now that the Democrats are hunting for that they can be completely innocent and all they have to say one thing or make one incorrect I\nSay one other one politically incorrect statements just be just like\nA conservative temperament or you as the world and not that\nOne on and that's that is a new ... and ... that will pay the cabin in your life that will be the cabinet standard\nAnd I'm ... calling people are not aware of that they're aware of the new standard dream forced upon the process here\nNo I I I think they're picking it up and and this is a ... you know so this particular cases brought it out but\nThe same to remember here is that\nThe the logic of this is is not something new this just didn't pop up after twenty sixteen and because of this particular case this is\nThis is really the really the the logic of kind of post modern liberalism goes it's this is identity politics this is what I meant by the academy comes to Washington it\nDoesn't matter whether the rule of law is upheld it doesn't matter what he's innocent until proven guilty it's all about identity politics and how he's defined than that and he's on the outside this is this is more like North Korea right he's violated the\nPrinciples that deep principles of the of the party and so therefore we have to have find him guilty while the trial later maybe this is Alice in wonderland I don't know but but there's a clear this jumped here that\nSome it becomes obvious in a peculiar circumstance this is this is a a wonderful example of how we talk with the principles of the overarching in every once in a while the circumstances just make that patently obvious\nAnd murder in our Roberta in Philadelphia should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nYes that I had a different perspective I'd like to tell you I attend the Temple University senior program there's hundreds and hundreds of people that go every class when I go into the\nNearest snide remarks and the teachers and the fellow students and you had a self selected audience and we call him because we care and the other people do not get this message they get their messages than others so I say CNN MSNBC ABC CBS whatever\nThat that is true absolutely but ... I Believe and I I I Know this nearing liberals don't believe in the talk radio audience\nThis is not pre screened we do not care of people are against cabinet or they don't want to believe and so when you got I've got no thirty plus color is it's not pre screened you can't make this up\nNo I I think that's right I I go back to my example of of of the cab you're right I just I I think we ... what is a an amazing here is that\nThis is a moment where the people are engaged in a way they've not been on a lot of things they're looking at the lens of their own background their own lives their own families and there's so much information out there kept having so quickly it's hard to filter it there's just so much and they're\nPicking up on this argument I think that tells you something about the the general health of the American public which I think is good we're we're still divided by all means is is it a bit much divided country\nBut a lot of people who hear two former we thought were only lightly engaged not interested in politics or they\nSee this that that strikes me is a very powerful statement about the the uh the human ... but also about the permanent strength of of the

I'm Sorry it's just more manipulation absolutely more than ...\nAnd you know these people that are out there protesting Kevin uh a lot of the majority of them in my opinion are\nPoorly educated easily manipulated\nAnd or the Democrats have figured this out over the last thirty forty years so they poorly educate our kids and here's the result\nAgain what happens is when you don't have the facts on your side you scream a lot poorly educated that's ...\nSo let's do that I don't know what happened to Lindsey Graham\nLindsey has had good moments he's had interesting moments\nBut all of a sudden in this process that his his\nFive minutes or whatever you had at the at the Judiciary Committee to Thursdays ago I said ... he's he's had enough right you know oh back to the the demeanor of judge Kavanaugh\nRight 'cause that's the other thing they're heading I'm On\nThis is mass character assassination\nAnd he's not supposed to react\nThat's what they want supposedly now that he's just sat there but now\nWait a minute Chris let's take this\nScenario in that direction yeah so he stone stone faced the whole thing right what do you think Feinstein and uh he must be hiding something yeah\n[laughter] so I ended up hanging up that you know with a black brush so you know so\nWhen you're sitting there and you have MSNBC CNN\nRight the ... most of the major networks\nAnd all of these people and all of these senators and Congress people oh and it's in the middle of the election season so\nHalf these campaign commercials they're trying to make their points right that judge Kavanaugh is that these these quote three women came there is no corroborating evidence there is no corroborating witnesses there's no there's no evidence and the people who are witnesses there say they didn't happen\nTo the three turned out to be complete wackos\nRight that third one ... yeah oh my lord\nApparently she spent most of her college days in a stupor\nAn alcoholic stupor some people have done that [laughter] so anyways so\nLindsey Graham is walking down the hallway worries that he's got a brick wall behind them\nAnd uh he might be outside and he has this classic line\nThat is exactly from uh this is\nBill just remember or may have a little place called Salem, Massachusetts so\nDr Fairbanks let's do it\nYou know we go it's going to happen\n[noise] ah having a little impromptu road tests are yelling at him [noise]\nA bottom corner when young in Hawaii or see that's a line by line we're\nThis is a bottom well why don't we don't want her to see why that's why a lot on line here\nNo Democrats exam one maybe two or none of her cat [noise]\nMost all Democrats had made up their minds\nAround us says well the goal here is delayed ignorance estimate term so we can fill the seat\nShe was foolish enough to say that er we smart enough to believer and I actually do believe that what you do that and go at least not about the [noise]\nHitting sell for mental background check consistent literary class to three senators\nTo add to the hundred and forty six [noise]\nIt will never be enough if you don't believe in the gang races\nWe don't believe he's establishing some link draw\nSerial sexual predator maybe a little ... about how much he drank and high school they do I send a party sees me in a bar\nWhere he doesn't have the temperament and then he didn't handle man destroy well [noise]\nI Know I Know\nSo that's the two the two lines are that that I Love in this interview or outside the hallway here is uh why don't we don't come in water and see if he wants but\nI used to do in a friend or wherever that's the great line right there and we used to have to you know now and and now I'm going to start one uh playing the or the ... this this doesn't have to be the Senate's inquisition right well\nA and then this is actually that I Know that was the wind that first attracted me right why don't we don't give them in water and see if we floats the second line really and this goes but what you and I were just talking about\nIs so what are you so the so he ... he doesn't have the demeanor or the temperament and Graham puts it perfectly here so what you're saying is he didn't handle being destroyed well enough [laughter] [noise]\nThat is a money Lyme\nKavanaugh for the Democrats didn't\nHandle being destroyed well enough you know something that's a great one so let's just throw 'em on time don't worry about seven nine zero twenty forty let's go to bill in line to build shaken\nGood morning and yeah\nThere there's prime your brain just locks up from the uh the logic that keeps coming at you almost on a minute by minute basis with everything that's been happening with having a and and that that you know an average human mind just kind of\nA two thousand fourteen and sleep you use in two thousand six team it was much too too much too fast\nNow the money on line and bill is totally correct I Love this line there are now more places to buy a mattress in the United states than places to buy a Big Mac\nSo for all of you who were like why are there are three mattress stores on the same quarter now especially since there's so much of that now being bought\nOn line right why now there'll be only two mattress stores on the corner instead of three so now you can go to thirty will be fine\nAh money python and the holy grail I've had now nine of you message me about this thing\nBecause we just had Lindsey Graham's talk about Brett Kavanaugh shooting down this heckler while he's trying to do a quick little a little interview in the hallway saying why don't we don't come\nAnd see if we floats talking about Brett Kavanaugh of course referring to a witch hunt now I have seen the scene as billion times\nThe only thing you cannot play is at the end but I'll tell you went All right it's like the last word do we can't play on the air or be ready for your dump button\nIs what I'll tell you well we can stop it in any point\nCorrect I'm just giving
