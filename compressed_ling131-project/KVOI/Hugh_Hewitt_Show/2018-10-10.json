it's news to us\nNow this guy ... did not do a very good job talking about in her Patrick choking it last night okay now let me give you an example of anchor Patrick and her entire staff choking it last night or right here we go\nShe kept on saying well you know Paul Ryan came and did a mining raising fish you know for her and that means she's going to be a Paul Paul Ryan or if she gets in she'll be a Paul Ryan buffet\nWith Paul Ryan runs he wants to four times and I don't know but it it it's a little bit if Paul Ryan is going to be in the Congress next year so I mean he said he's retired he's not coming back\nShe went to that four times that leader was going to be a Paul Ryan up it if she won the seat\nTotally ignorant of the fact or lying to you that Paul Ryan is even going to be in Congress after New Years glee that so that was the first and foremost oh you know they went out and say we're going to drop a big giant lie on you or anchor Patrick lost her brain yeah in was\nIgnorant or as Michael Jackson would say on South Park you know ...\n... ... now\nI'm\nLeah right off the bat did a great job of saying I'm a homegrown Tucson girl she's a carpetbagger yeah she did a great job on the right off the bat without saying that she was cool no she said it did she say oh yeah\nI didn't say the word carpet back in all that time it was set everything yeah absolute she said yeah\nWe can now at an eye in view of a you're on the list for the ... seats the triple sees and all this stuff their email press release to warn you that this was coming up right they have their

fun cool\nAll right I didn't I didn't open that 'cause I didn't want to be biased you know 'cause it's just one it's the RMC site of this before it even started I wasn't going to read the ... and all areas but I'm Glad you did\nOkay that was hilarious uh let's see we got here we got um [noise]\nLet's see uh so uh one of the guys from Phoenix asked Leah about ducking the media\nAnd her what she has it's been part of the strategy but she used a strategic outreach\nWere engaged in strategic outraged rich I'm now are we started the jury strategic thinker GW are now here's the other one we had um\nAbout water right water future water is always you know a concern when you live in the middle of a desert right and so anchor Patrick went to more efficient water tanks and water sinks and she also went to the um\nOh we should be gathering more rain water to water your garden\nShe's still doing that one girl she went through the Rodney Glassman car learn how to Congress where she running for city council here\nAre looking through my notes with Matt last night uh let's stop the oh that was the other one ah she said we got to she's gone back to ... uh we should be the solar capital of the world and uh she ... she said let's stop using fossil fuel\nI said that if someone asked her about her coughing and sneezing or she'll blame it on the lack of universal healthcare or then or heard here's another thing actually I mean she stumbled she was not smooth it all she literally said oh when it comes to the border uh uh uh we need border policies that was an actual quote we need border policies\nAnd I said another visionary statement\nThen she went from of course child separations she's still working on that one I see that she's not upset by the south west you guys abusing children and having their place closed down I'm Susan other maker saying let's see what else uh\nPlace closed down I'm Susan other maker saying let's see what else a match right and calling for view and renegotiating a trade agreements she sounds like Trump [laughter]\nI'm been there done that lead I Lived at a nice job slapping Pima County on refusing the stone garden money last night and I might I must have been out for lunch I missed that a ... a anchor Patrick keeps repeating the uh Ryan line again so that ...\nThat's pretty fun uh like\nAir flight was the food the cabinet the FBI FBI if they have like one trick pony FBI she she was like I'm going Paul Ryan did does he mean anything in\nAnother another way that ... ah lived in a better job ... maybe should even though she did it maybe she did so we that's our hearing about Fort Huachuca Davis Monson\nThat was so funny this to tell you how it back to Michael Jackson eating the guy from uh Phoenix was his question is about\nYou know ... coming up in twenty Twenty one which of course his base realignment them closing mhm and the only brought up for what you gotta he didn't realize that Davis Monson is\nAlso in the district or he forgot it\nBut that came back but what was happening is so and just said oh you know this is important and you know I ... I was on a work group twelve years ago whatever right and wrong dress right and ... while I'm In the ... I'm I've been part of the southern Arizona defense alliance the I'm fifty and we work on this this that's why I've been working with local leaders\nBlah blah blah so if you weren't blinded by partisanship right you kinda go oh she is someone who's actually working inside\nWith a working into some with actual human beings to try to make it a little better\nIn all along the border I mean southern Arizona Hispanic Chamber of commerce of its ugly since ... I mean she's there she worked with these people I'm telling\nYou answer Patrick's blew it last night\n\nAbsolutely blew it now if you disagree with me give me a holler seven nine zero twenty forty but Ann Kirkpatrick was choking and coughing and she just\nBlew it\nThe um and again a shame on ... up at the at the republic\nThey they blew the story\nHe did not do a good job he'd been not talking about he kind of went through some of the answers but you didn't it was very ... this is obvious that anchor Patrick choked at last night oh yeah so it was is uncomfortable so here's here's a couple of things one I can see that email I've done this before I\nGet the fake uh fat typing the email dear Mr Patrick\nCalled today for your free consultation dedicated dental bite them three one nine zero zero that's five seven three one nine zero zero\nDownload the rate of faith\nWe have the Ukrainian\nCome to a lady that one was on Oprah\nLife without a warrant hunting\nFor the best in the northern style cooking trial a Mexican grill [noise]\nHer office probably about Nineteen Ninety give up on [noise]\nEven when he when he does that rain was yeah\nUh we got the yes on four sixty three folks ah when the longer here\nHopefully it doesn't do what happened to a\nVery David Senate Hispanic Chamber government affairs which is running for people but I trust one believes are going to do that to me so and then tailor Davis and will be here seven thirty in the morning read her third our\nGood morning to Marilyn Wiles good morning how are you doing young lady I'm doing peachy now we got a early ballots are supposedly being sent off today absolutely in science or general exactly [laughter]\nVery excited about it [noise]\nUm we've talked about or in your previous discussions together about your experience\nAnd a lot of your views on smaller government and try to look for efficiencies and things\nAnd so now that we're in the nitty gritty and you have people you're going against the incumbent who's been there for a little bit what I Want to know if I'm if you knocked on my door 'cause I Know you're knocking on doors in your district I Am and he said I Am and I'm someone who just I just don't know any better but I said I voted for this guy Bradley\nThe last couple of times what would you tell them on why they need to vote Marilyn Wiles a mutt David Bradley\nWell first of all he doesn't get anything done he's been in our state legislature for fourteen years\nUm I've heard him say that he's after this next term he's not going to run again and I'm saying\nWe don't have time to wait two more years of getting nothing from our state for my state senator in LT ten sure it's time to put somebody in there that you know I'm\nKnown to go in and roll up my sleeves I don't care what kind of job it is and to get in there and tackle it\nUm make sure that we've got the right resources in the right places at the right time we need to look at reforms I'm concerned about our education ah and I'm also concerned about our economy we're growing every time I'm Out and about and I hear great things about our economy absent but there's more there's just so much\n... even even leader said it in the debate last night the Pima County is lagging behind the rest of the state and economic prosperity\nExactly so I Want to get in there um I you know one of the things I said it's time to get things done and it's time for no more excuse his I Can't get this done because I Am a Democrat or I Can't get this done because I don't have the uh relationship to make it happen\nI'm a good relationship builder I can go into an organization and probably within just a few minutes size up what's what's really going on and pretty much have a plan ready to go quickly to make sure that we can take care of it\nSo when I see is and again you live in the district or you're on the east more on the east side of the Tucson is this guy is or represent them either in addition to not getting anything done what says presidents actually in the district what do you see him even using his office to do anything positive in the district\nWell it it's kind of funny because you're talking about knocking on doors um when I go in there and I've been asking ... so do you know who your state senator is in our elderly and like oh no that's pretty telling don't you think\nWell I'd say the a lot of people you're not going to the ... or ... or the president might not know who the rivers well yeah\nBut for me I Know what you're saying make surprises me that they don't know um and so when I stand there and I talk to them because I\nAm as people as you get to know me I can talk on almost any subject and when we get to to go on about what's happening in our district and what we're seeing at the state legislature we're just not getting the results that we need to get here in Pima County southern Arizona\nSo one of the things that I was telling your author when David Bradley was on the show a couple of years ago when he was running for reelection I asked him what is the most pressing issue in the state of Arizona\nThat he wants to tackle\nAll right so you still have education stuff out there it was before Trump getting elected and even an economy get going again really dug was starting to get things moving a little bit right but things are rocket more than the last two years he says the number one pressing issue in Arizona is to provide more free dental care to juveniles\nThat that was his amazing idea\nThe most pressing issue that's always in terms of what's going on with our\nChildren's education it is just didn't happen overnight right with you know we've been I'm going to say decades getting here it may take us a few more years to get out of it and why aren't we focusing on an education probably puts our children's academic success first\nWhy are we focusing on the economy um I'm Out there and I've been on platform or what some of our opponents and they're going to repeal you know any kind of the tax cuts that we have right and they want to raise our taxes well I just got my property tax bill and I I wasn't really happy with it\nWill also live in the u._s. be probably so you've got hit by that beautiful the editor nation but\nYes we did and you know there are people out there that can't afford more taxes so let's increase our tax payer base by creating a very robust economy\nNow to David Bradley vote for the twenty percent bump for the teachers and ...\nI Believe he did\nBecause at that point also part of the deal was that they had to move the desegregation money to the other tax classification and that's why\nMove the desegregation money to the other tax classification and that's why ... years are good people that this week send me their tax bill and ... and they can't believe they're paying an extra three hundred and thirty eight bucks or whatever they're doing for just the two USB decent going yep\nI'm so you've done the or the endorsements circuit over the last couple of months\nI have I'm what I'm finding is a lot of the incumbents are being endorsed and you know even if they don't do anything\nEven if they don't do anything absolutely you know why take a chance on an unknown you know as you know I started in here had zero name recognition but I guarantee a now I have name recognition out there and I'm determined to win and I'm determined to get out and get the vote going because people are now getting energizing away we can't\nOut when we need more people that are conservative in office\nWhen some of these uh
