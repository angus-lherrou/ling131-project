data and it is my favorite holiday of the\n... what do you dress up with them or you just watch them\nDo I dress that I invite you to follow me on Instagram every day on I have showcase one of my former costume\nCall and you're like my new daughter in law okay one of those crazy people Stephanie earlier today on John James and he's running for candidate for Senate and he's a West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter African American I played for him this clip of Eddie go out our mutual friend on your show this is what he said\nI had works politically but I Do because it means something citizenship in this country has always been tied to free white person system naturalization act and Seventeen Ninety so we can both this question of immigration and you're saying plans with the Republican base is all about a certain conception of what this\nThis idea why is it has led to eleven people being in in in Pittsburgh people in the program go people are less so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing to those bases\nDown at Seventy when I asked John James has been endorsed by Trump loves Trump is going to support Trump and is an African American what he thought about and they said well he got excited it's obviously passionate and true but it's not representative of the entire African American community what do you deal with that now versus\nVoice is representative an entire community but whether it's any or John or president shopper you or me my voice doesn't represent all women it doesn't represent our mothers doesn't represent off from New Jersey um so I I think that he can have the you know and I think the candidate you speak of Connecticut\nSo when ... says moral monster which is what I'm getting too it struck me as like when Julia ... said the Jake Tapper that the president had radicalized more people than ISIS and she had to stop and get in a moment to apologize I don't think Donald Trump's immoral monster do you\nI struggled with Donald Trump from the perspective right he's the president of the United states\nAnd while he might say things that you could say many I've said that at the dinner table you've said that at the dinner table\nIt doesn't matter I didn't have to hold himself to the highest adult or you could say Seventy it's no big deal that nationalist it means a patriot some could think that but knowing what he divided divisive time living if you're the president of the United states it is your obligation\nRaised us up on a more level and be absolutely careful\nAnd mindful of everywhere you well I agree with that and I am saying like I have a national is going on a patriot going I support America First\nJob being a great American so so in terms of being a moral monster I think the president doesn't put morals first and I think he doesn't but countries stars\nNow okay now I don't want to put you in a in a corner I moral monster though is different I really reject the president's used an enemy that people because it's just all of his term that usually was followed by a bullet through the back of the neck\nI really reject the politics of division I I reject a lot of stuff like that these done over there but he's not a moral monster he's a controversial damage on August\nAnd then ... if if you don't want to if you if you don't care so much about the division and the divide pick any topic you don't pick the topic is the president of all on stir that topic capitalize on division took a new conversation and talk about that I'd love to talk about that\nBut that's a that's the topic from your show that's why I picked that that's what it otherwise they wouldn't throw it out to exist Eddie on every show they\nKnow that something someone set on my show and then moved on but if you choose to continue to capitalize on it you're capitalizing on decision\nI don't I don't know if it's capitalizing if it's if it happens like the Julia Ioffe thing and it becomes obvious story coming back to it for one segment isn't capital I just wanted to know whether or not angry at that moment has\nHis has he chooses to believe that the president of the monster he can\nYou know what if I was an African American and I felt like president I'm not even sure if he acknowledged does to people who were killed because of their race at a croaker last week\nOkay and this is a purely professional question do you have an obligation as the host to say you know there are a lot of African Americans who don't agree with you Eddie when you call a memorial monster do you have that obligation\nI Do not feel like I have that obligation\nInteresting I I check the other day I'm One of my guests to who call someone a creature and I said I checked him I said they're not quite sure if

States Navy and President Trump promised a three hundred and fifty five ship navy during the campaign\nHe reiterated it on the deck of the Ford his Senate many many times it's been two years and we have a plan for a three hundred and eight ship navy and sucker defense Madison sector in the navy Spencer dodge the question again\nAnd again when are we going to get a plan on how to get the three fifty five 'cause that's what we need\nI Know every time I've heard you say that you have to remind myself to maybe get on that show and\nAnd let you know what did the reason is falling behind a little bit first of all nobody out there were very few see your listeners are different because they've heard of that for me to talk about they for others talking about in terms of what that Obama is due to the military\nNow I don't criticize Obama for this as he is and in the heart liberals who really you know where their priorities are and it's not in defending America but what we inherited from him uh we were in our army brigade combat unit is an example\nWe were down only thirty three percent of those diseases Lloyd Wright 'cause he has problems and all of that\nNow we have raised a thirty three percent of that so we're we're in the right direction\nNow this came as a result of our authorization bill infiltration bill you got to keep in mind we did a great school getting her ... through in record\nAnd then it broke ration all of a sudden we now have are racist they then it real serious problem this anyway that's resolved that problem I'd member army aviation brigade\nThey went down to twenty five percent twenty five percent to visit Floyd were no other area that I Would still go out is the the Marines used as a\nWe'll have thirty five percent of her essay seems to fly in and so that was that really serious problem we had along with the problem that was for that by just caramel Ulysses is that that is that we're out range and artillery in your ears\nSo somebody what do you do that to me I Know that you would like to prioritize and get started on this shift and I\nThink we can do it that's a long range program that I wanted to stop the bleeding and the areas that had is that as an immediate\nI get it and I understand that will take years but I mean I I have a young friend who is over at the front desk at the Senate Armed Services Committee Madison's barber and uh she's she's a college graduate work their way up over the ... good friend of mine I ask her every time have you seen the plan that she laughs because\nI think there ought to be a piece of paper that says this is how we're going to go from this number of ships to that number of ships and here's what we're going to build and here's we're going to build it and this was the year in which it's going to be done because it's what any rational business that had a metric to reach three fifty five\nWould produce now Jerry Hendricks is a retired navy captain got the front cover of National Review on how to get to three fifty five I Hope your your your committee will hold a hearing in December and say how do we get to three fifty five\nOkay I'll make you do you do you have Madison called me will be back in a week I guess ten days maybe you have a home they\nWill come and I do want to get the articles he referred to because I have not read it but I Do is there a nose is as well thought out the

other people when they come in here right 'cause they feel like I I feel like they're strapping in the you know be on NPR or something like that got none of none of this is not that kind of rating so

we're sitting there having breakfast and literally we have these conversations that you guys listen to for the seven plus years of Jewish here\nAnd we said look we're going to do this conversation and

freaking out a little bit right we always say this is us having coffee and someone puts the microphones and ... and that's the way we've always done this\nSo then you add on top of that\nThe idea that

accountability over they're much better way better now under Brent threat the guy\nAnd it was one girl ... called for a boycott on his own state\nAnd we said who are the people really getting hurt\nAnd the people really getting hurt by this are those employees that are making eight dollars an hour cleaning a hotel room or those are the the people who don't have the time or possibly the education to understand why things are the\nWay they are around here so that's you know when we say who's our who do we advocate for\nA someone who had it used to have a show on this station a friend who they are said how do you like blank show\nAnd I said who do you think this person advocates for on the show and he said I don't know and I said I Know who I advocate for\nAnd so we're advocating again not just taxpayers small business owners but really the average worker out there who doesn't understand why why it's so hard to make a diamond Pima County\n\nYou know when ... was shot his mouth off\nAnd called for a boycott on Arizona the story that you didn't hear in the Arizona Daily Star or have Tim stellar cry about organ or even the draw cartoon right right because you'd have to admit that someone you admire Raul Grijalva hurts the constituents that he says he serves\nAnd he was just in his mid thirties and he died on Saturday of a heart condition and it was a really stunning the forty niners which is our youth football team down here\nIs very very successful or on the field that wins a lot of games\nThat are it also helps shapes a young people are through sports and he was involved in that so this is a pretty setting for our community\nWell again um you just never know and we go to carrier so I'm having a heart attack at age thirty four unbelievable\nYeah absolutely no no signs or anything before that and ah so you see these are folks around town a lot I Know of several in our neighborhood play for the team and so this is a a quite a blow so there's a big effort to help out of the family and we'll certainly be involved in that\nMaybe you need any help promoting we've been let us know when will it\nWill do it appreciate that some people his wife Jamie and his kids AJ Jay Lynn and a Isaac in your prayers at\nUm what did you do to piss off GV our people okay I Am seeing these letters to the editor green valley recreation and you talked about someone's comments at the finance meeting or whatever yeah what what is going I mean this green valley recreation\n[noise] yeah I don't know\nYeah they ... they are have about Seventy percent of the people who live in green valley belong to it and it's just a it's Thirteen a rec centers and all the programs that everything is very important and they're going through the budgeting process and uh\nIt's a board of twelve people evenly split six and six to believe that part of an believe that you know the budget needs to get bigger and that does need to go up and the other six are saying you know what we want to scrutinize every single line item\nAnd decide whether the budget should go up whether that's warranted or not so we have a obtains confidential documents I'm\nFrom a couple of years ago that answer a lot of questions about uh GV are and how it should be moving forward and we have put those in print a couple of times actually\nAnd they're upset about it they're now on a tear to find out who is forking over the documents and\nYou know you have twelve board members but they've already determined about three dozen people have had access to these to these documents and so my ah we're we're talking you know\nPolygraph tests and it's basically it's it's basically a witch hunt and so they have decided that they're they may try to write a letter to the editor a and say hey please don't use digital documents in the future I Can't\nI Can't help but laugh or what what they should be doing is uh okay yeah we won't do our jobs like you know we only put the paper if ah it ah\nIs going to help the community we don't do it to say hey we got you because that's that's not the way to to do journalism but ah these documents or speak some truth to what is going on and it's important that uh that they get out there they really shouldn't be asking how we got the documents it should be asking\nA why we thought it was important to put them in the paper why somebody felt it was important to give them to us because that would answer far more important questions and how did they get these darn\nThings why is there's so much drama because I've been thinking about it and he's got me in that retrospective mood with Doug come home with or an hour chair for I remember the early days of our conversation\nAnd it was the DVR was having the the whole drama with the lady who was going to do the talking about the right to die and whack yourself\nBoy yes ...\nIt just seems like what why is it because it's kind of is it because there if you move into that neighborhood you're forced to pay for these is that is that why there's that dynamic of forcing you to pay for something that you may not want or not really use all of it\nWell you know I think what it amounts to is that green valley is full of what we call F. I. peas formerly important people\nThose and those people love power and they love control\nNow not all of them are like that summer in it for the good of the organization that community but it it is just like you would see on the town council or a board of supervisors or in Congress these are people who\nUh who who like control and and uh\nAnd and power now most people just come down here that want to retire and play golf and pickle ball and not have to worry about this and that would be about Ninety nine percent uh but there are some who\nThis is kind of what they dig they like getting involved in a policy and community issues and that's good I'm Glad for them but I think some of them are probably in it for the wrong reasons so\nThen there are also as a group on there that's looking out for people who\nWhose retirement perhaps it's not as comfortable as others retirement so these are people who are relying on Social Security perhaps exclusively\nAnd they do is keep going up now\nGB hours at tremendous bargain it's just about five hundred dollars a year\nAnd you have access to all of these different facilities and programs and it's a terrific bargain but people have seen that just going up and up and up and say well wait a minute let's let's figure this out let's go through every single line of the budget\nAnd decide whether we need to have you know twenty custodians or do we need to have Thirteen rec centers you know some of the rec centers are one room\nIn a pool and that's and that's a satellite right that or do we need all this I think the conversation is one that should be had I'm not advocating one way or the other they can figure that out themselves but some information has been withheld and that has been frustrating to some of the uh the board\nDaniel can I ask you to hold on for a few commercials move for drinks we got damn sure green really knew through to some editor and we come back we're going to read this letter to the editor about four sixty
