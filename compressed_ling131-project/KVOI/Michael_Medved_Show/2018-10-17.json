the bag in Texas I mean after all types that were heavily Republican state Ted Cruz's word very hard as a U.S senator has for six years and particularly his work with constituents in constituent groups and constituent services have been great\nHe should win this election he should win it big time so why was this debate last night featuring Ted Cruz and his Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke\nAre considered to be so TV worthy and it's gotten coverage like no other candidates debate much closer races\nWhy because honestly I Do believe that the Democrats are excited about the idea of NATO running for president when he loses\nAnd\nWhy would that be to his advantage look there are reasons that the only times in the um last\nWhat is it last hundred and fifty years that a sitting US Senator has been elected president of the United states has been a rock Obama and John Kennedy\nAnd those were exceptional cases when you're in the Senate it's tough to find time to campaign

running better shopping Michael ... who's running\nUm maybe I because he's pretty good I mean again for a Democrat I think his ideas are ridiculous but um he looks sincere\nAnd er he puts his thoughts well let me give you a sample from this debate now first of all I'm\nOne of the um uh one of the tricks that he performed and this will be cut number five was a President Trump is very popular in Texas and of course Senator Cruz been a big supporter of President Trump\nSo Beto in the debate went right to that issue listen\nCrews and not going to be honest with you have to make up positions and votes but I've never held or ... for the president called them wind and that's why the nickname so because it's for\nOkay so he's picking up lying ... to President Trump and um then a bait so I'm president as Senator Cruz is saying look and it's true if the Democrats win control\nOf the house and Senate ... it's\nMacron's win control of the house in the Senate ... it's going to be a complete just total warfare and investigation and impeachments and this and that all the time here was bad tells response\nNumber four\nReally interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after six years and in the U.S Senate I'm listening um if you have this special relationship with President Trump um than than where is the result of that um we were all talk\nAnd no action um the tariffs that the president has loving the praying wars that he is entering this country into is hurting no state war than it's hurting Texas are farmers or ranchers are producers are manufacturers and exporters right here in San Antonio at the Toyota plant or a million I bought or tundra and met the folks\nWho made it yes we have problems with other countries around the world China dumping aluminum and steel manipulating their currency I Want to make sure that we stand up to China but whenever we ever gone to war including a trade war without any allies and that's exactly what the president was er cruises help\nWould have us do we've alienated the European Union they only native Canada and Mexico we've alienated all other potential partners and we're going it alone against China and it is not working just listening to the farmers and I know you haven't had the chance to to visit every county but I have and I've listened to them and they are hurting\nAny anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these trade wars will end or the day of knowing that when those trade wars do when\nThose buyers and those other countries will find other people from home for bought from and they will no longer be coming to Texas\nTo buy what we grow what we raise what we export and when we what we manufacture\nOkay it all sounds good except it's a complete lie and we're not telling us alone one of the biggest achievements that President Trump already it pained was he did replace NAFTA he said he would he did we're not going it alone we have a trade deal and it's a better trade deal with Canada with Mexico thank you President Trump\nWe also have the better trade deal with South Korea remember at one point there was talk\nAbout that I'm Ted Cruz a\n... this is actually very sad uh the uh Ted Cruz was actually attacked in the debate because of his response to a good question and I actually was on his response was fine\nBut again the media that are trying to build up to eight or ... not just in the hopes that he might be able to actually become competitive in this election I don't think he will but because they want to promote him as a candidate for two thousand and twenty\nCandidates\nWho are on the on the ballot this time and then in some states they even have third party candidates I'm more than that how do you how do you keep any of that straight\nBecause they're very few places where there aren't multiple congressional races in other words I get a North Dakota are there's only one member of Congress Ken Kramer is the only member of the house\nAnd he's running for Senate but

largest democracy in the world India\nAnd the riots has to do with the issue of religious liberty it's very complicated over there but thank God we don't have that here one of the reasons we don't have that here is because of the alliance defending freedom honestly\nBecause they stand up for religious liberty so people don't have to quote take it to the streets and basically\nCommit violence against the government it's it's a a ... that is never authorized there's always a terrible idea\nAnd actually fighting for our constitution which is one lines defending freedom does every single day is is crucial\nAnd right now alliance defending freedom like other nonprofit organizations\nRelies on the generosity of other people\nBut the alliance defending freedom cannot continue to fight these

also been a guest on this show David had this to say\nI Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened in the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive it uh it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing a chief\nAnd it's quite ironic just say that we're being inclusive intolerant by firing someone\nWho disagrees with artificial fuse that that's what actually happens\nOkay and it's nonsense we're being inclusive and tolerant and patriotic and liberty

come back or is just coming back from Saudi Arabia where he met with the crown prince\nUh I think they're handling it well I Know that goes against what most people have been led to believe by

Washington for instance um when people talk about quote cutting Social Security they're talking about cutting the rate of increase you\nKnow nobody ever and nor should people talk about cutting back what's already pledged in Social Security but it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal

some restrictions apply the storefront detail with good well it's so easy to do good\n\n\nWelcome back as the bench Shapiro show so new battle has broken out not even really between right and left but within both right and left over the future direction of the American economy and it's across the political Baron is really quite interesting\nOn the one hand you have folks who say globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people who are left behind or working jobs that get eliminated\nNow the normal answer in the past was get up get a new skill we do that is why America bands from coast to coast and its relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York and decided I'm going to go out to the middle of nowhere and across territory where people want to kill me and we go out in the middle of nowhere to set up a claim and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death\nIn or is that I can make something more myself my dad is the American ideal but that's what I was going by the wayside because we now believe that\nEverybody is entitled to things weren't entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here\nYour number one is globalization and redistribution free markets everywhere and if people are left behind than we have a a basic income universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net and that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nAnd those people we just give them money basically the ... races everybody wanting theater and then everybody who is left behind a little bit we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better that they can live better that was my number one and\nA lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the break him say that's not right they say instead we really needed a new model of how to thing and the model of how the thing is about jobs how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning that if you don't have a job you have less meaning\nSo what are we just restricted the free market itself what if we put barriers on the free market to orange credit orange cat\nHe doesn't really ... ... where we recommend tons of restrictions on the free market you talked about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets rare actually relieve regulations make it easier to generate jobs but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example and there's a real push by someone from in populist right to restore union power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of the union not companies breaking unions that has led to the dark union in the United states\nSo that model number two is you restrict the free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version\nSo it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals were for globalization and ... and redistribution of conservative or for globalization and redistribution\nYou have liberals who are poor workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives who are for workers and not free market now the actual answer to this problem is look at what free markets to\nLook at what free markets too and if President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he would be saying right now he me ... all he would just pointed at his economy everything you know you're all worried about the logical development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nIt goes to show her the famous economist coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry we'll write when out of business are literally people whose job it was to make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nBut guess what that created new jobs in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cards in other words certain jobs get destroyed so we can all live better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and ... and that's the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting the environment around you\nThis idea that we can't adapt and adjusted new technology seems to me completely wrong had\nAll the talk about how all the jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing jobs by\nRestricting the free market it's a big mistake the reason
