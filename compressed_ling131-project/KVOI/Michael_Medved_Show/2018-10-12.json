faith and you don't believe that there is that kind of hostility right now there is a campaign underway and it's being advanced\nBy members of the judiciary all of them by the way appointed by Democrats who are trying to get rid of any kind of religious symbolism on Grey's\nOr war memorial and this is crazy stuff\nAnd the alliance defending freedom is in this fight to protect religious liberty to to stop people from trying to change America to race any signs or expressions of religious faith\nUh here's a um a a brief statement of why the alliance defending freedom exists\nAlliance defending freedom as an organization that advocates for the right people to freely live out their face that reminds us that as Christian called all about our faith in the marketplace at our jobs that are schools\nWe also want people to remember that when they do that and they're persecuted for their faith that we will defend them and their right to live out their fate\nOkay this is what alliance defending freedom does all the time but they can only do it with your help\nUh we had a terrific day yesterday really great response I'd love it if it could be even better today on friday or go to Michael med dot com click on the banner where it says I Want to defend religious freedom and it'll tell you all about the alliance defending freedom is on the current fights\nOr ... and Michael midday dot com click on the banner I Want to defend religious freedom and if you can give fifty\nDollars right now which um if\nYou think about it going into the weekend if you're planning to go out you could easily spend fifty dollars right now there's fifty dollars becomes a hundred dollars to help they truly important organization\nThat is fighting for what most Americans believe in and fighting against political correctness go to Michael ... dot com click on the banner which is I Want to defend religious freedom or even call them its toll for eight\nEight six six nine five four\nThree three eight eight and ... if you'd call they'll double the money to because we have a matching fund so cold right now alliance defending freedom eight six six nine five four three three eight it'll take you maybe Ninety seconds and you'll feel great\nUh feel free to cooperate is standing by eight six six nine five four three three eight eight okay I'm\nOne of the questions about this story in San Francisco which of course is creating all kinds of controversy or understand that there are lots of people who resent and don't like the pledge of allegiance\nBut the idea of swapping the pledge of allegiance for another early meaningless and phony Maya Angelou quote that she never said go says when you learn teach when you get give look I think that if Steven Cook who sounds like he's a very well intentioned decent guy et cetera et cetera et cetera if he wants to\nA decent guy et cetera et cetera et cetera if he wants to\nAdd to the school board meetings by giving quotes from Toni Morrison and James Baldwin and I'm Harvey Milk and I says Abraham Lincoln as well I'm fine\nBut why can't you give those quotes right after you say the pledge of allegiance why try to erase the pledges if this was some kind of substitute because a pledge itself takes about thirty seconds no it really does that's all\nAnd again don't we all benefit\nFrom gestures that can unite us right now at a time when so many Americans are feeling so polarized and on the edge and threatened and bullied is even the law in the interim who's had an interview she may be the most bullied person in the world and no she's not talking about her husband\nWell maybe now um meanwhile\nThere's this and this is one of those cases that is just appalling\nThere there was a terrible terrible miscarriage of justice and it shows you why this issue of judges and appointing judges is really just about the most important issue on the docket\nAfter three years of litigation a three judge panel of the fourth U.S Circuit court of appeals determined that a a memorial that's almost a hundred years old in ... Maryland is unconstitutional\nWhy is this one hundred year old memorial is to people who died in World War one no one is alive who fought in World War one\nBut\nSomehow this lawsuit is stayed alive they've been protesting this memorial for years and now in a divided court chief judge Roger Gregory\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task or renting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majorities as their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably\nA seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people\nFrom that community who died in World War one by creating a monument in their honor and putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now is this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much Michael we're taking my call I have a couple of points on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman that San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being tracked\nI I Love this about the ... you know all you have to do now is just really with those views that they hold and all of sudden it's becoming right that's how they would know this is ... ...\nAnd the other examples you're bringing I mean you know fake are wonderful higher education system\nWe all we have this no hate America embarrassed for America anything old traditional like the constitution forget it\nWithout David ... former New America which you know the almighty phony moral list and I'm sure that they think they are they're going to shape a new American\nAnd it was put up more than fifty years ago and the efforts by people to dismantling are sick and it's crazy\nSomebody wants to make a case for it give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six a a quick word from relief factor this came in from a man\nThat I had had severe back pain for over a month I had tried everything I could think of and the pain wasn't going away\nOnce I started taking ever leave factor within less than two weeks the pain was gone and I was able to sleep at night\nOkay yes you can sleep at night better you can enjoy waking hours in the daytime more because the ... and the pain that people feel sometimes just through the course of living can be greatly reduced for most people it starts working in five or six days no really\nAfter that first week you're taking three little packets a day and then you take two little packets a day\nFor the next two weeks and for most people that worked so well they ended up getting more relief factor over Seventy percent of people do go to relieve factor dot com that is really factor dot com nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world to gain\nWhat is the um one group and the population\nWhere there is more sympathy for political correctness [noise]\nWe'll let you know coming right up on them and that show [noise]\nLife insurance is tremendously important that's always

allegiance and to replace it with a quotes and opening of San Francisco school board meetings\nBy the way they claim that it's particularly appropriate open and with the Maya Angelou quote because Maya Angelou graduated from George Washington high school\nIn San Francisco are they still allowing it to be named George Washington high school even though you know he owned slaves\nOr though it is absolutely true he provided that the slave should all be freed at his death and he actually made arrangements for that to happen\nThough didn't happen until Martha's death but that's another story in any event uh there's also the story of trying to erase\nA war memorial because ask crosses on it and one of the questions here\nIs raised about what happens to Arlington\nBecause Arlington is not so

demolishing the pass by just erasing it\nAnd\nThis goes way way way way beyond some Confederate statues on top of high pillars right we're talking now about grades and about honoring the phone\nAnd ah I\nI mentioned that look everybody in America dislikes political correctness though the one group of Americans where opposition to political correctness falls below Seventy percent is that uh people with postgraduate degrees\nIn other words you have a master's degree or a PHD or an MBA degree or a law degree\nOr I guess it even counts if you have an M. F. A. a master and fine arts whatever you happen to have if you have a post graduate degree then you are more likely to accept political correctness do get this it's still sixty six percent of people

situation except the one slept with Kim cardiac on tape that\nHow is that even on CNN CNN called news network and do that sort of thing that's just garbage it's just I think people are worse than that of John Lennon who is a disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jake Tapper\nVery often tries to be objective and tries to actually do his job done one that has had forsaken all\nRelationship with objectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not an opinion journalists serious John Lennon\nIn invoking Kanye West's dead mother to attack him his bed mother to attack him\nDon't worry this is just journalism got so much journal is making so much reporting happening right here\nThis was an embarrassment\nConyers mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends but they checked it with one of her friends today from Chicago dog just rents are used to live there I Know\nShe said ... would be what would be embarrassed by this\nThat an okay thing is that something that we're doing now are a lot of technical dead relatives are dead relatives to attack them not their dead relatives in the sense that like their dead relatives did something wrong but in the sense that a dead relative who you didn't know and know nothing about and had a relationship with this man that she would be ashamed of him\nThat should be ashamed of Tanya what like\nThat this was ... I'm Sorry this is just sick and the media is overall reaction to the ... what shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump\n... the media hates no one like a black person and said they like President Trump no one because they have violated the tenets of introspection analogy which suggest that we all think like our group we often like our ethnic group do you break away from that ethnic group or you break away from that sexual group that you're a gay person who likes Trump or you're a woman\nWhere you break away from that sexual rope right you're a gay person who likes Trump or you're a woman who likes Trump is there any of those things than you are at trader\nOr we saw this with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh they were they were sex traders they've just given into the patriarchy they internalize The Handmaid's tale and now we see this with Connie what's he's a black guy who's really white on the inside he's an Oreo right I mean black on the outside the white on the inside he's he's in the sunken place\nAs people are now saying rented it and that sort of stuff\nIs deeply race but that's why the left is is ... because he breaks two of their rules one he's a black men's sports from not allowed\nTo use the celebrities reports from also not a lab for people to understand how much from his hated in Hollywood you have to understand that in Hollywood if you even express remotely right wing opinion you will never work again\nNever work again I said before I have celebrities and listen to show their major April I'm not talking to a celebrity and talking a plot celebrities listen to this show and I visited with some of them and had lunch or breakfast people come into the office were quite famous and I always tell them do not mentioned that you have been there if you wish to work in this town\nBecause the bias in Hollywood is so extreme and it doesn't matter you're citing celebrity if you said even associated with me and I didn't vote for Trump at twenty six saying if you say that you associated with me just a mainstream conservative it was pretty reasonable\nAnd that is enough to lose your job like that actually happened out here with mark and plus you just got destroyed read mark you plot the guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's got a bunch of other is on the ... the Mindy project he's been a bunch of other stuff he came in here because you wanted to get a pro gun opinion from somebody for his new movie and so he came in\nAnd I gave him like an an hour and a half and I said don't tell anyone you hear that you do it will blow back on you and then he foolishly went on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world\nHe was attacked so harshly on Twitter he deleted the ... and then put up with we apologizing for ever having tweeted that I was a nice die\nBy apologizing for that that's how it works in Hollywood so counties broken tools to black man and he's short nearly famous and if you are a black school nearly famous person you are not allowed to be pro Trump and you're not allowed to be concerned with it anyway you have to a total liberal line\nAnd you wonder why you send your great shock and dismay Taylor Swift came out and embrace the Democratic party because if you do not embrace the Democratic party and you are a celebrity they will tearing down\nAnd we're on the right joke for a long time about the fact that that was not than anything politically because what kept

Trump actually have a shot at breaking out of the five to ten percent box Republicans have been in in the black community for a long time and that's because as it turns out that they talked about yesterday\nMinorities are not wedded to the woke social justice warrior version of politics Democratic Party wants to embrace ... showing that right now and that is good because there is an important
