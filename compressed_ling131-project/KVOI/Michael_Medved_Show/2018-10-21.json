folks\nThank you Bob the factor hammer time radio show I Am Marie sorority from handyman saving a transmitting on a um ten thirty gave you a why the voice shouted called Terrell Tucson in the a handyman saving radio studio\nWe didn't talk a little bit about some education on the counter tops discuss that in the previous segment another item that we've been I'm Talking about Donald just started this past week and this is a recurring a subject that comes up\nAnd it has to do with the customers are clients or understanding some of the fantastic would descriptions that we have a four naming various types of woods\nUh and it does get rather confusing and I basically have a good understanding of what the customer is asking for\nA however I think some time period that they could be misled or with or not understanding of what they're asking for in reference to what's available when we talk about cabinet construction\nSo what are the leading statements as a client comes into the store is that they would like to have a solid wood cabinet\nSo one of the first things that I asked them is uh what is their definition of solid wood and basically speaking they said well uh we're we're we're interested in or not having a particle board or as far as the side panels or the base\nOf the ... floor or the back and I can understand that from that standpoint and so I Try to give them some information concerning wood and what we use in the ah what area in compositions\nAnd there's really two types of words that are available or one is that uh we have engineered woods which may very well be considered solid wood and then also we have a dimensional lumber or another term is being used is a solid lumber would\nA solid lumber would or dimensional lumber\nIs something that we would go down in a purchase at a lumber yard which would be a one before\nA would be a two before a four by eight a or an eight by eight right depending upon what we're a requiring for the project that we're trying to develop\nAlong with that well one of the major difficulties that ah every craftsmen has with the dimensional lumber or solid lumber would is that we're at the the disposal of the killing ... content or the\nDryness of the wood or there is a specified I'm a value associated with the dampness of the woods and if you go down to the home centers and see a lot or two before ...\nGo down to the home centers and see a lot of two by fours or to base or two but two hours or whatever they may happen to be you'll see them all sort of randomly placed on the racking system and you see many of them there that have all sorts of curves attached to him and\nThat is because that type of wood has not been killed and dry and appropriately or has gathered too much moisture in this transition from the mail or to the distribution center\nSo with that being in mind the American plywood association as it's called a recognizes that engineered would as well as many other types of wood that it can be classified as engineer woods is much more stable environment\nAnd such things as a wouldn't doors as an example or we have many many types of wouldn't doors that are available in fact we can probably get a up to ten Fifteen different types of wood species for wouldn't doors\nAnd I will guarantee you that uh that solid would dorm or not dimensional would door or a solid lumber ... because they all are the near today as far as many of the services go that they're designed and built that way because of stability\nSo that being the case\nOr they don't necessarily warranty or for warping bending or twisting but the indication is that door is not going to war twister band as as a reference to the or if it happened to be dimensional lumber that that door was made out of\nA dimensional lumber will basically work twist in bend unlisted is killed and dried or of appropriately a to reduce the moisture level of the wood well that's the only valid during the time period that comes out of the kill\nHowever by the time is transmitted to an area of high moisture content like a it is in the Tucson, Arizona here or during the monsoon season when the relative humidity gets up to around Seventy eighty Ninety percent of the temperature is not too hot\nNot lie down in the southern portion of Texas along the south eastern border to the United states are up the east coast\nWhere the relative humidity could be Ninety Ninety five percent as well as the temperature being vicinity of a hundred degrees\nAnd if he ever are in that area you'll find out that is so stuffy so to speak that's because the body can't breathe appropriately the evaporation doesn't take place when you perspire or sweat depending upon your gender\nA there is lots of forms of engineered lumber engineered lumber sometimes do we use the word at it's manmade or I guess today we could even be politically correct and says woman made\nA it's made by human beings\nAre obviously it's considered lumber from that standpoint because it does come from a tree or which produces the lumber\nSo the common forms of engineered lumber would be medium density and high density of fiber board\nOr that type of lumber which the standard she says I mentioned earlier would be four feet by eight feet or they may be able to provide a larger diminishing up to five feet wide\nAnd an certain cases they can go as a ... the lengths could be increased to twelve feet\nSo that's a pretty good a hunk of lumber and we do use at our store in our mail shop for countertop production or those types of um materials or because of the countertop though we'd like to provide for the customer\nSo you've got to medium Jesse and high density of ...\nUh that is basically scrap pieces of lumber in any other pieces of wood particles that are available it's all ground up into a motion like you'd put it into your blender as an example of put a lot of glues or two that are compress it down\nInto the thickness that they're looking for you know a quarter inch and a half inch creates a five day it's a up to an end sometimes you can get larger pieces an inch and a half\nAnd that is used for various aspects of\nOf woodworking in order to uh take advantage of the largest of the of planks are the four by ... that are available in order to get a a tree as an example that would have a a\nType of would that would be available at your forty eight inches wide you can imagine what the size of that tree would be and how long it would have to be around I think those would be probably protected as old growth and nobody would be authorized to cut them down\nSo then there's always be which is called oriented strand board that is a form of a a chopped up would as an example\nUh mainly it appears to me to be more from a wood shavings\nOr or from a ... ... ... or ... players that have these wood chips available they take those they put 'em together they are putting them under compression along with a lot of glues\nGloom together in the type of sheets that we've talked about four by it and some times larger sheets and various sicknesses\nAnd then there's what we commonly called as plywood now plywood is a very interesting term when it comes to the American plywood association or under engineered products that they recognize in that\nAny time that you have more than one pieces one piece of wood that his glued together that could be considered a plywood there are such huge pieces that are glued together of which has another formal name of the glue laminated ...\nAnd many times when you go into large buildings as if you come down to our stores is an example I can show you some glue lambs that we used in order to\nA span certain areas but uh today that could also be using steel but a while back as we were using glue lambs\nOr we happen to have in our store or several glue lambs that actually came out of a remodeling of the k-mart stores in Tucson that I was able to purchase in order to accomplish the construction that we needed to accomplish a at a handyman ...\nThey are very strong there are very stable or you could call those uh plywood as an example of when they take ten pieces of two by aids and gloom they gather\nA the only difference and that would be is that the length of the two by eight search you by tens whatever they're using are all in the same direction\nA plywood in term would indicate that maybe applies are Ninety degrees to each other as they are built up the thickness of the ...\nThe other thing about ... I was just coming of various sicknesses from eight to ... all the way up to an inch inch and a half possibly and they can come from four by age ... even as large as five by twelve\nA plywood at south as we know when you go down to the home centers of by the plywood they come in various uh flies a standard ply on dinner piece of would be about three or four applies\nI'm On deck er pliers they could be up to orange decker ... applied where they could be up to five ply seven flies\nThere is a plywood called Baltic plywood which originated in the Baltics of Europe and they are typically nine flies\nWe actually have supplies\nA plywood available not available but plywood cabinets that are made out of a eleven or twelve applies\nA three quarter inches from that standpoint but when you make plywood there's two ways that you get the would back in the olden days I was I mentioned earlier they were like cutting sliced bread as an example of cutting Britain's slices and that was called sliced pork plywood\nAnd they will be glued together a in various uh Ninety degree formats and you could tell the seams arm or as they were glued together into the plywood for by cheats today we also have the capability of cutting plywood or the veneer so to speak as it's called\nIn rotary cutting\nAnd that is basically taken a big log are shaping up shaping up appropriately that so it's a dimension only sound a on a complete diameter from one end to the other and then using a laser cutting technique\nTo slice off the rotary sheets of plywood they can be as thin as um\nSecond or an eighth of an inch all the way up to whatever thickness that you want we do have one door down to the store that has about an eighth inch plywood as it's been their surfaces let's see we have a caller on the line and named to fill up a good afternoon to you Phillip welcome to the average time radio show\nYeah good afternoon you you're talking about laminated large sections that I went on the floor I I was wondering if that ever did that um ... is a creek\nWell if it's not fast into probably it will creek\nAs you or walk on it [noise] but certainly are assuming that the span is not too large a viewer of floor Joyce's up from that standpoint you would uh be anchoring apply would normally to a floor Joyce's so you probably have a pulse and being home\nUh in in many type of homes are are designed that way especially in the the mid west and the south so that's how they were generally built we have come across those homes in Tucson\nWhere people have posted in being able to big crawl space underneath that where they can get underneath there to do the plumbing or whatever they need to be so quick in yes\nAh they could be good they could be anchored with the screws and the appropriate fashion or in order to try to eliminate the creek ing and there are various other techniques that are available\nSo what you're saying it's pretty hard to get the silence of the lambs\nA yes or they they do stay away from bombs and things like that yes actually out but\nIf you're using glue and screws is what he's saying fill up as you you are you tend to have pretty quiet floors what happens is over the years ... with older floors with nails is but that's where you're hearing the ... as the the word is press down and then comes up so we have\nTo have a heart problem I have a heart problem I have been able to solve and that you haven't been able to either there's a certain type of plastic that comment you can't go together have you ever heard of what I'm Talking about [noise] no I ... I ... well then how do you get ... wealthiest together like\nWell there there's probably a special glues that will dissolve and I do know that ah when you talk about counter tops only talked about the acrylic solid surface counter tops there are special glues designed\nThat will actually melt or both pieces that you're trying to blue together\nAnd it uses the entire countertop together as if you are willing to pieces are still together you actually melt steel and then with a rod or a wire or that mixes in there and forms a joint when you grind it down you may not even be able to see the joined at all\nSo I just have to you have to get the appropriate a glowing chemical\nThat will melt those two pieces together and form of single piece for you\nAs adults commercially available and what what I look like\nWell they are commercially available or I don't know who would have them in Tucson but I'm sure by going onto the Web than running a search engine for glowing joints\nI I can get glues for acrylic solid surface you can get would goose for would as an example uh but as far as grueling various types of plastic together\nListening today and thank you for your time and we'll see you next week\nYou've been listening to him or is on a program dedicated to helping you have a healthier for comfortable livable house living in workspace\nAdvertising as an independent program on Katie ally\nOpinions are those of the host he asked in colors and not necessarily the sponsors or Katie ally podcaster past shows the advertisers are available at ... dot com more information and helpful here can be found at a handyman haven dot com\nThanks for listening [noise]\nTalk twenty four seven AM gym three GeoEye ... to shock on the Web at ... dot com\nDuring this hour from town hall dot com line down the ...

well in school and you should use uh your other time to learn and so I became very active member of the local public library and going in there every\nFucking for all the setting new bucks it would come in and I remember one time I Try to read all\nTwenty volumes of the way they panic on the basis and I would have a database of ah\nEverything that has happened in the world but then I realized that uh I was only have a river and mirror with everything that happened before or the book was published though I realize the important thing is keeping up to date with a new trend in the market\nAnd I I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead to influence you a little bit\n[noise] yeah I certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was ... you know they were I was actually working for me to come around and drop off in the paper today off if there are on their front step um and and then I could tell from a you know when I was I mean they make their collection on Saturday to\nUh for the deliveries as they would be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nA greatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis that every day a week\nOr ... moving on 'em you went to parochial school as a as a young man as a boy and I'm telling me a little bit about St Martin in Philadelphia was sort of damage your disadvantage going to a parochial school would that do for you\nWell I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on the quality of education and making sure that we were learning and doing well in our uh our care I'm going forward so that was a helpful and they certainly do they\nKnow belief and the importance of living a moral and ethical wife and ah you know and that really that God is an important a factor in your life and that you follow the commandments and\nShould treat people with respect and um um you should make sure that you do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of and do it right in the long run you\nYou'll wind up having to do though\nIs that what you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\nAre exactly and that usually a pay pays off I think you know what goes around comes around with you and they have a you know it started to see other people pretty soon though that a deception is known and then people you know you lose their confidence that you and if a movie's you the confidence\nYou lose their confidence that you and if a movie's you the confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not willing to trust you and follow your ideas adjusting so um it is a very counterproductive to you know take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nHad during your time and St Martin in high school um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA Oh yes it was they had the various towards the medals for the best and the subject than the uh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and the\n... was a you know wanted to uh get on the top of all the lists are so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things I was going to look to eventually you went from St Martin's and you've got accepted\nMIT my records told me you were the first student from St Martin's to ever get accepted to MIT tell the listeners what you did a sister so creative um the project they got the attention that got you in an MIT\nYeah as I mentioned I go to the public library of several times a week and a one day I went in there and I have fifty three and there was a new book that has just been published and was available called giant brain the machines that I think it was\nFirst book to try to explain how these new computer technology but really enhance the power of the human mind would extend the memory facts available to people greatly with to be able to\nSee patterns in data super high speed and ... make more insightful decisions and be more productive so I got so excited about this that I uh about two months of savings from my paper with those every and went down to the hardware store\nAnd bought strip civil room with them for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs\nUh from flashlights and plywood boards and\nAnd a bill to pay a handmade computer system a made up little relays\nOf at a plate and unbeatable game of tic tac toe ah so ah and then I found that when I gave it to my friends that are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they notice they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back every uh forty F move with the random occasionally they could win that found that a factor of hope\nI made the machine very very popular and it was always lots of people queuing up to a class\nAnd Vegas would love you and\nIt was added into a science fair and what a prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia\nA you know to get me a full scholarship to go to MIT to study a more seriously computer science and\nParticularly ah I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective and they use for people because she would see the analogy between the human intelligence and and the intelligence created through a V. electronic design of the system now\nPat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encouraged or discouraged from director or the new specials at your school\nA while that was it's an interesting point when I did that get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic school and the director says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that they're in the Catholic tradition and ah\nI said right appreciate that but uh\nI Would like to know for get myself I'm interested in technology and I wanted to go to school that has the best reputation for teaching technology and you know that they do have a chaplain there and I'll be able to\nContinue to attend religious services so I I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could've subject\nI was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but ah I just stuck to my commitment\nYou being kind my research said there's no way you're going to get in the ...\nThere were a big uh I'm uh twenty thousand students before me that uh and never had a five and has ever been accepted that was the first one they tested to MIT\nYou are very humble man of folks are going to find out you know packets accepted an MIT he takes biophysics how old is a ... student make the transition into business and build up what is today a multibillion dollar diversified business\nRight doll boy I liked that business model [laughter] so I called the\nUh the publisher of the magazine owner of the magazine I said I\nJust talked to the head of this a computer company wants to do some market research and you know um who would you like to be a undertaking that he said no no no that's not my field and\nIf he wants to do it on your own You're welcome to take the risk so I went um I saw that interview was on friday\nA over the weekend I wrote a proposal for this research and I sent it out to about fourteen companies and to my amazement within two weeks I got a check for twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment\nFrom nine companies huh so so I had a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars the checks I rushed to the bank or\nBecause I had made up a name called international cooperation to ah just for the proposal purposes it\nWas just going to be a shot in the dark and then the bank that oh that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have the former real corporation get by law have directors authorized the bank account and so I thought oh\nMy goodness what happens if all this name has already been registered hound who have these duck but fortunately\nIt was in the form the corporation and and that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company was that two hundred twenty five thousand dollars and so I've become a big advocate of what we call customer base financing if\nWell you can go out and present an idea that people interesting enough you know they will they will have makes them the dance payments\nAnd ah when they do that they become a real advocate for you because they want you to succeed and they encourage their friends to buy the same thing\nAnd that so they become none equity investors they uh\nThey don't show up shareholders meetings and ask a difficult question they don't charge interest on their caches cetera so well I Would say for\nAn entrepreneur beak and the proof he can prove that markets validity by going out and getting advance payments from customers is solid situation\nAnd so what we learn from this and that was another rejection the McGovern had another one you had split the other thing that when they're giving you money to an eye on it and dance that sure puts the blame on to your but to make sure that whatever you make it better be darn good range\nUh or that I'm not real obligation perform or you know at the highest level of these people are expected\nYeah it's all responsibility we get back

a brutal for the Turkish government first point an accusatory fingering Saudi ruler\nThat alternative explanation is rogue operative took it upon themselves to carry out the murder of pressure on me

market showy\nWay with the shores you know he was somebody I was friendly with them is that we would have lunch together and chit chat you know not someone I Would have or to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was he was our guy not\nTo like what do you see happening there\nThe mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services uh the jerky boys likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledge that Jamal show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia at identified the person they're going to say is responsible he put it more initially and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and so lucky she this person intelligence\nAt the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition\nIs this person and tell just at the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible\nBut it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... well no one read me this troublesome praised in front of his lights go off and slaughter tons of back and can America the drawl it works in you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you\nWhat what is it works I mean you know for the\nGovernment to make do with a partial truth fairly often or the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish officials and all this been confirmed\nIt's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his were his reputation\nYou know he got pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover the rendition on bad in a cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession\nTwo elements there first of all I think this person this intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person is try to Brazil we tried in Saudi cord so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the crown prince uh you know in the\nPast a crown prince who came out of this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nIn speaking with Patrick guy mentioned his recent book into the hands of soldiers and then he'd been in the middle east correspondent for the New York times since he's well qualified to unravel the mysterious geopolitics of the region or conversation continues\nTo his changed crown prince ... consolidated power like male figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers and so the best handicapping if there is no one in a position to challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over that she's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have enough left to push him out a lot of succession as long as their dad is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago and she expected me with ambience when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the guy and this was just a range of ... have you been having a second option which is your responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one is you say someone was trying to take me out rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals an eye on improving the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that's what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend\nOf crop it's wrong but someone who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have that back to the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would uh the second defense be sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence\nTurkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did what they make sets in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence counterparts who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now and the impact that for example the war in Yemen this is actually weren't comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront the who these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary for corruption in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession or inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd bear arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller ... has a lot of friends and it's very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown princes with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley a keys enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and there are no outta helped diversify the Saudi economy\nAnd
