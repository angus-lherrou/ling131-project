socialistic system up there a free education universal healthcare\nOkay I don't I don't believe that for ... as as Sweden and Norway at that time had a free college education\nUh I I I Believe they do now but at that time a not so much look so you're absolutely correct I mean Martin Luther king believed in a he he was he was a political liberal at the time that he was alive\nAnd he believed in\nGovernment guarantees of medical care by the way so did Theodore Roosevelt when he ran for president Nineteen twelve is a progressive so to Harry Truman show actually introduced a bill\nThere there's a really terrific piece by a John Steele Gordon that appeared this month in in primary said fine publication of Hillsdale College and it it's a piece about how we got into this healthcare mess that we're in\nAnd look there are things that we can do is they can fix American health care without totally dismantling the entire structure but\nThey're also reasons why America has led the world in

simply look I'm a Magic Johnson is still very much alive and um I don't know how his Dodgers and I'm not sure there that much alive but that's different uh at the point about this is\nThere are reasons and I think the reasons have to do with these free market and the power of the free market that America really has led the world in a ... medical discoveries and in improving\nThe science of medicine over the last fifty years and yes I Do think that the profit motive has something to do with it\nFor the companies and and the medical institutions that are developing this material and these

him as the Unabomber I think this is a very good possibility of being resolved in the next few days to a week um and if not we'll know that perhaps the offender or offenders\nI Would I Would stick with one for now but if it's not solving a week or so I think we have a may have a little more sophistication here than we originally thought\nBut ah but we're not there yet enough that you know the law enforcement investigators know the level of investigation of sophistication on multiple levels we outside we're not quite sure what that is yet so we're still trying to learn\nUh-huh uh do you have some indication because I it's tough to get a straight answer on this uh where are these bombs for real could they've actually damaged or killed people or was this just a basically gangs\n[noise] well um we don't know yet I don't have any insight sources I wouldn't do that my\nMy brothers and sisters in law enforcement I mean I'm just really following what's in the media but I Do know from experience having work these case types of cases in my FBI days that are are there are a individuals who are just as happy putting a fake bomb out there one that looks very much authentic\nAnd when it goes to the bomb techs they look at it and they would tell me this happened at least three or four times in my career boy this thing is ready to go if only the person actually put a battery in it you know for the power so that they only had some sort of\nCombustible material or explosive material this thing was ready to go this would work so\nUh in our case so far of the uh I eat these improvised explosive devices that we've seen so far this week\nThese improvised explosive devices that we've seen so far this week\nUh none of them have detonated and that's a good thing\nUm and whether that's intentional on the part of the uh of the bomb maker or you know accidental and he really wish that they would have detonated we don't know that yet his purpose was and that's where I put on my behavioral ... micro finally got his purpose was to send a message\nA about our political system it's two weeks before a big big election oh that's not a coincidence I can assure you and quite frankly the message has gotten out there and the question is I'm\nA widow the message the question is who is the message sender and what is their true objective behind the placing an apparent mailing of these I eat these\nOkay when you say what is the message what messages he's trying to send because I'm not sure I understand\nYeah the message is clear that uh you know we we Republicans who can't even spell right or the name you know a show on a representative\nAh Debbie Wasserman Schultz as well as um rent I'm saying it will be the end missing from that to the you know we're not that bright and we ate these\nDams at the top of the food chain so much we're going to put this out and we'll show you what we really think so there's of course this person that that's really who he is you know a magnet wearing hats should against them semi detached garage somewhere building these at least I don't know about that a nine or ten devices at this point said over\nThe last few months and that's who he is or\nIs this something from a complete different perspective and this is actually somebody who has the um with her shirt on or something like that and I'm not talking about anybody high level this is somebody you know who just on his own decided to do something like this and make it look like\nA that are Republican was behind it because of course by default since all the devices are going to democratic either politicians a media sources or other people related to them an actor with deniro that's the that's the message that being said that you know we don't like your way of thinking we don't like your brand of politics so of course\nWho's going to Senate Republicans but it could be Michael I false flag type situation where it's actually like set up to make it look like it's a bad guy on one side of the political aisle when actually it's somebody on that same side who doesn't really want to hurt\nThe people who are getting these devices because quite frankly none of them have detonated but that's a but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one is that it is but I work cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and saying certain things and other political uh um incidents in another elections where\nOne side as there are people write to 'em you know the opponent by pretending they're on his are yet to the front pretending they're on his side sort of a mini false like type situation and let me just throw in your Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces or as in the Russians and some others a mess with the two thousand sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confusing compound the people involved and cause a little bit of mayhem and quite\nFrankly I'm getting makes America look bad and they I I and that's my aunt my wife is a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing and not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened and this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nOr do you think it's likely that we will have a PR or before the election I was twelve days from now [noise]\nI ... I I lost one word on you there I think if you set a resolution and the next four days or so\nI sent a perp a perpetrator\nOh yeah okay same thing um I think there's a very good possibility and I mean they there's a task force with at least a hundred people on it working this right now in multiple cities I Believe it's headquartered out of a New York my old version I worked there for seven years in

my country above any other nation in the world I Do\nAnd you know what what's amazing here is you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old she's a graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you dealt with Crimson Tide holes on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey tube and the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the wording national I like that I just don't think that's how this works and I don't think I think we're letting if I didn't do that I mean ... if you think you would think you are a nationalized then if that's what the definition of the word that you're using what'd you say you are one\nProbably not you know I Would I mean I don't I you know I someone who believes in in the United states and the important thing to say I'm not a national now that there was a national left out please come on I mean that term has not become

on the outs by NBC for ridiculous reasons we'll get to that but we begin today with all of the updates on the suspected attempted bombing attacks on Democrats across the country the weight it with regard to this spate of quote unquote attempted male bombing\nThat it is possible that the bombs themselves are not actually structure to detonate so I'll upon it over a hot air right judging by some ... by social media Glenn and a B story and thought it was claimed the explosive powder inside the bomb was harmless not so\nA package since CNN contained a pipe bomb in and on top of the mystery powder inside it's mystery pattern it's harmless the bombs themselves are supposedly workable and functional if crude although there are other reports that suggest\nThat the bombs lack the detonator and so this was either a test run or a hoax or something else like that we're still waiting more information and that is the key today\nAwaiting more information yesterday I said there were a bunch of folks who jumps to the false flag explanation\nNo I'm not claiming that you're not allowed to speculate inside your own head as to who you think of this or that you're not allowed to wonder whether there's enough information to get on one side of the other what I'm saying is if you want one hundred percent sure this is a false flag you went right there like right away he just wants to this is probably the Democrats hoping themselves\nThat's not good okay you shouldn't be using confirmation bias as a substitute for evidence and this is true in so many cases in our politics I Can't even tell you I've been saying this for years I mean I remember when with Michael Brown case Michael Brown black guy shot by a cop and\nEnormous swabs have left the entire lot basically said this is a case of police racism and brutality in which a man was shot in the back because he was black\nAnd I said well let's wait for more evidence and then the evidence came out and it turns out that wasn't the story do well here if you're jumping to either this is Democrats' helping themselves or this is Donald Trump planting bombs in the mailbox is over at CNN\nLet me suggest you that you're totally full of crap you know I Know you don't know yet no one knows yet I don't know yet you don't get depressed or know get an anybody's suggesting they know who did this or why it was done or what the connection is to any particular political party is wind to you they don't have the information yet\nNow there is some indicators that\nSomething we're just going on ... did this this\nPerson should be put in jail forever and the person who is doing this has now sent one of these packages to Robert Deniro I guess and I don't want to Maxine Waters and a picture of the of one of the bombs in imperial\nAppears to have a parody of an ISIS flag taken from a mean that was circulating on right when cars on the Internet than twenty fourteen according to NBC News the print that appears to truck parity flag there are places Arabic character with a silhouette a free woman high heeled in the middle and scripts and reading get her done which is a catch phrase of wary of the cable guy\nAnd we'd be sloppy Markey first noted the image that appeared inside the explosive package that the CNN time or building an address to Brennan or striking similarity the black and white flag of the terror group\nAnd then they can burn this was in fact in ISIS flag parity go this is leading people on the left you suggest that really what is it is a a right wing hopes and people on the rights justice is electing hopes and again\nOvertly and and systemically racist when he said that sort of stuff we felt like okay well you know is that an indication that maybe violence is okay there there are folks in New York felt that way people on the NYPD who felt that way that so much for the one bill de Blasio after winning the police for months actually went to a policeman funeral was shot to death members of the NYPD turn their back on him\nAnd they did the bar for evidence is Detroit nearly higher going to blame somebody for violence incitement you actually have to have evidence but the left doesn't care about

he's now blaming President Trump for this spate of attempted male bonding let's all remember CNN had not been particularly\nMeasured and its rhetoric with regard to the president of the United states or for guards at the right and folks on the left they look and then specifically because CNN has basically become a propaganda outlet in many ways for the anti propaganda\nBy Jeff Zucker says that when the bomb was on CNN headquarters and that's because of President Trump here is what Jeff Zucker said put out a statement\nHe said there was a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand that words matter that's part of that show no comprehension of that again\nI Do not understand why jet duck or things that the president of the United states is responsible for a bomb being that you know at a quarter is just because the president said that he doesn't like the ... by the press or the enemy of the people I don't like that language either I think that language is bad but then it's not language saying go send a bomb to the people at the end it\nDoes not affect\nThe president of the United states in response to the media basically joining up outrage at him and at the right\nIs I think not entirely inappropriate so first of all I Will say that\nPresident Trump has used rhetoric I don't like at all is used rhetoric that I think\nIt's immoral with regard to the press I think he has used rhetoric gotten his political opposition at an immoral does that mean again his inciting violence no and the press and he's very similar rhetoric about President Trump does that mean they are inciting violence no it doesn't heated rhetoric and violent rhetoric are not the same thing\nAnd to link the two means that eventually somebody just going to say what's that's where all the rhetoric because otherwise it's going to lead to violence there was President Trump going after the media basically the media and President Trump can't stop cooperating each other and\nThink there's some truth on both sides in there's a lot of alternate both factor is the president saying stop with the media scares\nThe media also has a responsibility to shed a civil town as you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nYou know I agree with the president at the media to a horrible job of covering it and in response to President Trump they promote even more and more bakery\nAnd more divisive politics is what they do but\nIs there any question that President Trump is rolling them of course not because President Trump has used similar rhetoric about me basically this is to folks slapping each other in the polling dynamite style in the face and then blame each other when a guy down the street decides you can go bomb the local school\nNot the same thing it's going to be ... I think much more correctly she says he and his choosing the Biden attack\nShe tweeted out President Trump asked Americans to come together into one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence many kind have no place in the usa you chose divide and attack America should unite against all political violence and that is\nCorrect that is correct and I don't understand why President Trump is getting back for saying the right thing at that at that rally or at the at the White House and then he is getting back on the other side when he when he goes after the media anyway in any case CNN demonstrating full scale\nThat they are going to go with this narrative that they never went with this narrative with ...\nAnd ... with his narrative with regard to the the attempted attack on trees in college but they are going to go full scale of these attacks on President Trump's here CNN's Laurie abortion or saying\nYou know Trump's targets in is it a coincidence President Trump attacked a bunch of people and then those people get ... bomb mailbox you know we do in politics we attack people on the other side and their and their idea\nI'd had people on the other side all the time now I mean I'm calling for a bombing of their house of course not and people who are attacking yeah mine are not calling for a bombing of my house but not a thing but here's glory border blaming from\nYou know ... these are names as you point out that come up all the time\nIn his rallies and then he's not particularly kind of a rock Obama either so ah I I think it it would behoove tend to be a little bit more complete and they say about this\nOn that are on on the attempted bombing and here is what they said this emily's an audio recording over the wire she says\nAnd the minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer and house minority leader\nPelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump\nIn a statement released Wednesday afternoon they're jointly condemned the statement from the president issued earlier in the day expressing his concerns over a series of suspected explosive devices to prominent democratic we listened with great interest of the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that can don't act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville and supporters rallies and get violent with protesters dictators around the world murders and all that it's been an affront to the free press and the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump's in a while that stop have I been unclear about this but you're actually going to blame him for ... bombings ... this is what you're going to do now I can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just a year and a half ago was asked\nSteve Scully nearly being shot to death he almost died okay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that he let here's Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could have been connected with\nThe guy going on to a baseball field and shouting anti gun down members of Congress about health care and food is doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while I'm kind of murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then you're not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual does something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all the sudden the sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's reverse I mean I Wonder what changed oh what changed his who was going to get one that's what you think that there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of hacking and blunt on one end directed toward you and drop on the other end directed toward your opponent\nWe don't recognize that what we're actually holding as a sort of use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you\nEvery sort has to legit but according to the left it's just a hatchet and you can bury it in between the shoulder blades have your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing they'll be former first lady senator presidential candidate she says listen as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nWas a person I'm rage as an American I'm worried I worry about the direction of our country\nI worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them when they're\nWhat kind of world will be waiting for them\nWhen they're seeing\nTeenagers and young adults and beyond okay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton saying this our top aide fleet brains who is really one of the most\nVicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit wished he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um vitriol\nOkay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office one day to Fox News studio then I guess when when Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil what the other side\nIs it legitimate like what's the date today today is the twenty fifth okay so what's your name at least twenty four ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullest of the craft in just one second\nBut first let's talk about what you do to get ready every evening I Love the dollar shave has everything I Need to look feeling smell my best very long you been more the fact I never have to go to a store and I think that stores you have to wait in line you have to find the product to deal with human\nYes he doesn't make you do any of those things and ... everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked and what I use like never run out here's how it works\nDollar shave has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for that you covered head to toe\nHair products skin face you name it they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically kicking stocked up on the product you use you determine what you want when you want it to the right at your door or a month to month once every six months I particularly like the ... the wasteful and keeps my skin\nSilky smooth I also really enjoy their black pepper and stage\nShampoo really smells good plus with their hands from discount the more you by the more you said right now I've got a bunch of stars that you can fry for five bucks like there are all haircut after that restock box ships regular size product and regular price so what are you waiting forget you're starting to set for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com slash Ben that dollar shave club dot com\nSlash then again ... everyone is full of crap including\nAndrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio both of them came out and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and has to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black and for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York for everyone who disagrees with my politics should get out of state is not in the graduation he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues\nLet me explain if you are sitting around today and they're going it's always the rhetoric on the other side this problem\nBy freaking near\n... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here everybody does\nAnd that also means that blaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is meetings weight worst country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric you're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up youre suggesting the other side of showing evil at the very ... of their idea is likely to lead to death and destruction\nThat isn't that an an American perspective on American Bernie Sanders into whatever the hell he want no matter how wrong he is and I must be is actively saying go shoot people on the congressional baseball field but it's not his fault and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants and you don't have to like it\nOr whatever Donald Trump says he has the right to say that so long as he is not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb some place right now\nIf I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all this really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation when I have to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does the crazy thing\nEnough is enough folks really really ... let's stop making the country worst place in other news\nNBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly blackface thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics to Megan Kelly we talked about the link yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross her party because when she was a kid people used to dark and their skin for Halloween costumes in wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks that well black ice has a long and in glorious history in the United states that's insensitive shit you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like after the end of the story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious racists they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believes that nobody actually believe that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and a black people are worse by people are morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believe that but NBC and it just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they've tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that it's not properly fitted for Megan Kelly may until it is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question and a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best\nThey try to fit her into the Katie Couric wop wop morning news routine and that didn't work for them and so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push out the door how are they doing that by\n... by actively stoking racial resentment than the United states is ugly stuff NBC News\nNow saying they're going to air taped episodes of making the show this week and if they're going to stick to terminate her contract based on her saying that\nShe didn't understand what the big deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume now\nDoes anyone really believe that the NBC brash has really upset about that or their boycott is on its way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism anyone actually think that no of course not to just NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd they the head of NBC News Andy lack openly ... into Kelly after she apologized she apologized and then lack that well there is no other way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then left her holds cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nAnd some NBC decided to eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient at it and no one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes NBC News unless they are preparing to chop somebody up and throw them in the whichever\nAnd that's basically what NBC is doing here I Wonder why nobody trust me I mean this this it really is a great media story of just how corrupt the media are", "show_name": "Michael
