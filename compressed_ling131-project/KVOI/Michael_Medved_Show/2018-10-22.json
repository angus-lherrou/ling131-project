think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential

shows that the election coming up in just Fifteen days from now no it's a yeah it's Fifteen days from now it's a tomorrow's Tuesday\nSo two weeks from tomorrow is election day and age going to be a series of very very close elections if you look at the the Trump Clinton election state after state after state was incredibly close\nUh most of those states that were incredibly close President Trump won Hillary also won some states that were amazingly close New Hampshire Nevada\nThat she won I'm at the point is we have close elections\nAnd that's exciting and there's a reason everybody should vote but you have full confidence that if you go out and vote your vote is going to be counted and it's going to be counted fairly and it's not going to be basically invalidated by all sorts of phony votes\nWell there's a new book that says you got to be concerned and the book is called fraud\nHow the left plans to steal the next election and you might just sort of throw this on the pile and say well this is nothing but actually it's a book by Eric eggers who is research director for the government accountability Institute\nAnd he's worked with Peter Schweitzer has been a frequent guest on this show on the Clinton Cash or extortion and secret empires which blew the lid off a different kind of corruption right now\nFraud is about vote fraud one of the most ... basic forms of fraud imaginable I Eric thanks very much for joining us and congratulations from the book\nHey thanks so much Michael it's great to be here\nOkay first of all we seen this in the New York times in the Washington Post time and time again there is no evidence that voter fraud has ever ever occurred\nCan you or I help people with a a little bits of evidence about some recent voter fraud that really made a difference\nWell absolutely and I think it's important to point out Michael cause you touched on this earlier about uh the idea of you know people have should that concerned with their vote count\nA real concern is that their vote will be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of illegal votes being hats and what you hear from the left is it voter fraud is just mentioned incredibly rare\nI certainly not have their scale to swing elections but that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible under inclusive curves are they defy it only as an intentional acts of impersonation\nBuying the legal voter are on behalf of illegal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote not should\nThat voter fraud or in the reality is that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting will just in Texas this week there was a story\nAbout the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration or with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check\nTo non citizen voters\nOr their blow in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight\nCounties in this country that have more registered voters\nThan citizens of illegal voting age ah it's been quite like that that nearly three million people are registered voter in more than one state that gee I where I work as part of the research\nWe did a national study and what we found Twenty one hundred is is a double voting in the state of Florida alone and Michael you remember that nearly four times the margin of victory of a presidential election this century\nSo clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest elections you noted a the ... election critics in how close that was\nA there was a very real problem enough one of the ...\nOkay do you um it it can you point to any specific elections where you do feel that evidence exists that the the result was tipped by fraudulent voting for instance I Know a lot of people look at the Al Franken or a Norm Coleman election back in the in two thousand and eight\nThat that's exactly right there were I think that the election it'd be unsettled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately with discovered more than a thousand go by spelling\nAnd people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way\nAl Franken went on to become the the the vote in the Senate so people ask what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a writer and insurance premiums because\nOff the voter fraud I Would say well look you're a writer insurance premiums because I'll forget it says it became the vote that lock in Obamacare are in New Hampshire in ... in New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that Democrats said New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of try to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one vote\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people register to vote on the same day and New Hampshire and they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts a neighboring state six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire resident\nSo those are a couple of recent example but um you know but but some of the other thing that happened I think\nThat document example you got the mayor's races you guys share three the sheriff rate in Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified\nOr that the judge the rule that well we have to give these selling due process though that's not enough evidence brought in holiday though it happened\nA nationally\nOkay would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because it really get down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida\nI've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the reality is biased to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities that I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean the the Texas Democrat mailing the the voter registration form is one example but\nYou know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Raul stop at many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I I Know one ... one of the things you're\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice now that's illegal but that happens a lot doesn't\nAbsolutely I mean there are nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court sided use that are that the twenty four million voter registration in this country are completely wrong so that's one in a way\nAbsolutely uh some cities are issue in this bill I uh I mean something even lie to vote with a gym membership right or credit card and have your picture I Know you're not like you have to have on the goodness driver's license ...\nAny day it seems to me that if we if we talk to start talking to people about getting IDs\nIt it's such a handicap for somebody not to have an ID because you can't cash a check and you can't I mean all kinds of stuff you can do\nSo if you're actually helping people by giving them IDs at the same time that you're requiring ideas for voting doesn't that help precisely the victims groups that uh we're supposed to be protecting\nIt does except for when it enables I think um they're like he's like Chicago and San Francisco the municipal id up but then the problem is is that I think it creates a little bit of confusion because there you've got a lot of illegal immigrants would go to get his life and\nThen they are actually allowed to vote with those that eating certain local elections\nOh I I say yeah a lot of them are there are there are so many there's so many problems that are raised

Republicans who want to create jobs and Democrats who've been creating mobs listen\nDon't like being called an angry mob but really that's what they become they've gone so far left\nThey can't even believe that they're over there they don't know what's going on when you listen to Eric Holder talking about kicking may go low we ... or Hillary Clinton saying what you said which was so horrible\nHillary Clinton saying what she said which was so horrible you cannot be civil they just don't see it Maxine Waters constantly day in and day out ranting and raving [noise]\nThey're losing it and they shouldn't be we should be a unified country it'll happen some day\nOkay um how's it going to happen I I I Do think that right now at this moment with\nAll of the campaign ads that are out there some of them so very hateful it's unlikely at two weeks before a very very tight election that all of a sudden people are going to come together maybe after the election\nParticularly particularly if Republicans can actually hold on and maintain a slender my majority in the house of representatives because of all this is going to lose some seats in the house they're forty Republicans who retired this year and some of those seats are going to be lost\nBut honestly it looks more and more like if you go out and vote\nWherever you happen to live it's so important\nBecause it just a handful of votes can make a difference in each congressional district let's go to your calls in a two Keith in San Francisco case here on the Michael ...\nHey Michael great star to your show I've been struck by people commenting why is Beto O'Rourke willing to move so far left in a state like Texas and drug supposing that fact with his\nPhenomenal fundraising haul of thirty two or thirty six million dollars in small thirty aviation yeah largely\nSo what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly and and I in my view was Warren\nUm effectively disqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't agree with you\nBut I think he could be very charismatic and you could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and ... is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nNo he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he ruled out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he had said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now\nAnd he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it he is for impeachment he he believes even before the Mueller investigation has wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish it needs to fish but doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call\nUm [noise] I I'm a\nI Will get back to this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will

Republicans are good at things\nNow what what's really happening here is that the Democratic math is often Democrats are garbage and everything basically when President Trump is the second thing in the news that has a very good thing for Republicans when he was the first thing in the news it's a problem so when Democrats spend weeks\nDemonstrating they don't care about due process and that they will railroaded by simply for political reasons\nVery good for Republicans when the lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republicans when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIs the insanity of the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're seeing it back to the very good economy on the Republicans the margin by which voters press Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling results like ARPA Seventeen in this poll which is amazing also\nI don't want to give no credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good things number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the presidents of the United states does make it feel like he has a change actor\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the polls show is that Republicans are actually seen as a party of change well being the party in power it's really unusual usually the party out of power it's you know the party of change because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat has very good for Republicans here is what the latest polls show according to Wall Street journal voter interest in the mid term elections has searched for records within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll\nFindings point to an energized widespread\nBuffet by dynamics that brings great uncertainty to the outcome of an election just two weeks away and what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nNow the reason for that is because largely and the Democrats\nThe Democrats were always going to be energized to vote against President Trump but now Republicans are are really mobilized vote against the Democrats I Know that my interest in voting\n[laughter]\n\n\nTrying to save your office and not ... made all these are actual vetoes [laughter]\n\n\nThere you are so I Can't imagine why Republicans are responding the way that they are except for Democrats again the theme of today show Democrats terrible at everything coming up when I say the\nDemocratic Party seems a little bit out of touch and maybe they don't have their feet on

and protect these days are general cause you have Cortez [laughter]\n\nKnow when we talk about at the central threat to the last time we had a really major existential threat to the country was around World War two so she knows nothing about history there was an entire Cold War that existed for several decades after World War two it turns out that until we been here before and we have a blueprint and doing this before right when we bomb the German\nAnd don't don't stop her she's rolling does none of these things are new ideas what we had was next to central Britain the context of a war we had a direct threat to the central part with another nation this time it was not Germany an accident or supposedly made the United states as an enemy as an enemy\nHistory lessons with Alexandra ... some of my favorite history lesson at a direct exit central threat with another nation this time it was not Germany and access\nNot act bodies right okay you mean the axis powers oh that's what you mean\nAnd what we did was we chose to mobilize our entire economy industrialized our entire economy we put hundreds of thousands if not millions of people to work in defending our shores and defending

should be free movement of labor not citizenship you shouldn't be able to come in the United states and I'm a citizen and vote and shouldn't be able to get taxpayer dollars but if you want to come here at work I really don't have a huge problem with it but\nEven I libertarian on immigration believe that we ought to have actual bores in the United states meeting defensible board if you don't just get the crops are boring because you want to cross our borders a country without boring is not actually a country\nThis caravan issue with a serious issue does according to the Associated Press this morning a going around in a hundred migrants\nShrimp or southern Mexico on Sunday heading towards the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents briefly block them at the watermelon border they're working help at every turn for sympathetic Mexican whopper food water and clothing hundreds of locals driving pickup dancing cargo truck stop them to let them clamber aboard Bessie Shockley Lopez\nOn during the city of San Pedro Sula heritage stuck polar bear in the winter cap that seem to add a place in the tropical heat it's the only way for two daughters four year old Victoria and three year old Elizabeth ... beside her women with sweat\nBut then I have sympathy for folks want to escape crappy places to come for a better life that doesn't mean the United states had an obligation to take an anyone who wants to get in without any sort of vetting procedures or determination is whether this person is going to help the country or not\nOr out of out of some sort of a sympathy for the folks crossing the border you cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth taking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without betting that without any sort of skill set that does not make for good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny both on the way they love Norway they looked at market lost weight and\nImmigration restriction that have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have it on social estate in terms of redistribution of wealth when you have an underclass that it's coming that does not have a skill set\nAnd one of one of the things about about those ... in the northern country and Scandinavian country is that they basically banned immigration\nWell the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want on open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social spending like never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on his even Lindsey Graham was a real dumb on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously\nOf the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration form even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy Pelosi would welcome these tournaments I don't know what happened to Lindsey Graham whether we bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham you point out the reach that is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina Nancy Pelosi will welcome these Caribbean\nYou want to be the country of people that run you up and down the hall and spit on you\nOr do you want to be a country of a of of of Republicans who can actually deliver for working families out there that will put good judges on the court that will stand up to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome the caravan fear a Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not out of lack of sympathy because a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the issue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubble and what poll shows that Democrats have park you'll Republican friends than Republicans have Democrat print\nBecause Democrats live in areas\nActually she Republicans ... human beings and so they won't even talk to them they actually believe that it's mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country\nActually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate\nAnd not only that that if a man calls himself a woman that that man is than a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering\nAn attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually set to hear the headline from the New York times today at the transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it\nSounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGender just for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that had one is that what's actually happening no that's not what's actually happening because that that he ought it and nobody is saying there are people who are transgender what the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law laws that have to do with sex\nFrom the ministry ... saying is that under the law laws that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different sex so when the civil rights act was written\nAnd it included language about men and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that it affects discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman and you say that's not cool we're\nNot going to do that that's not the same thing as saying a woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination and that's that's what the Trump Administration is saying they're saying that behavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's not what they're doing\nThe media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because there used to even acknowledge the fact that there is such thing as biological sex it's only self defeating what the what the ... the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is sex\nAnd so generous act I completely separate you can be a man but your gender is female and\nThat makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think it's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breaches kinda tough

a Trump Administration when we're just going to disappear the transgender now\nKnow that is not what they're doing here is what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNot what the what is that if they've redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the ... is what the hell everyone's talking about really I mean that because sometimes when people in general what they mean is expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean is actual sex\nAnd it is impossible to tell which unless they actually specify and then they shifted definition based on what they want their point to me that the what is really the one making the case it only to dinner they're saying that if you're a feminine and you're actually woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually in that\nIf you wanted to find gender as ... express characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means it's meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say that gender has to do with biology\nNow you have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosome than X chromosome now they're intersects people and they're very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can you bully genetically male and female\nAll of this technological sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency are logic to the transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their terms\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman who won the Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman if my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone would half a brain on planet earth knows that\nBut here is what the New York times says\nSeries of decisions by the Obama administration losing the legal concepts of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth personal sex assigned at birth the dumbest term in the world it was a gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even that sentence you can see the terminology shifting\nRight there's gender and then their sex assigned at birth\nYou don't assigned a sex at birth babies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not find her girl\nYou know was signed her girl genetics God that\nWas sort of baked in you know I Know she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born you know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow this was difficult and it turns out he is in fact the boy amazing coincidence he comes out and he has all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing almost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted fights over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept\nConservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times and service especially evangelical Christians weren't sense this is a way of slandering religious people will make it\nIt's not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that want our main women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's group\nAnd the same thing for bathroom no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in the Jesus it's those people the people if it weren't for those crazies leaving the Jesus then it would then everything would be fine and we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage him well\nHere's the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing with tremendous ration that\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex\nUnder title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that the government agencies needed to adopt and explicit and uniform definition of gender is determined on a biological basis and it's clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition would define sex as he's a male or female on changeable and determined by the generals a person is born with according to a draft review by the time any dispute about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world is that not just basic rationality if you clean your woman I should be able to objectively tell whether your woman or not it shouldn't be up and it shouldn't be up to you to decide\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same left that has now come around to Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American because not ... well she's actually isn't that American why isn't she Native Americans you should be why not just more Native American and Caitlin generous woman so what exactly is the problem here",
