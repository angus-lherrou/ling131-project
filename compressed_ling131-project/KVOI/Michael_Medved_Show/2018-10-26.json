sixteen or say out\nHad posted numerous photos on his Facebook page showing him wearing a red at that had the magic words on it make America great again\nThis is one of the reasons that I think that people who assume that this was some kind of false flag operation okay this is a real guy with a real criminal record\nAnd a long long history of supporting right wing causes them I save supporting right wing causes if he maintained a Facebook account and it says he stopped posting on Facebook in October of two thousand sixteen right before Trump's victory\nBut his last posting was a series of

because this is such a pro military movie okay I'll say it from the outset\nThere's actually a good piece we have in our newsletter that we sent out a concerning the director\nYoung director for this movie it's called hunter killer the director's name as Donovan marsh and he actually spent four days\nOn board or a U.S nuclear sub a hunter killer submarine like the one that has depicted in the film\nThe basic set of the film is this is the movie begins with a terrible terrible accident or is it an accident involving an American submarine\nAnd its American submarine that because of the heightened tensions with the movie recognizes between us and Russia is up near a Russian naval base\nAnd so then the uh the leaders of the U.S military including Gary Oldman who plays the head of the joint chiefs of staff\nRecruit a an extraordinary but inexperienced camp than played by Gerard Butler who has to come run a secret mission to try to see if\nHe can figure out what has happened to this missing sub and oh yeah incidentally rescue the Russian President the movie sounds like this\nSauce recipe military buildup in Russia\nI mean when I come\nMe wish for\nHalf a freshman read to has\nRead different parts of the car we rescue\nOkay and you might recognize the voice of common was actually a very good actor or who known as a hip hop artist common uh plays a one of the I think he's chief of naval operations in the film\nI look at the movie starts out and it's kind of corny that the first time you meet the Gerard Butler character before they helicopter him in for this ultra secret mission\nHe's out in the middle of Norway a hunting elk\nAnd uh it's okay it's nice looking spectacular but once this film gets going and you get into the plot\nIt's based on a novel that was written by real life submarine commander it co written by him and\nIt's almost plausible because it's based upon political instability in\nRussia and an attempted coup and basically because this us submarine is up there near the naval base where they have taken the president it's actually up to a un American submarine and for navy seals to try to rescue the president of Russia\nGreg town that we

has come out with a statement he was of course yesterday his bombing his intended bomb had been identified and Robert Deniro of course came out with a statement saying the only way to answer their bombs is to answer it with our votes\nAt it that it seems to me is very glib but it's very dangerous because it's not their bonds ... that I have heard no one repeat no one ... and I don't care how far right you go or what kind of crazy or not ... nobody who applauds these bombs\nThis is one guy and I think yes he is deplorable in every way\nBut he is in no way representative of the people who support President Trump\nAnd he certainly isn't representative of President Trump one of the things that was upsetting to me was looking at the photograph in detail of his van\nI at one point in one of the windows in his van very bottom the window he has this he says uh I Am Donald Trump and I approve this message well the president has made a very very clear he does not approve this message\nAnd that's appropriate uh Christopher Wray the director of the FBI appointed by president Donald Trump to replace James Comey when he was gone\nChristopher Wray was there at the press conference just moments ago it's about a half hour ago and he had this to say about the scope of the investigation just concluded\nAs the attorney general as confirmed we have arrested sees are say are\nIn connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive\nWhat I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Marilyn for the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we guy including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division and our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nOkay and then he concluded Chris\nIn Quantico okay and then he concluded Christopher way right on this point a lot of people said what's the big deal well this is the big deal\nWe can confirm that Thirteen or ... percent of various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy so reaction to heat shock were friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks that the guy left based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that so she's are saying\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected for pieces of two different varieties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nOkay uh that basically lays out how this was done and uh it's it's very important it seems to me\nTo understand for people on the left\nWho have been trying to see the acts of this uh evil mad man\nAnd he has both evil and he clearly as a madman he's also a total loser will go over his arrest record coming up it's bad that takes almost a segment on its own because he has an extensive and prolific arrest record including a prior arrests record for threatening to blow people up with bombs\nAre there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and the point over here is I Would just\nTry to get folks on on the left including I I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is a little reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump present\nCan you imagine anyone celebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it\nAnd for conservatives and I mean we would feel horrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when Steve ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer at the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd killed Steve ...\nAnd and maybe we can sink in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number I'm let us go

the authorities have indeed arrested a suspect in the alleged attempted bombing of various democratic officials and media figures around the country\nThe guy fifty six years old he's identified as a Native American Trump supporter now this is why it was so stupid are so many on the right to immediately leap to falls flat\nAnd I don't mean asking questions I mean we've been to fall flat suggesting without any evidence this must be a false flag attack that this must be some sort of democratic operation the most obvious explanation for a person sending a bunch of bombs you highly public officials is that the the crazy person and now that turns out the person is indeed a crazy person\nOnline records show that this guy has a criminal record and his own company is called Native American catering and vending as well as proud native America one low price dry cleaning his body builder and he said to have been trained by DNA and phone records was flagged as they come back after making previous terror threats to judge it so presumably\nThis is all President Trump's and fall photos have emerged within that links this guy to pro Trump anti Hillary Clinton thicker here's what the pictures look like for those who can't see the van is plaster plastered with pro Trump material\nIt's just a bizarre band like you saw this on the street you would think you're absolutely crazy person there's an inverse proportion between the number of the between the number of bumper stickers on your car and your sanity more bumper stickers on your car the more clearly we can assume that you're crazy person so that means that this guy is a complete nut job\nObviously if you just want than you would say the guys complain that job or you won't have to know anything else about him\nAnd then it's also the craziest bumper sticker it's such a CNN sucks up bumper stickers it's pictures of President Trump and Mike Pence is Hillary Clinton with a target over her face at the same thing was banned Jones and the target over his face it the meaning of President Trump riding a tank with explosions in the background\nThere's a there's a bumper sticker on the top you soccer recruits for Trump which I don't even know what the hell that's close to me you know I always got to figure that it would be a soccer supporter who's going to be responsible for something like that shocker I Can't believe that somebody with this van is\nIs sending bombs to people that's crazy now the media immediately jumped exactly where you think they would jump which as\nThe guy isn't crazy he was a perfectly rational saying human being until President Trump came along unfortunately for that this will be live by all available evidence that this person has been arrested some ten times he was arrested back in two thousand to ... attempted bombing threat\nPrevent presumably I guess that was President Trump's ball back when he was on The Apprentice or something and that's the take of the media today\nLaw enforcement officials covered that white man it was covered in photos as I say Donald Trump and Mike Pence and had at least one sector referring to Hillary Clinton here's a little bit of tape from CBS News covering all of this the FBI covering the band so all of that is our number than it\nLooks like a in the same location where a they're in a restaurant or at least there's a lot of activity and and I wonder you know what's interesting um guys and again I'm Sorry I'm Alan ... and ... and that's something the U.S I'm just noticing that they're called the FBI the picture that you're looking at right now is absolutely\nOkay what's amazing is that when Democrats are actually reminded of violent rhetoric used by Democrats in the past and they get very very angry and this is the part where the one sided innocent the media is creating more volatile political climate coming up as I had left really do not like to be reminded that overheated rhetoric is fairly common on both sides and we have the\nVisual and audio evidence of that right there in Haiti tour of MSNBC getting very very upset when she was reminded that Democrats are fond of using overheated rhetoric as well maybe media bias
