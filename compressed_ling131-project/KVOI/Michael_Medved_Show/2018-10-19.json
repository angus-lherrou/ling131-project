worse\nIs one of the best movies ever made period is a great film I think the same is true the Nokia or maybe fantasia\nOkay that that they these are amazing artistic achievements are just amazing film and they have everything going for them and the idea that they are now being criticized now let me just say there are aspects of these films that are badly David where political\nCorrectness has actually lead to some corrections I mean I'll give you an example a lot of people may not know this but I've actually seen the original form of fantasia\nAnd fantasia for those who don't know it's a movie made by the Disney people and won't was very personally involved because he loved classical music and he loved this film and this film took great classical pieces of the boss prelude and few indie minor and Easter Vinci rite of spring and Beethoven's passed around symphony\nAnd it created sort of cartoon animated uh bringing the film bringing in music to life and it's quite interesting\nIn the past around symphony section or they went to ancient Greece and they are dealing with guns and ... and ... and ... centers are Half Men half wars\nAnd they had one really offensive little scent or who was black and ... and was ... and\nI honestly I'm not making this up this was in the original movie and at the time I guess it was considered funny but it's profoundly offensive and racist and you'll pardon me I'm not endorsing it I think they did the right thing to take it out of the film but they had this little black central are shining the ... of the\nOf the other centers and it it detracted\nFrom the movie and it was horrible and they changed it but I I don't believe the kissing\nSnow White houses that\nAnd by the way when I was mentioning cure a nightly criticizing

Cinderella weights around for a rich guy to rescue her don't rescue yourself obviously and she added this is the one I'm quite annoyed about because I really liked the film but Little Mermaid I mean the songs are great but do not give up your voice\nFor a man hello\nOh okay I I agree there are some and I've written about this I mean I think that that part of what I've found problematic in little little mermaid which is a wonderful film\nWas a the idea of the kids know best which is a very regular theme and a lot of films for children that parents are daughter and foolish and ridiculous and should be taken for granted but okay ... kids can still love the movie\nAnd I don't think we should have a problem with it\nNor do I think that suggesting that people might take names that can be comfortably written now that don't have to be spelled and sounded down look one of the tough things about the name ... that is I before I knew how to read and write you know us three I had learned what's your name\nIs Michael med vet and what's that\nMedford no Michael Melville no it's meant that any DVD and you learn when you're a little kid and you have a name that's a little bit more

and get people and their face and restaurants\nWhich I think Iraq we led to the shooting of that guy at the baseball field you don't make that evil and the person that said that is an evil\nOkay while you're at it as a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces\nIt seemed waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the matter is that\nA lot for the all along anyway I don't I don't know for years okay you're having admitted it 'cause I was like OK cowardly to admit it\nYou don't know probably on that I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think that even with that little girl that that comes from politicians politicians are we even do that now you know God's now\nYou know God's now as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things that politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that ah they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think it's profoundly wrong but cheap we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that uh Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you can argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that that people had an and there were people of this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent\nMillions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to Stalin so that he could beat Hitler answer\nThere is

do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office in the way he interacts with people\nIt's reassuring it's that sort of different portrayal than what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and you of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors and the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff and are they all these stories a White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicating the book\nBut Trump as a person who likes to actually have differing views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I liked them I I mean I like Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around these actually can very gracious these very charming and\nOur attentive uh he would like to put two or three people on the table with district or disagreeing positions you know and we do get out many sort of make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does\nAh so you know so a lot of their job shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... you don't want to be surrounded by a bunch of yes and and I think that's a that's a good thing\nAbout Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on this one thing is that Michael when you said that I got to be coming along what I did I think your understanding this I this is a full fledged boom or on right now you know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was you know I've never were from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine and I ... in between\nEverywhere I go all I see is in our office in Seattle I saw when I see it San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and uh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just a friend's everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories\nWarehouses biggest construction boom in the history of this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it is for investment money that's coming in to the United states uh we're ... you know every time I Do your show I like the you know I'm ... another statistic uh first of all we got them\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we they the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border and that caravan I'd let me let me go to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald\nTrump ally ally ... and I\nYou know and that and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way out but you know why that was right\nYeah because people couldn't get jobs or don't have a ... year yeah so\nThe real reliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came into the United states so\nYou know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know uh but they but it is a sign that in my incidentally you and I agree and that we need a lot more legal immigrants in this country we need more\nPeople on the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I've told you this you know it and it's in the book\nWe used to say if you're going to build that wall Donald make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nAh the book is called Trump's ... inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Honduran flags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we thought a and I'm I'm watching all these people I Know there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually up this year so we got the biggest tax cuts in three years and we actually have a slight increase Rob is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues that put people at work at a business as profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah like the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for that\nYou like a President Trump's a idea a vast along every department to five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do you\nKnow that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your age and that's what businesses did during the recession they\nTalked in their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul and the show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and\nThat that isn't the structure really we need pipelines we need luck Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be good to be done with\nPrivate money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nWe are blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences\nPeacefully in the end\nWe must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nIt's beautifully said I'm thanking Nikki Haley speaking last night the Al Smith dinner will come back to that meanwhile a quick word from relief factor really factor is a natural dietary supplement you're not talking about any chemicals or any drugs of any kind of know side effects either\nIt's a something you just take a every morning you take it with some water and you'll take three

Trump race would just be the great ... the\nFirst question in a debate would be which one of these slept with Stormy Daniels more times like that would be an actual question in a presidential debate and I'm all for it I mean we're there man let's embrace embrace the hurricane embrace the suck like let's just do this thing Michael I have an idea here's what he had to say about Hillary Clinton in his article and political he says\nIf I was running I could see certain circumstances in which you can be helpful for morality perspective in certain locations on a limited basis\nJust to say like stay away Hillary stay far far away and I think there's still a lot of people that support her and for that reason she could certainly play a positive role in some capacity in once he's wanting\nThis is like the question in a job interview where they ask you to name your worst quality and you're desperately trying to think of your worst quality and then they say the name of the things about Hillary Clinton is like\nMaybe she'd be good at like standing there sometimes\nSo that's pretty great but that is not just waiting anybody in the Hillary Clinton camp from thinking that maybe she starts to Felipe range is just a jerk so if a week brands have been known for years legitimately two decade and Hillary's fix or anything nasty guy and he attacked opponents with a prominent ...\nHere's what he said about Hillary Clinton he says trucking the walk up to her being a failed candidate isn't over simplification nope\nBoy to change the dynamic when girls are playing I based on I have a daughter and I played very very differently when boys go to a girls only go to the changes that I doubt it boys are different than girls radical feminist want to have it both ways boys and

girls are different also we live in a free country and because we live in a free country people should be able to rise and fall on their own merit without cleaning victimization at the hands of the

let's talk some commonsense\n\n\nWelcome back to the bench Shapiro shows the president of the United states that do it as a performer that'd be the joker a smoker midnight poker President Trump loves being in front of an audience and basically his shtick in a comedy routine which has its upside and its downsides let the president doesn't rally like President Obama would go out and make some speech the president goes out there and he just rich for an hour\nAnd it's usually very entertaining in a lot of folks have been to President Trump's rally they say it's a lot of fun obviously the crowded there and a half of the time it really is kind of half a political rally in half a comedy routine because from that I highly entertaining human\nWell sometimes that has upside and sometimes that has downsides because like all comedians when President Trump gets a refund sometimes the risk is good and sometimes he is just going to put his foot so far down his mouth and it comes out his call in and out his rear end and back around again sometimes he created an Aurora boroughs of human physicality\nSo here's the good sometimes the president do stuff like it's like this is kind of money so President Trump there is a woman in the crowd and she shouts I Love you and here's President Trump's response\nWise guys the Democrats if turns I Love you too [noise]\nWho said that [noise]\nIt's finally a woman you know I get it from the middle [laughter] every guy that said I Love you they're just not my thought [laughter] I finally earned it from a woman thank you\nI think that's funny though that money and stuff and then when you break that down all its 'cause he likes it and if you got any funny okay that's a funny thing to say that the funny thing is that the problem is because the president is actually a performer\nDonald Trump they performing you spent his entire like being a performer as someone who performs on stage I Know what it's like you play to the crowd the credits in front of you respond with cheers and their response lose their time with laughter and you're constantly trying to keep them ...\nPresident Trump even said this when he was a candidate Trump he would say that he go to a rally and if he was on his stump speech and his three quarters of the way through speech and people look for you would just start saying build the wall because it got people all jazz felt like he actually said that he performs like performer well the problem is when you perform like before the president\nDoesn't actually have a fully functional brain to mount filter that filter is is pretty ... hey whatever start here ends up here\nAnd it doesn't matter what started there is one of the ... is one of the good things about the president's why he's authentic why people like authenticity in politics\nThe written his authentic feeling is because he's authentic in the same way that my four and a half year old is authentic she thinks that it comes out that's the way it is like there's no pre ...\nThat's good in politics because it's honest right you get the feeling that he's on an even like even the stuff that Trump said that it's dishonest heels honest because he actually believe that he will say that Trump is just going out there and he's lying for barricaded\nDonald Trump believes everything with Donald Trump said that doesn't mean everything with Donald Trump said is right or actual but it is that that's the good side from the problem is\nSometimes the thoughts that go through the head and not come out in the mail\nAnd that happened yesterday um twice actually so he was talking about Greg ... who is the ... in Montana congressman and a and I guess in Fort was at this rally\nAnd the president decide you know it'd be a great idea to praise that time the congressman gene for body slammed reporter so if you'll recall back in twenty sixteen campaign there was a situation in which airport confronted raging for like two nights before the election and Jennifer got mad and he went full\nMacho man Randy Savage on it\nRight when Bo undertaker he like grabbed him by the neck and he slammed into the ground and this was caught on tape and then he had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor\nPresident Trump thinks you know what I'm In front of a crowd I've done WWE before let's talk about this thing you know this is an issue that really needs to be out on the table two years later let's do this so here's President Trump's new or is that a smiling as because this is the world we have chosen this is the business we have chosen a time in ... and we're here we can't go back\nInstead of them doing that the direction they go is you know what this is just like the Saudi Arabian government\nThat just took a guy in the Istanbul consulate killed him chopped up his body and then look we'll fight it when he says the ... the body slammed that's probably that's that type of attitude that led the Saudis to believe that they could murder a journalist\nI'm not making this up this is what members of media say now because the numbers the media are insane and respond so let's say Trump said something that is one hundred percent stupid and then the members of the Democratic party and the media come back and say something that is for a hundred percent stupid folks on the right go see from ... from printed them\nIt's been Trump is really good at figuring them\nWell I don't think it's actual genius\nI always attributes stupidity what I cannot attribute some Alan\nAnd I think what we're watching as President Trump just saying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things in response to do I think that the President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think are crazy and he drives them crazy and he's good at at poking them but\nThey have a unique capacity to pull his chest knocked out of the fire he'll say something\nAnd then the media overreaction so insane that you go well I guess I can say with those people here to CNN CNN host drawing a comparison in link between President Trump praising ... and the murder of democracy ... by the Saudi Arabian government\nDo you have to be to make this link Saudi Arabian government has been murdering people since you know their entire existence they've been murdering dissidents and journalists for literally decades\nBut it was only ... we're just going to know all his own firm came around ... this is the practice so annoyed about the media yes Trump's as bad things I guess what the world is also a rough bad place before President Trump was born and before he was president world in and start spinning the moment the trust President Trump was elected their CNN hosts know trying to attribute the spike\nIn treatment of bad journalists in places like Saudi Arabia to Trump and the from his dictator of Saudi Arabia\nAt that rally last night will play for the president praised\nThe body slamming I Need a guy who can do a body slamming like that so why does it matter while you might think that it's all being a journalist in any circumstance is bad but remember this happens three weeks after the apparent murder in this member of Washington Post journalist\nYour mall to shock and the president we should note acknowledged that it certainly looks like this columnist is dead at the same time he refuses to condemn the Saudi regime for the ...\nOkay so if you think that President Trump is okay with the murder of a journalist because he says something stupid about Greg ... you know and if you think the President Trump is suddenly driving has members around the world to be killed you can sit like the Russian government needed a cue from us\nLike I don't remember this sort of talk about President Obama when journalists were being killed all around the world under his watch and journals were legitimately being till around the world under his watch but because he didn't say this kind of public stopped there was no linkage well there's still a linkage\nAnd he didn't say this kind of public stop there was no linkage well there's still a linkage but Trump says dumb things\nIs the obvious you know answer to do all of it that the worst example this came courtesy of walking Castro one of the Castro brothers who once I guess who wants to run for president walking is just the other all the other one and nobody cares about that much and he was on CNN\nAnd he suggested that President Trump's administration had literally Greenland the murder of ... by the Saudi Arabian government\nAnd then he was kind of using Gen forte\nComment as as evidence of this let me go to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting the jury parishioner\nMay have with U.S intelligence delivered a shit list for enemies with to the ground for the NBA or in Saudi Arabia and that the print them may have acted on that and one of the people that he actually goes on in the strictest soldier\nThat didn't happen Jared Kushner did not and they hit list to the Saudi Arabian government and tell them to go murder journalists there is no evidence of this and I like how Joaquin Castro says there's a rumor going around there's a rumor going around the Joaquin Castro just member of babies and eats them in his backyard I'd have to provide any evidence for this rover is just a rumor I heard it\nAround and ... this is why Trump will continue to win so long as people do not treat him with the proper level of objectivity and by the way objectivity does not mean moral center when he says bad stuff that means that if you respond like a duck to his comments than doubled down on you do in a second\nWe're going to get to more of all of this but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like usa why would you buy a generic mattress do for somebody else\nHe would sleep built to sleep with it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sweet preference is to the perfect metric whether you're aside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but with the ... there's no more guessing and no more confusion\nJust go to Hugh ... dot com slash Shapiro think there are two minutes liquids and they will match huge will mattress they'll give you the best sweep of your life for couples you can even split that mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and feel preferences\nFor each side you have a ten year warranty you have to try out for a hundred nights were sprayed right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress or what do you have to lose to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would flee dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I we

comfortable and luxury mattress and a non luxury price that he would sleep dot com slash a pure over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or once again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro use that slash Shapiro's and they always say you already so\nMeanwhile as the media continue to wildly overreacting blame President Trump for the murder of a Saudi journalist I Would like to make one note about this particular topic okay when it comes to the murder of the Saudi journalist a couple of things one\nPeople who are most loudly criticizing President Trump for his treatment of the Saudi Government or people who were absolutely in the pocket of the Iranian its members of the the former Obama administration who want in the middle east to be controlled by an Iranian had drawn spreading its power from Afghanistan in the east to Lebanon in the west and south Yemen\nIs Obama characters who are saying that Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United states now should there be serious consequences\nTo an allies murder of a journalist of course there should be but I'm not gonna take\nAt face value the complaints from turkey an actual despotism that has arrested a hundred and fifty thousand dissidents in the last two and a half years\nI'm not going to take at face value their complaints about human rights and I'm not going to take at face value complains about human rights from bunch of people were propped up and gave a billions of dollars to the worst human rights violators and dictatorship on planet earth outside of North Korea I'm not going to do that\nSo two things can be for one don't lower journalist and there should be consequences and also that doesn't mean that we have an ... that we in the United states have an interest in undermining an alliance with the Saudi Arabians on behalf of the Iranian the way that the Obama administration wanted to do\nOkay you know what I I Can't handle the most just mailed back which is a male that's okay but you know too much to art now that got Joe said\nHey Ben who do you think is the favorite to win the dumb at twenty twenty democratic nomination in addition horse and people you think Trump would be handling election or some people you think he would struggle debate thanks I Love the show okay so in the category of people he would be handling Cory Booker\nHe would mess up Cory Booker right far to cast would go down harder than a journalist in the hands of ... the president would say\nCory Booker is mechanical an awful awful at his job he is a he posed as a moderate and he actually radical leftists\nAnd he like Hillary Clinton he's actually like a bad version of a robot is not even like a good like he wants to Allison from Terminator is like the early version that's passed out a lot it kind of broke down on the battlefield he's he's more like gizmo from some of those old series he he's he's not\nYou can you can see every gives hurting for Cory Booker\nA band was there a data shops at Trump would finishing because Booker is the most authentic candidates and Hillary Clinton just terrible candidate I think that Trump would also want somebody like Eric Garcetti the LA mayor who pretends to be cool but it's actually just adore so I think Trump would would destroy him pretty quickly um I think that the most dangerous candidate for him\nWould have been Elizabeth Warren if she didn't implode because like frankly I thought it was a lot smarter politically than she is\nAnd I was shocked to watch her set herself on fire sending smoke signals to the rest of the world that you didn't know what she was doing\nAnd she just sat there and center TB on fire and I didn't understand why she would do that but she's kind of taken herself out of the smart candidate circle I Would say right now of the top democratic contenders most dangerous is still Biden because it's hard to destroy a guy who's been in the public eye that long\nYeah well one of the benefits that Trump has is that everybody has an opinion on it which means nothing that you say about him changes anybody's mind\nIf you say that Donald Trump is bad with women everybody goes right when you yep okay have you seen Donald Trump says things sometimes that are really bad no more like well yeah we've been here we know\nAnd if you say that Donald Trump shot amount on Fifth Avenue we'd all be like some kind of probably okay he he really is right that was the truth thing from ...\n... in high name recognition and a history of skeletons in your closet means that it's very difficult to actually destroy somebody politically\nIf they've dealt with a skeleton in their closet and obviously that it go Joe Biden has been out there for a long time there's not a lot out there that isn't known about Joe Biden and they can dangerous also he does have blue collar appeal and a lot of states that Trump won places like Ohio and Michigan in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania\nThat is sort of Biden territory democratically speaking to bind would be dangerous candidate so when Trump says he wants Biden I I don't think that's right Kamala Harris I have yet to see\nSo Kamala she is much better at this ripping the Cory Booker is she also happens to be somebody her downside is that she has this kind of\nAbsolutely clean clean as the driven snow image in a lot of the public mind that she's just a prosecutor hardness prosecutor asking the tough questions I think when people start digging into clean characters in politics they don't stay clean for long and President Trump is a master of throwing dirt on people's hands he was just great at it so I I think he would there okay against", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "19"}
