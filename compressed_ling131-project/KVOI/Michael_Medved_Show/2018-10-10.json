Lauer not exactly a conservative\nI mean really lets 'em\nOr go to Suzanne in Philadelphia Suzanne you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHey Michael how are you I'm doing well\nI I actually think that the Democrats um\nI tend to plan propaganda it's great for Republicans it's gone to low back at it says a lot of women are now are how how how it's actually after the cabinet hero and her husband son brothers and they're looking at this saying this is a ridiculous\nYeah I I certainly hope so because the one thing and and by the way I Know everybody here has conversations with family and friends\nFor people who are afraid I'd ask them what exactly they're afraid of and they'll say well we're afraid that roe v Wade will be overturned what you don't want\nIt doesn't roe v Wade being overturned doesn't change anything all it does is set up fifty different battles and fifty different states in the union about the extent to which abortion will be a regulated and that that's basically it and this is one of the points of Bobby Jindal made\nWhich is this notion that abortion is all or nothing either every single abortion is allowed under all circumstances and you have no right to interfere with abortion at all which is the position right now the Democratic\nParty more uh people think either that or all abortions will be illegal and they'll start executing wanna try to get abortions it there's no one is advocating that and and again it's also I think in the legal terms I think that the the spring\nWell I think in legal terms I think that the the sprinkler it will be more flexible in allowing states to regulate abortions just like abortions are regulated in European countries no Sweden Denmark Norway\nBut ah the idea that every single abortion is going to suddenly become outlawed\nThat's not going to happen and there are no politicians that I Know of who believe that that should be the case or let us go to a hole in Los Angeles Paul you're on the Michael ...\nYes I like like you know and I don't well Kevin Kevin against abortion right the anti abortion\nRights is not that's not a position for a judge\nOr a judge on at work you\nKnow conservative politicians are anti abortion without question but he is not a conservative politician he's a judge and I hate to break this to you but the constitution is silent on abortion\nOr can you mentioned to me all all the either ... or descriptions of abortion policy in the U.S constitution\n\nI Know I Can't thank God he's Republican dominated\nOkay but that's by people that that's by people who are elected right\nOkay and what not by judges what's that like for the wire fortunate\nOkay when you say side for look as state the state of California gets to decide how to regulate medical procedures in California\nAnd if you think that the state of California is going to outlaw abortion\nThen you must be living in a fantasy state like in one of these dystopian novels I don't I don't think that's going to happen\nWhat can happen across the country is waiting periods is in other words the idea that abortion should be permitted in some circumstances doesn't mean the government should be morally neutral on the issue of abortion\nDo you think it's a justified inappropriate Paul for the government to do whatever it can to discourage abortion\n[noise] I think the government should the bedroom and that way they decide\nOkay most most things that happen in the bedroom don't include abortions right\nAnd again I I\nDo you think that the government should stay out of the ah that that bedroom with a closed door or that allegedly\nInvolved three teenagers back in Nineteen eighty two and both as the Maryland or someplace nearby\nSo again it's it's worth Christie it's worth recalling some of that because when I went to high school in the sixties uh they had rules I girls were not permitted to wear pants to school and no genes no pans of any kind in the skirts had to be a certain length and this is public high school\nSo yeah we people should put this in historical perspective quick word from relief factor this came in from Susan in Plano, Texas\nI suffer with pain all up and down my leg for Thirty years and it cut off from work or out I was desperate and I will find something that would help them pay when I heard about the quick start program or order\nA laser loyal and help our

the bench if you're a show so we now have a real gas lighting attempt in fact Democrats openly stating that my politics are okay and the media suggesting that Democrats have said no such thing and there's no such thing as the Democratic take for example dominance a dominant last night\nHe had um a GOP commentator and Alice Stewart and she was talking about President Trump was ripping on Democrats as an angry left him up\nAnd you're it how it went down to London that is so so Alice Stewart said that call themselves a mob was actually accurate pointing to people who are banging on the doors to the Supreme Court wrapped in a cruise and Heidi cruise as well as yelling and Jeff Flake confusing talent in elevators and lemons that but that doesn't mean people don't get to object\nThat you're right it's Americans object it's covered in the first amendment it's like the first one\nAnd then Lewis again chimed in and argue that anti cabinet protesters in ... which they get they went into the actual cabinet Senate hearing room and they screened until they were removed\nThey shouted until they were called my behavior okay so let me and said no that's not my behavior it's people who are upset and they're angry with the way the country is doing\nThose two things are not mutually exclusive mobs typically are angry and upset with the way country is going\nThe region the media are trying to cover for all this because the media are beginning to realize that shouting at Republicans not actually the best strategy for winning and so they're simply going to try to convince you that the person was shouting in your ear is not real like Harvey the bunny\nBonny just imaginary to exist on your imagination\nNot a real thing so media doing their best to try and tamped down\nYour perception of the public that Trump is actually correct about all that and the Republicans are right when they said Mitch McConnell course pushing this more McConnell says listen this behavior and the Hillary Clinton comments about civility being out of balance is unhinged stuff from the Democrats and then of course is correct\nNo pays until I got there what more days on end tactics\nApparently this is the love rallying cry\nBut fortunately the American people know that they ... free politics oh hey fear and intimidation or not how we actually govern and our democratic Republican\nWell this is right I mean the Democrats acting like drought children is not going to help them and that's why the media trying to convince you that not actually what's going on Rand Paul got himself\nIn a little bit of Twitter hot water yesterday or comments that he made a better exactly correct he said that political assassinations could rise in the United states somebody could be held\nThanks to all of the violent rhetoric on the articles like Hillary Clinton now wasn't I'm somebody go back and listen to condemn it sort of aggressive rhetoric from President Trump's been twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen the presidents of the United states when he was just a candidate when he was going to rally in saying something like punch somebody you know pay your legal bills when\nHe was doing that sort of stuff like that that bad that ugly he shouldn't be doing it well Democrats are the ones doing it today\nAnd justice that it's just as bad end up being more explicit about it too I mean when Hillary Clinton that civility is not required with anybody on the other side of the aisle it's pretty damn explicit\nRand Paul says this sort of stuff is going to get somebody killed I mean that Hillary Clinton is going to get somebody killed by the rise in temperature is likely to reach the boiling point at some point here Rand says that he gets all sort of flat all sorts of lab for it\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those were racks up thing getting their face we have to realize they bear some responsibility of this ...\nNow people are saying well what about Trump what about from okay let's talk about ran for a second it's random one is making the comment Rand Paul had six of his ribs broken by a neighbor who allegedly didn't like his politics and literally just tackled him on his property\nRequiring months and months of recovery Rand Paul also happen to be one of the people president at the congressional baseball game where a bunch of Congress people were shot at and these college was nearly murder\nAlso many perhaps most big ticket items used by a typical American family on a daily basis have decreased in price\nAnd they they look at the ... human progress they look at the prices of common household items advertised in the Nineteen Seventy nine years catalog and prices of those common household items sold by Walmart and twenty Fifteen\nRemember those products and twenty fifth hell of a lot better than the product in Nineteen Seventy nine a washing machine making twenty fifth you need a better quality washing machine and a washing machine made in Nineteen Seventy nine a car made today is a better car than a car made in Nineteen Seventy nine\nAll the products are getting are better and you're getting them for cheaper here is what they did they divided the Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal prices\nBy two thousand Fifteen an average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time cost of household items in each year that's a number of hours it would take\nTo buy a washing machine for example so for example that time cost me Thirteen cubic foot refrigerator fell by ... percent in terms of the hours of work require at the average hourly nominal way so if you could buy two refrigerators for the price of one that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say about price productions greatly underestimate the totality of welfare again by the average American ignoring qualitative is that an environmental improvement I'm commonly used item again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear it is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off anywhere in the Nineteen seventies\nSo where are we short or short in education healthcare and helping because the cost of those things has written at a faster pace in total compensation however it is true that today's houses are larger and healthcare is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part and major city the Reagan easy housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling city in in the country and that's where I live is because of heavy regulation and toning\nSo what is the standard of living well it's certainly\nIt certainly better than it was Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in her apartment is bigger the average house is better than average stuff do you have in that house is better\nAll of that should suggest that maybe we should be grateful for the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision\nDemocrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats get Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but if you in ... when you wake up sleeping giant it's not good for your poorly is not good for you okay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats\nFor you okay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth in what they're saying now about justice cabinet but first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nYou would sleep now to sweep place they had two minutes to complete a use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference as to the perfect metric\nWhether you're aside sleeper or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from but was he like there's no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes liquid and they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor couples he looks can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and your preferences for each side\nAnd a ten year warranty and you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all ... after a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looks weak dot com slash Shapiro as he looks weak dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or her again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nMy wife and I had a he looks sleep mattress we took that sleep quickly ordered the mattress it came in the mail it's just fantastic so good we got one for my sister for her wedding go check it out right now he likes sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the west doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country and that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your lead you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent now things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states of America pretty safe country for women in fact it's the free and safest country for women in the history of mankind so there's that but\nThere's a song it's now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook I'm not sure what her name is Mercedes when I got a and she just put up the song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault\nWe should not be concerned about it anymore so young men who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of this which is two things can be drawn women can be afraid of bad men and\nMen can be afraid of bad women why these two things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid\nWhen a man of cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has a right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of you know should be equivalent or that the level of prevalence of these events is equivalent\nBut to say that I shouldn't be afraid something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on
