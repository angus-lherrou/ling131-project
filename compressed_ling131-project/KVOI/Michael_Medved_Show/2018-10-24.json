how did uh some of the harsh rhetoric by Eric Holder or by Hillary Clinton or by anyone else on the left contribute to it no one asked that\nAnd that is a double standard when I'm Talking about is just very quickly this um attacks that occurred or three days ago\nWhere a guy named George ... was thirty eight years old\nAttacked a Fox Fox five television now again I understand Fox five is not the same as Fox News but in the eyes of the general public you see Fox of talks and if you're on the left you hate it\nIn any case through to pains of glassy came into the lobby and then he was shot by a security guard that anybody say well he must have been a left wing or turns out he\nWasn't a left wing or he was in out of his had her he was a crazy homeless person and somebody who had been charged with murder in two thousand and two but was released\nHe was involuntarily committed in two thousand Fifteen he placed a death threats against D.C police and the D.C offices remain human resources and against a federal judge dismissed one of his many law suits you had more than twenty four lawsuits\nIn recent years claiming that he had been controlled by a microchip implanted in his head\nUh so I don't know left wing or right winger know crazy person is it entirely possible\nThat these are bombs that were sent out to people could be such a person or is it just reasonable in any phase of the imagination\nTo jump to the conclusion that big cause there are a lot of left wing targets here people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Holder and President Obama and president of a and a President Clinton and Secretary Clinton because those are targets apparently this attempt\nIt must be someone was inspired by President Trump and President Trump is to blame\nThat seems to me outrageous and unfair you want to hear an example of it or Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York right after he gave a decent statement praising the police raising a bomb plot than this\nReasonably sprays and bumps on than this\nThe heated rhetoric that toxic environment\nIs part of this yes we are being on a full investigation whatever a suggestion of the pattern is that they are for literally a related and I think that's a caution to all political officials elected officials candidates\nAnd Americans we can have political differences we've always had political differences that's what made America America but let's have our political differences with civility\nA and let's avoid the hostility and the rhetoric and the rancor and the anger\nBecause we are out of boiling point\nOkay I think there are a lot of Americans who are the\nBoiling point and I agree with the general settle sentiment that it's better to have reason conversation but for goodness sake what a hypocrite\nAnd why now and why is it that there was rice and which is deadly that was delivered to President Trump at the beginning of this month the same rice and was also delivered a general matter the secretary of defense\nOr did that get the same kind of attention here\nThere seems to be just as much damage that was done by that attack as this one namely none or is there media\nManipulation going on with the coverage of this event\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six it seems to me that there is a ... the New York times and their initial coverage of the attack on this Fox News station that was an attack would damage property at least in one guy with a bullet in his chest\nOr\nThey ah said the shooting at the station comes almost four months this was in the New York times the day after the shooting of the station comes almost four months after ... for the newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland and opened fire with a shotgun the chilling attack killed five people left the world of journalism really\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ souls burgers at in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was nachos divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a doubt that when Steve school lease\nWas severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded designed to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman that was\nPolitically motivated the guy was clear about it\nBut listen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after Steve ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nWe have her son is for most of us in sync looting signs race about Israel like rhetoric of the last thing in some ways\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHad their they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all of a sudden these sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't even go into president the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you so again I I that's got there another day but since you asked\nHow could they possibly say such as\nPart of the way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nMy own guess is most likely this is a not like the person at that Fox News attack\nBut God willing we will find out and find out soon I certainly hope before the election uh meanwhile a quick word from relief factor relief factor is a natural way of dealing with pain\nSomething that has no side effects no risks involved at all it's just made

more news on the caravan but we begin today with the breaking news that a bunch of bombs have been sent to various democratic figures around the country\nAll of this of course is abysmal disgusting or if it whoever's doing that should be arrested they should be tried and they should go to jail for the rest of their lives\nThat this is just an awful awful thing and what's amazing is that if you say that publicly there's a group of people will immediately suggest that it's a false flag attack or that depending on the target of these sorts of bombs that okay which suggests to me that there is a collective\nAs sort of collective mental illnesses falling across as a small but significant group of people who believe that the other side is so evil that everything up to and including sending pipe bombs in the mail to them is justified which is just to say that means that we have a sickness in our society that needs to be\nEradicated a mental fitness in our society that needs to be eradicated\nThere's a story from ABC News explosive devices address to Hillary Clinton's home when the house of former president ... intercept at the time or a center that it's home to CNN in New York City was evacuated after suspicious package that apparently looks like a pipe bomb was sent there it's just vicious package was also received at the New York city office of governor Andrew Cuomo sources told ABC News\nWhich should narrow it down a little bit of towns like this is probably somebody from New York state they're sending it to Andrew Cuomo as opposed to say governor Jerry Brown in California investigators are working to determine whether the two devices address to Clinton and Obama are connected to a pipe bomb town earlier this week in the home of mailbox\nA billionaire George Soros near where the Clinton's lead in chapel clock New York ... believes that all three devices are similar pipe bomb south instruction now immediate jumped by folks on the left was to suggest that this was a right wing or who have left wing or is it has been inspired by President Trump\nAs I've said four years now I despise when people blame individual acts of violence or attempted violence on generalized political rhetoric unless you're actively calling for violence into and takes you up on that offer are not responsible for the violence the action of people who take you\nTo to the ultimate extreme in terms of violence so for example when he Bernie Sanders supporter wasn't shot up a congressional baseball game and nearly killed\nThe house majority whip and the media covered it for all the Fifteen minutes I didn't blame Bernie Sanders because I wasn't Bernie Sanders this fall\nA winning kind of fringe member\nOf black lives matter shot up police officers in Dallas a couple of years ago right after Brock Obama had made speeches condemning police officers and probably gracious I didn't say that that was Brock Obama's fault wasn't brought about his father was an act of evil on the part of a person who was actually evil or mentally ill or both\nAnd that had nothing to do with rock Obama's words I think you can raise the temperature in society and do serious damage to the society because you've written the temperature of that site but I'm not going to attribute individual acts of violence and evil to individual political viewpoint unless those viewpoints are actively calling for violence and to do anything less\nOkay I mean that is about a ... state when you can make about another human being as possible and this guy who says that he wants a new kind of

nationalism are no exception Mazie Hirono Center for Hawaii when President Trump said that he's a national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist one anti Semite\nWe should stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he means when he refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just dog whistles by this boulevard it's racism is basically for many people as a um anti Semitic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay Mazie my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when the president says nationalism\nI'm not hearing nothing you saying that he prioritize the United states is worst security over the human rights of people trying to make their way across the board you may disagree with that but there is no way that has anything to do with racism or anti Semitism but just became the actual talking point across left yesterday\nJim Acosta CNN and waiting to find you somebody who loves you like him a cost of loved Simpson can Acosta here is going to cost us saying well maybe when President Trump says national if he means white nationalist\nOkay or maybe when Jim Acosta says stuff I just think that he's an idiot here's Jim Acosta\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on and Medicare rent without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Costa I don't think anyone or that people ask whether the president has announcing when he when he says things like we should protect our borders and nationalism\nMean flash back to ... thousand five saying exactly the same thing in the ... actually said right here's Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse of the nation die there he was saying exactly the same thing Donald Trump\nOr a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour in for the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again I guess at rock bottom a way back when was that sort of white nationalist\nAlso you know being half white I guess that he was white nationalist as well it wasn't just Democrats who at this point basically everything that he says we practice with your diary because he says all of the quiet stuff out that it was all for anything is Peter out that are more objective journalism being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial the dizzying phobic this is something that the president and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism nationalism I don't think the national wasn't alone is enough I think there are tied to bind that it has a history of culture but\nWhat actually make the United states the United states is the ... idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution and backed by two thousand years of Judeo Christian History or rather three thousand years Judeo Christian History and that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique\nData unique idea in world history come not such a big fan either of the president using nationalistic language but\nYou suggest as white supremacy is anything but again this comes back in the basic idea you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the the the ... of people on the other side\nAnd it's very much the same thing as an anti Semitic culture for centuries where people would put on a hook nosed and they and they put on a fake belly and currently sidewalks and then they would suggest that they were Jewish right I mean it it's the same sort of thing like dressing up their culture to mock that culture is disgusting unacceptable actually racist\nNow is that will make until he wasn't guessing\nThis is where we get into the issue of assuming people's motives\nHere's my opinion on people darkening their face for costumes like that\nI agree that it's inappropriate specifically because of the past and I think that it is fair for people to look at this sort of thing and be sensitive about it but I think it would also be worthwhile to recognize there is a difference between being ignorant slash racially insensitive and being racist\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting that black people should be ...\nNo one was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in your in any way in fact and making Kelly was ... that may be why people want to dress up as some famous black people because they admire those famous black people that is not the same thing as people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMe that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of ... or a mockery\nBut I also think there's a difference between enough rap like going to a party and a little girl who decides that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and she puts on TALK make up\nBecause I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference and notice it tempt missing from the motives in our society is really gross Megan Kelly is not a racist and making it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst at worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the history of blackface and the impact and still has on black folks in the United states\nThat's the worst and but there is no way to make it until he was actually suggesting it's okay to mock black people\nThat is not what was happening and yet there is CNN's Don Lemon suggesting that Megan Kelly actually is a racist because there's never been a time when black face was acceptable first of all he doesn't know where she lives you know what kind of party she went to like download it doesn't do that\nSo it isn't just an isn't making Kelly was racist when she was seven years old because you dress up as Diana Ross and black interface for it\nI Would suggest to download and doesn't really know what he's talking about\nYou may know what he's talking about historically with regard to black face but again there's a difference between darkening your face for a costume to praise and African American person and darkening your face you mock African American people\nAnd again I've said several times in the segment I still don't think they should do it to praise African American people specifically because they're too many black folks are going to look at that and say well maybe your mocking you needed to really here doing that is because you're mocking me out of sensitivity you shouldn't do that\nBut the attempt to immediately attribute the worst available motive Megan Kelly is really telling and it says something about the nastiness of our politics right now\n... forty seven years old she's always there has never been any time in her forty seven years that blackface has been acceptable um there were all white people on that now there were no African Americans know people have\nAre all white people on that now there were no African Americans know people of color there to say hey Megan not cool\nHey so this is this is really really absurd you know again\nIt's it's been taking blackface seriously it's fine but that's a company that does not I'll give you an example you want to you know you wonder how we should deal with these issues really how we should deal with these issues and same with Jamie Fox deals with these issues and Jamie Fox\nWas ... you know it is obviously an incredibly prominent black man in the United states has made lots of money as a musician is an actor very talented guy ... is very close friends with Robert Downey junior a few years ago he did a pod casting Joe Rogan and\nIn the middle of the podcast the question of Robert Downey junior actually putting on black face for the movie Tropic Thunder came up Robert Downey junior was nominated for best supporting actor Oscar and there is no way by the way that even\nYeah I think what most Tropic Thunder made maybe ten years ago eight years ago maybe eight years ago in any case there is no way that movie get made even today because of the great sensitivity around identity politics but here is Jamie Fox is perfectly decent\nExplanation of Robert Downey junior and how he feels about all this\nPeople have to understand where it comes from there are real people that that really mean you'll ...\nLike outside of us I mean there's some real people who really don't like whatever you are whether you're black you why do you straight you're gay whatever it is there's some people really don't want we're\nIn the payment and it's easy were easy target\nOkay so when when Jamie Fox suggest you have to know where it's coming from there is some people who are bad out there who don't like you are Robert Downey junior is not one of those people why don't we start thinking of each other as people who probably could be friends if we would stop treating each other like garbage\nAnd Megan Kelly is not going to a party dressed in blackface my black people and it's kind of amazing how certain people get away with this sort of stuff because everybody as soon as the best motives on their part to for example\nTom Hanks in two thousand four was at a fundraiser and that that fundraiser there was a comedian who got out of him as one freight and he was actually making jokes about wearing black nature and he's actually dark in this day and he was wearing a fright way\nAnd Tom Hanks was cool with that\nAnd the controversy lasted about five minutes because Tom Hanks and listen that never should have happened it was inappropriate I don't know what's going on there I understand people were offended everybody said right Tom Hanks dozens of race as we know he didn't mean to ... people we know that he's not interested in taking in in somehow hurting black people and everybody got on with their lives\nBut because we are interested in right now and what can we can people for the wall over that makes for the worst available country the worst version of ourselves\nAnd that has to stop when we're talking about making Kelly or whether we are talking about President Trump or whether we're talking about the the attempt to nail people on the other side of the aisle an inverse\nOkay I'm going to talk a little bit more about this plus I Want

doesn't mean that that'd be awesome and killed is actually sending these bombs and means that somebody is probably fall and by doing exactly that okay so\nI Want to talk a little bit about a little bit more about you know where we are as a society and how we how we care all of this\nAgain we need to start with the premise that the people that we are talking about generally do not have harm in mind that their goal is not to destroy us in any way if we figure that then we can have normal elections yes brought you the elections but we're not going to be trying to kill each other because we can assume that\nMost people in the United states grew up in the same dealt with the same guy says when we did\nAnd they did I mean the reality is that we all grew up in the same million our values are not all that different even the most right wing members of the United states and most likely members in the United states here radically agree on certain basic values like freedom of speech and hurting each other compassionate land decently\nAnd why because we all grew up in the same side when you're up in the same society you share a certain level of baseline ... now I think that splitting I think that's one of the problems of the country but one of the waste that's what is exacerbated by simply assuming the political disagreement reflects underlying character differences now speaking of political disagreement and\nYou know the polarization of our politics\nThat social fabric those common values I say are being split and you're seeing it in in some of these democratic campaign one of those campaigns from Stacey Adams used the Georgia gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats and she was caught on tape talking about free markets here's what she had to say\n[laughter] [laughter] [noise]\nFigure [laughter]\nYou're free market [laughter]\n... and you can't hear you saying the free market has never solves any problems in the medical field which is obviously on through your baseline root issues in American politics I think Stacey Abrams is therefore lacking character no I don't think she just wrong I think she's wrong and she doesn't know enough about economics and she's misinterpreting the economics that she does now\nBut she had bad person I don't know stadiums probably not\nEven though they you know there's tape of her I I Believe now burning a flag back in college so I guess we have now ripping directly from script written by Aaron Sorkin like we're actually just going to do the American president all over again with safety Abrams I've noticed as weird trend in the news the last couple of days like there was there's they moved to Boston plane that landed on the one oh one north\nLike I like not that far from where we filmed this\nAnd all I can say is thank God for the are asked\nBecause the royal Airforce really took care of business making sure the ... and the men in the high capital is coming true that's exciting\nAnd apparently Stacey Abrams is directly from the American president and then there was a story that I saw today that the guy who looks exactly like David swimmer\nRobbing a liquor store and and robbing a beer so Ross from friends has been cut loose and President Trump is the president Donald Trump the president of the United states will you know Scott Scott Adams the guidance as native living in a simulation I'm starting to maybe believe that we're just living inside we're we're we're in script but in any case", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "24"}
