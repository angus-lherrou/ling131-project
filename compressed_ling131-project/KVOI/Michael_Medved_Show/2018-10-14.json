going to be discussing here shortly as again please give us a call\nI'm going to talk a little bit now about some various aspects of sue small a type of operations that may enhanced or each of us are during the weeks to come as well as a presently around your home\nIn one of those carpeting it'd be carpenter bees yeah those aren't individuals out there so to speak that are have hammers and nails and things of that nature but they do have a pretty good set of jobs and they do like to borrow holes or in what products\nI Do have 'em around my home they buzz around periodically\nOr they don't seem to be dangerous from any standpoint that I Know a except they like to borrow holes in your would products that you may have\nSo the question is how do we get rid of 'em are we handle them from that standpoint so you'll be able to find her holes\nThey're pretty good size or anywhere from ... and a half inch in diameter or they do like the bugs they do borrow tunnels or in all sorts of what products hanging around the house or they are very a testy from that standpoint\nHouse or they are very a testy from that standpoint other good way to identify them if you happen to have them you'll see a little piles of sawdust on various aspects where they may be accomplishing their borrowing one way\nOr just see if they are one of his on the inside of him as you get a little squirt bottle or if you have any syringe like an oil syringe or\nAny other type of syringe loaded up with a ... alcohol which is the same alcohol that we used to a rub your body down to cool it off for the and septic for an injury you may have but if you do put it on a little injury make sure that uh you have a month for over your voice\nBecause you're going to be screaming loud as the burning takes effect so if it affects us like that you can imagine what it's going to affect your carpet intervene\nAnd almost guarantee you that are you gonna or terminate the life of that carbon it'd be carpeting or be and you will not have them around your home any longer\nOr they do like outdoor furniture citing based boards facial boards up porches beams that are on the outside uh from that standpoint it will take care of them quickly or if you want to repair the damage that would after it's all over west since you're going to have the big hole there\nAre one good thing to do is to get some diet tenacious earth and you may wonder where are you going to buy that well I guess you could get it out in the ... out in the desert someplace I don't know any place where that would be but diet diminishes earth is a filtering a earth that is used in swimming pools\nAre two three ways that they filter the water and the swimming pool would be one with dire tenacious earth which is a very fine a filtering system in another would be San and the other would be through a bunch of ah filters\nAre that are changed periodically but diet to measure deserves is where you can get it at any swimming pool company\nOr that or would handle that from that standpoint and probably some small quantities if you go to a one of the home centers of that nature ace hardware that cetera so after you do that that will help 'em\nA repair the the whole itself to a certain extent and then you can see a little hole with talking\nUh I Do not recommend using and acrylic based talking\nBecause that'll dry out in time and a crack at it maybe pop back out I Would recommend are using one hundred percent silicone copying which will have an expansion capabilities contraction is back ... an expansion capabilities and fill that hole for you\nNeedles hanging around your carpeting and anything that you may have underneath as to try to protect it from that standpoint\nThe shortest life as far as needles go would be the spruce is\nAnd there's probably several more out there up from that standpoint forget that some consideration as far as are providing the love\nOf freshness or a long lasting type tree\nOr you may want to think about which has been a long time standing that I've known about and watching my mom and dad prepare the trees as you cut off of certain a piece of the bottom of the tree to expose some of the raw would\nAh that has not been callous because it's been setting out and being dry\nFrom that standpoint\nOr you may want to trim up some of the branches and so you can put the proper tree standing underneath it\nAnd then in many of the tree stands you may have to drill a little quarter inch hole in the center of it there that so it holds the a pig that comes out of the tree stand that will prevent the tree from moving to and fro back and forth et cetera et cetera\nThen as is anchored in position and something else I just found out that is rather interesting that you may want to drill a couple half inch holes are\nNot necessarily so close to the uh support hole but um maybe deep up into the ah stock of the tree and then a stuffed with cotton balls\nOr then when you have that are packed with cotton balls and you put it into your tri stand and your for your water into the tri stand at south\nUh with that the cotton balls will ... just like cotton clothing does as an example it seems like you've got the bottom of my my past sweat and Jesus wet all the way up to my thighs and how that all happened and why I didn't have an ... an accident or anything like that but\nA pot and there's a very good working source and so um are caught and close as an example so\nSince gotten closer made from cotton balls maybe Pima cotton would be the best type of caught and you can get a hold of and step up into the bottom of the tree in order to provide the wiki mechanism or to keep water a deep up into the ... a bottom trunk of the Christmas tree\nSo we'll have helped to absorb a water and keep it in a much a fresher position also when you put it in your home or try to put it in a coup is part of your house\nSo maybe keep her away from the windows if it has a a west or south or a glass windows available which are going to be extremely warm even in the cold temperature\nAs the a temperature wicks right through your your glass system obviously insulated glasses are better protector of that than single paying last\nUh keep it away from the sunlight which would be keep it away from the windows from that standpoint and you'll probably have a a tree that will last a throughout the Christmas I'm\nA period of time if you buy a live Potter tree and you plan on planning and afterwards or keep wet towels around the root ball\nOr that and also keep them moist again that's like\nA drilling up into the base of the tree and putting a cotton balls up in their stuffing it with cotton you keep the moisture around a ball of the tree itself and that will hopefully prevent it from drying out due to the cotton cloth that you're going to be rapid are wrapping it with\nA again a keep it away from heat keep it away for windows and keep it away from drafts or air as we know that the one Arab passes over us our body as an example and you've got some a sweat beads on it that you feel a cooling effect\nWell it's also going to dry out or a tree when a draft is a purported right across the trees system itself\nSo some ideas for Chris this period of time and will be may be talking more about that as time goes on if anybody else has any further questions\nAh clients are another important thing if you don't have a the availability or the funds maybe to buy big steel class are getting rather expensive these days you can sure make modeled hardwood as well as out of bowls\nAre depending anti upon the type of clamp that you want I'm not going to go into any great length but you are of construction of them are could get to be to tedious and complicated over the radio but if you want to come down to the store\nOr talk to us about matter of fact in your own ... or you can go on line and probably look at homemade clams from that standpoint\nUm a lot of spare hard winter around uh you you could probably buy or pick up the unfortunately pallets are not made with them anymore but I Would not recommend using a soft wood\nUh when we talk about hardwood again I remember that there are soft characteristics of hardwood as well as hard characteristics of hard was so be careful with what hard would you do by boat getting maple or in some of those words would be the hardest that you'd be able to\nPurchase\nIf you're glowing some a corner joints or things like that you may want to think about the tourniquet approach and that is that you could wrap the a box or the area that has some corners and uh and uh tightened it up a bike twisting it tire not in one end of it are tired\nLike get a sticker something a broom handles and twisted around and that'll tightened up and get you a a very good a tourniquet type clamp St process that will use when you're going to use a tourniquet on the human body\nOr the other thing you may want to use is the ratchet straps that we use for time merchandiser items down in the back of pickup trucks or just in the back of any a process any vehicle that we're going to transport stuff with so that's another way of getting clams especially around collapse\nAnd one thing that ah many of us have not seen in a long period of time is when Lehman flooring first came out and they did not have the self locking systems\nLemon flying first came out and they did not have the self locking systems upon limited flooring they actually use ratchet straps in order to hold together because all the joints were glued so or ... or an excellent plan from that nature\n\nOkay let's go to talk about little critters at our prehistoric critters\nAnd it looks like we're coming up upon our break to enter the finish the
