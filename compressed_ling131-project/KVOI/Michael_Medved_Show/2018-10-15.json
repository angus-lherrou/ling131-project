back in a worse than ever but we begin today with the greatest story of the last several weeks Elizabeth Warren has come forth with her proof or proof\nThat using the Native American Well Elizabeth Warren today decided that she would engage in the most humiliating cell phone I have ever seen in American politics\nI mean this is like ... own of all time but this is a really bad owned gold my goodness so we have to travel back in time what time it was with Lauren claim that she was in fact Native American she said that she had high Cherokee cheekbones she suggested\nA in a recipe book called powwow child I kid you not that she was a Native American and the recipes you submitted to ... a recipe again I could you not for a crab bit because clearly that was something the Cherokees made back in the day crab bit noted crab herds\nOf the Oklahoma planes to her ancestors used to hunt was more into this story over and over about her Native American ancestry and what she said was that there are racist members of her family couldn't except for parents romance because her mom was partially Native American here's Elizabeth Warren telling the romantic story\nActually if you haven't wrong about what it is I Believe was listed on the air so okay my mom and dad all were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married\nAnd my father's parents said absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee issues for Delaware and oh after fighting as long as they cook my parents went off they Lowe\nOkay so our parents are low because her mom was part Cherokee and Delaware\nWhich means you would think pretty hefty dose of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if if her family is worried about it then it sounds like that would be significant Native American ancestry\nSo President Trump didn't believe this because it's nonsense that people actually checking her background they found there is no Native American ancestry anywhere in the in the time horizon of rationality\nSo President Trump went out on the campaign trail this is back in twenty Seventeen I Believe and who's holding a rally in Montana and he suggested that you would give her a million dollars if you can prove or Native American ancestry\nAnd we want to say\nDollars for your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test of the shows your your

Confederate leader incredible now you think well that bad stuff you'd probably shouldn't call it Confederate leader incredible but here is what President Trump actually set about robbery and we heard

don't care what probably as you guys are women and his name was grant general grant [noise]\nAnd Lincoln said [noise] I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like

is not a supremely shocking story on any level other than we know the name of the guy who was disappeared as opposed to presumably many other people whose names we don't know who have been disappeared second the Turkish government has a pretty strong interest in trying to humiliate the Saudis because the Turkish government\nHas basically been anti Saudi for years they're in bed with the Iranian

Hillary Clinton\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky skin absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power no no there are people who look at the incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an inch or in the power imbalance as to what an adult\nLet me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made\nSo good so good so I I Love it Trump should resign because of allegations against him but her husband should resign because of allegations against him\nAlso he didn't have used our one forty nine year old president of the United states was being serviced by twenty two year old intern in the oval office\nNone of these power anyway good to know the power imbalance is no longer a concern for feminist on ... very exciting stuff also Hillary important and said President Trump is affects us of course the reason that she knows from his infectious disease because Trump was mean to her\nIf you watched the way Trump debated me it was just interviews with sex is making fun of me for preparing well you know that's the old like oh yeah the girl in the class who's always prepared I don't need to be prepared\nThat really was how it happened in those debates\nHappened to the Trump was much of a jerk to her it's used to every other human being on the planet and it didn't play well with her because she's one of the most deeply him likeable human beings on planet earth\nJust what the Democrats have decided to full scale and break the most radical version of themselves\nYou know they say an acting that you have to get in touch with your authenticity Democrats are certainly getting in touch with their authenticity the problem is that deep down democratic leadership not particularly prominent\nBernie Sanders is is another example of this so Bernie was on Jake Tapper show on CNN and Jake Tapper asked him about the inflammatory rhetoric on the part of some folks in the Democratic party and Bernie\nFollower of who's shot up a bunch of Congress people last year came out and said that it's not that bad if people get mobbed in public places like this amazing the brain doesn't feel any necessity to say anything here about this sort of action\nYou know I listen again I don't blame Bernie Sanders for that incident last year because unless you are openly calling for violence I don't blame you for somebody going and doing violence but\nWhen Bernie Sanders refuses to condemn mouthing in public spaces you certainly is not making the country a better place\nI Am very strongly in favor of mobilizing the American people\nTo stand up and fight for economic justice and social justice and racial and environmental justice but I think we have to mobilize people I Am not a great fan of being rude or disrupting activities but this was what I Will say\nThis entire two thousand election campaign is going to come down to two words and that is voter turn up\nOkay so you're not a fan of people getting people get rid of that sort of the way that it is and voter turnout and don't want to damp and enthusiasm\nIt just shows how Democrats are willing to flirt with my politics they've been talking about for the last several months really since Maxine Waters broke out into the open with it and they're willing to do so on a on a regular basis or even willing to validate my violence on a regular basis\nOver the weekend the Washington Times report the Portland mayor Ted Wheeler came under fire over a viral video showing a heap of protestors blocking traffic and harassing drivers but he says he supports the decision by police to walk from a distance without getting involved\nBecause I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the Portland police bureau decision not to intervene the whole incident will be investigated the video was posted by journalists and you know do and it showed protesters including members of anti black lives matter walking an intersection and attempting to direct traffic while all sorts of motorcycle watch from a block away at one point\nThe activists chased down Seventy four year old ... house or after he made a right turn against their wishes pounding on his overlaps and breaking a window the car sustain downs of dollars in damage he told the Oregonian but Mr wheeler insists the motorist you feel completely safe\nComing into downtown Portland or all of this this lack of law enforcement this lack of crackdowns on antifa it leads to\nGreater heightened violence when other people who are ready for violence show up in places where antifa is now here's been my recommendation for very long time I speak and a lot of public events where protesters show up and some of those events protesters\nGet violent but I didn't know that that's happening at Cal State Los Angeles it happened at Penn State a little bit I it happen certainly at Berkeley where nine people were arrested\nMy recommendation has always been there been people who say well should I come ready for self defense I've always had his look", "year": "2018",
