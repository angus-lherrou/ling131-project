[noise]\nMichael meant that show Tuesday October second market was filling in from taxes that Haitians I'm here ah let me tell you the latest on the ... and ...\nYou've probably heard and every once in awhile there'll be a poll on your based here that indicate this is really close race or ... or quite the the bi coastal darling is getting all kinds of tons and tons of truckloads of casualties nipping at Ted Cruz's heels and there was even a poll that showed bail at one point lead\nEverybody calm down now\nHere's the deal on this race it's Ted Cruz\nAnd its Texans is ... ... dollars every time shows up on the Eleanor does something else uh outside of Texas is getting some money from inside Texas of course he is Democrats you're our ... our first success we have not had a Democrat\nElected statewide since Nineteen Ninety four\nSee why I Love living here and so I urge or a state to emulate but as soon as possible so anyway here comes ... who has a good set of campaign skills use a well spoken young man he he's not a crazy bug guide radical communist live but\nLike Phillip ... it's a\n... but he holds all the right used at the Democratic nomination in any state soft borders high taxes legal we'd skepticism about cops I just know the whole the whole thing\nAnd and it came out in the first debate he did well in the first debate he was well spoken and he was poised completed sentences in Yonkers language and but the problem was and I said this leading up to the debate\nBecause he has all these wonderful ads bay those ads are heartwarming go find them in all joined and fifty four counties here I Am an authentic breakfast and a lot because I'm not leaving anybody behind whatever but at some point he's got to start talking about what Israel the leaks are\nAnd when that happens all all all its\nTaxes and that fact catches up with him so here is a I'm a share something with you that\nAh that my friend Ted Cruz's campaign never wants me to say even our local radio much less national already he's going to win he's going to win in Bay does chances of winning vis a race are zero\n[noise] now that having been said\nIs is there a sense of urgency to this race you darn right there is because my state of Texas right here needs to deliver Ted Cruz\nThe double digit or near double digit when we need to send the Democrats are details between their legs cowed into submission so that they never try this nonsense again I don't mean running people to get Republican incumbents I mean this is\nA ring of money indoor race because if Ted Cruz only beach Beto O'Rourke by four or five points\nOr God Forbid free or something like that oh it'll be it'll be like the one in ... and I think that's a springboard debate or running for um a president twenty twenty\nSo don't don't me on this\nAnyway those are the way to prevent all of this is is protect cruise to win by at least eight nine would be good twelve would be awesome I'll take ten double digits or close to it\nA book that that is truly reflective of the taxes that I Know and the taxes that I live in and then all the demographics are changing and there's all these energetic young voters blah blah blah I Know I Know and I know Ted Cruz six years ago one by sixteen points that's not going to happen this time\nCan we can get maybe it'll be eight maybe it'll be a letter maybe it'll be seven\nBut it cannot be three four new new so the reason the cruise people don't ever want me saying this is because they need a sensitive that poll that showed ... up by one the puck champagne corks at cruise headquarters\nThey said yes this is what we need to get everybody scared or beyond belief so they'll get out and crawl on broken glass to go vote for him guess what we're going to do that anyway and you know what's\nHappening in Texas right now it's happening all over America right now\nIt's called a week long campaign commercial project groups and John Cornyn and uh

I was for intellectualism so\nThe reason I Do this is because the left is expert at using language there expert at using language to make ordinary things seem evil right so they will say something like racial profiling\nAnd using coal racial aspect racial profiling is that you know unless they mess that racial profiling police are doing it and you know there's all this trouble with the police\nBut think about this for a minute you put a cop out on the street or even more you put a TSA engine and on the line ... got Fifteen to thirty seconds to judge whether you were going to blow up a plane he's got to use every piece of information he's got one of them may be that you're carrying the grand because a lot of terrorists are bad guys there's a lot of terrorists or or Islamic\nHe's not being bigoted he's not being bigoted the problem is that the decent innocent Islamic guys being taught by the bad guy but the bad guy but that can you say you have to make his decision in a moment of racial profiling is a term it used to make that sound like it's evil\nWhen it isn't so I'm putting out the left these dictionary to translate these terms in to ordinary English things that sound like they make sense from a left but maybe don't quite make so much that's what we're hoping we're going to try and put this together as a book or in time for Christmas or you have something to give you a left wing friends\nSo that they'll hate you because there's nothing better at Christmas Time that having friends\nObsolete me theories I think for me about so here is high for interest sexuality you know let these days there\nAre I as per intersection analogy\nIntersection I Will use the memory that people can be understood intersecting social identity such as race gender class and sexual orientation it's only when you talk to all these interwoven identities is fully understood that a person knows how much he's allowed to blame this crappy like one right now\nWhen he runs crappy like one white men is called being oppressed Neal crushed gives you the right to shop stupid stuff while wearing a pink type it makes you look like a complete idiot [noise] this is a good thing because it keeps you from having to take responsibility yourself which can use up a lot of your social media San\nYou don't have enough intersecting social identities and your designated as just some ... or a white man as a white man everything's your fault and we now have to work for a living to pay taxes to support intersection so they have more free time in which the ... the crappy lives\nNow you may say well wait in America people weren't really oppressed very much and they can improve their lives by rising above the dysfunction in their communities in order to live productively\nUser call under the rules are the sexuality people using a fascist it can be shouted down [noise] sick [noise] you may say what if you shop people down here with sticks and your the fashion\nThat is called logic under the rules were just sexuality people using logical fashions it can be shouted down and ... which that\nSome people object to the underlying ideas and interest section out these people say that intersection Ali is just a way of organizing Americans into random interest groups in order to turn them against one another so that left ... power by pretending they're leaving in various forms of oppression that don't actually exist\nThese people go on to say that each person's identity ... God given now what you make of your white depends on your choices and the natural luck of the draw\nThese people are that you were lucky enough to be born in American already been given a start and have no business complaining about anything to take off your ridiculous ... stock shouting stupid things and go get a job\nWhen you get a win win faster [noise]\n\nBob Barr once\nWe get a when you [noise]\nWe can say I think\nWould\n[noise]\nOr Trump walks out in front of the press and he just he just ... silly he comes out let's just play ... ... number five\nI think the press is treated me unbelievably unfairly\nIn fact when I Won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever below do but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\nOf oh I Love it there are other brothers logo I can say that because we made the deal was not long ago [laughter] we're gonna make he's just thousands and thousands of all they want they don't want to talk about trade and the funny thing is is all about\nTrade this is one of his big big promises that he was going to rework this stuff but they don't want to talk about trade all cabinet all the time wasn't out who he is talking about this they asked him about the FBI investigations pick up a sex\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time\nJust so we all understand dishes are seven ... investigation of a man\nWho has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma for a man that she never had any\nAccusation any he's in a statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one and just last it yeah she was number one in this law school at Yale and then\nWhat he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so I I Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting [noise] I I Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nCan't read glove on in on this and it's it's interesting because you know he's not always like this we have to admit this about him he can get hot headed ... especially when he was attacked with yes just been he just looks like he has got this in his pocket and he just says you know yeah the FBI let them do what they want\nSpecially when he was attacked with yes just then he just looks like he has gotten his in his pocket and he just says you know yeah the FBI let them do what they want in there and so\nThey tried to shifted but this is the other thing they tried to shifted to drinking and that was absolutely hilarious and he then goes off on the people who are asking for these investigations us put ... number seven\nNow they talk about alcohol they talked about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at that they're bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back to high school\nAnd they're saying she drank a lot one evening in high school we you know I I tell you what I happen to know some of the United states senators one who is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive\nI've seen that person in very bad situations okay I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know\nUh I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however whatever the senators want\nIs okay with me\nAll right we'll

let's talk about the Senate drinking in the Senate I mean the stories about the drinking in the Senate or in credible\nAnd you know he's pulling the rug out from under them because in the whole thing the whole thing was not about drinking it wasn't about temperament it was about did he\nTry to raise a girl when he was Seventeen years old that was what it's about it's all ... they're just trying to move the goalposts that's what it's about and he's just calling Melanie and he just and I my my favorite remark in this whole press conference when he starts talking about\nAbout drinking and the fact that he doesn't drink and this is a ... number eleven I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't [noise]\nWhenever they're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I just you know for whatever reason [noise]\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the right to be the world's worst I'd never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWhich drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years because nobody said anything bad about him\nI'm confident that you have I mean and actually ... this is the thing Trump is talking since\nThey're talking about whether he drank in college they're talking about whether he drank in high school how about the last Twenty years oh what's his life then like I mean how confident that you have to be as president to say the fact that I don't think is my only good trait and can you imagine what a monster I Would be if you you know just how he just is feeling like he is filling issues\n... I'm Sorry but people don't notice this because a lot of people don't like Trump and they don't notice the way he changes in the way he adopts you I've always said he's a very adaptable guy he's gotten worse on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has but that\nBut that is incredible if this is like the the press is an absolute hysteria mode left\nAbsolute hysteria mode Jeff Flake it's yelled out in an elevator he collapses\nTrump is like a ... I mean I'm I'm Serious this is not normal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always been there fighting and I'm not saying that\nBut he's not always just as confident and cool about the whole thing he does not seem like he has anything at risk and when they ask them for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want they have to be I think is nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when he said it's a blessing in disguise because it's called them out that's why they have to change their tune\nBut when they ask for more time he has this great responses ...\nTell me about time Dianne Feinstein\nKnew about this too much earlier if she wanted a a really thorough investigation when all the time in the world she didn't have to wait till after the hearing was closed essentially\nShe should have said listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed\nAnd then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably did based on a very bad body language as a day but\nMore importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm including YouTube the media right I consider you are part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time for the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein brings us\nThat that is amazing it's just amazing stuff because you could see the reporters asking the question I didn't know who was was a way to a reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats she looked like she kind of when it's going to Republican struck are almost\nThe guy isn't complete control in this press conference partly I'm sure it's because of the victory NAFTA which really does ... a lot of what a lot of the attacks are really answers a lot of the attacks on him but partly it's got to be because he feels he has got this thing ... and I just this one part of why I think\nKavanaugh thing is collapsing they are not going to sell even the people on the left\nOr who are undecided\nThey're not going to sell you the yeah we said the a rape somebody as not rape but he was drinking I mean this is what they reduced and yeah but he did stand near the punch bowl he was that you know he was standing with that and he didn't get into Heathrow some ice and the guy in college", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "02"}
