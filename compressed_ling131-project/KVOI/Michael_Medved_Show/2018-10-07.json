G. E. programs have expanded\nAnd I do believe they come up with some data later on that show is that having these programs are being involved in these programs will keep you in school will prevent you from dropping out and you will continue your education and get a higher degree than other of other students\nI blame which are totally shark thank you very much\nYou're very welcome I really pay ... shake that phone call so folks have you like to enter into the conversation are likely to just give us a call here at five to zero\nSeven nine zero two zero four zero our guests today again is a Chuck Gallagher from the uh Jay Giedd organization in Tucson or as we're calling to see T. E.\nN. orders SCTV stand for or against your career and technical education grin technical education which basically what most of us are remember as a how do you take care of the things that we needed\nTo have around the house repaired and fixed and yet maybe we do not have the expertise in order to acquire that so they're teaching the young people in uh southern Arizona or throughout the state or maybe even throughout the United states depending on who has these curriculums\nAnd how to become the good plumbers good electricians along with many other organizations that do this ah this past weekend or ... you did have a program going on where there was some competition involved with a high school students is that\nCorrect yes there was Margaret rehab um what is called skills you want to say it's a student organization again that covers about Seventy different areas cosmetology um\nBut it was called skills usa it's a student organization again that covers about Seventy different areas cosmetology I'm\nA auto science fire science and construction and oversee the construction\nAnd I have I've done this for Eighteen years we had it I saw her read a high school there were a hundred and thirty four students competing and may scenario electrical plumbing solo carpentry to a person and ... and four person carpentry teams this is teaching a month\nA gang career technical education so there are a lot of events that go on and we always put this on\nThe first friday and February to start off sheet to a month it was fabulous matter of fact I Do believe that if you do go to the J Ted website you'll be able to see some photos for it and I do want a plug in for all the industry supporters for our skills usa we had about\nA probably about twenty five local industry support this contest which was pretty amazing\nAnd what was the main excitement level associated with that uh that the students really amplified while you were there\nWell one is to see their skill level\nIt is like a football game or basketball game so they are competing and they will go to the state level\nAnd if they win state they will go to nationals and national so they are competing to be the best electrician best plumber that's Mason in the country and I was blessed a few times to have state winters got to go to Kansas City it's now being held and uh uh Tennessee\nI had the twelfth vast electrician in the country\nA female which we need more\nFemales in construction and in some of the other ... she was amazing valedictorian of her class and she was the twelfth best electrician and the country and how old was she about sixteen Seventeen or Eighteen years old her senior year senior year and matter of fact ah I had her\nA Jewish at three time state champs\nAnd she went to nationals three times she slowly got better and better although the other states we have our Jay ... other states that I'll use New York they have a ... is in a lot of the tax centers across the country there are there are three hours a day\nShe was the valedictorian as I said so she couldn't take my class more than one our cars are tall and honors classes so she only had one hour training a day where these other students use competing against had three hours a day yet she went toe to toe with them and got swell place which was amazing\nThat's very respectable and so when they get involved in a trade in competition or is it trouble shooting isn't wiring or what what are the challenges presented to them just to gain if they have the knowledge to accomplish\nThe canyon there are all high school CDO up in the northwest as Josh Ron stat\nA choice of high school which is down in the southwest is a Caesar a role model then they got the team a J kid which is I guess one of the main central location which is a with a Sunnyside high school that's the sunny side high school that's Jim ... luck go\nWe have CNN a high school which is down in the southeast and read a ranch area is Michael Vick\nWe have the ... to high school which is a vicinity of ah I Nineteen down there by the local minds is Adrian morale is\nYou've got Santa Rita high school on the east side of Tucson he had Dan Walker you have San Juan when well high school where are the famous compromise um are still there but not being utilized is Gary Schmitt\nSo if you're in that area and you're listening today and you have some desire of a place in your student\nUh into one of these programs or think about these names go visit the schools and they get them set up for the participation in a level how many hours a day do the students participate in these programs if they're mainly in that high school or they have to travel to that high school\nOthers usually they're typically one hour a day and some schools are in a block schedule so they might have to now\nThe schools that you just said are not central sites for a check type programs which would be mostly in the afternoon and evening and then they're there for three hours\nSo they come in an afternoon or evening program a word or would they be going for that three hour program\nA ... there's the twenty second straight a J tap Jacob ... and then also off off Shannon there's the the hub up there which have that cosmetology fire science or police\nOr nursing so it was only certain curriculum at the centers and when you do the after hours or the ... that is correct or they're not all and uh the ... that is the ... of all the J ... okay are there the last to relate to come\nIn to uh being in the state of Arizona the the very first one was in Nineteen Ninety two and that was the east valley Institute of technology\nSo they were all by themselves and what is the ... went\nTo her more school districts form a joint technical district so it is a seat T E district and\nThose two more schools are to them or school districts to more school\nDistricts okay oh it couldn't be a to USD just two schools just tears the has eleven high school but so team at Pima Jay\nTo add a didn't\nCome around and toll it was two thousand and eight is when they were first formed and winter and Pima Jay Ted was formed it\nWasn't all the ... high schools districts excuse me all the school districts that it has now the school districts could still come in to\nA a J cat and a\nTea or see or choose me team of Jay Pratt has Thirteen school districts in it and across the state there's fourteen Jake pets so I'll give you\nA number Ninety eight thousand sixty nine students high school students are and ... to the program\nWith Anna Jake that that's pretty pretty high number is Ninety thousand and that's great but if we don't keep the funding if we don't keep the funding we're going to lose this hopefully we\nCan go into it a little later on but one of the things we lost was the freshmen funding which devastated the J tests across the state\nWe talked about earlier having these programs in middle school that's where it needs to go so you know when you have time or you're bored call your state legislator and let them know we need to get the funding back for the freshmen we actually need to put it\nIn the middle schools we need to show the students what careers or possibly out there\nWho are already get this funding back we're talking on a federal level is that correct on me now is Jay Jay ... fun and there's different funding source to Carl Perkins is federal who cannot goes to all I'm all states but a lot of states want to have more money for these as so\nWhat Arizona did is they started the J ... ah I see and that is\nThe tax payers vote on it so you can't just form a J tax without the taxpayers voting for it and they're willing to put a little bit more money and\nAnd uh the legislator controls that money and what they did is decided to balance the budget they did it on the on the backbone of\nThe freshmen taking them out and not funding them with Jay Ted funds\nWell that sounds good uh we'll come back after the break we'll talk a little bit more about the funding and how we in the southern Arizona can help our programs down here to increase the vocational I keep calling vocational ours I guess that's because of my usefulness that I have that that is that are high maturation level whenever the two that we are\nTalking about ...

I. bill from army service\nSo I was able to get an education and uh it uh it was very important it's very important to all of us I talked to a lot of kids groups uh these days and try to instill in them the importance of\nJust staying in school another week whatever it is if you get out you don't feel like you can spend four or five years in college a spin one years if you can't do that spin one semester\nBecause every day will pay off for you every day that you can get\nMore formal education you get the better you be so Ah yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much ah ah as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook a play the good role and what we're able to do\n[noise] well it's it's a it's obviously affected you in some positive way many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are on ... entrepreneurial almost from the beginning weren't you wreck\nI I've I've uh I was I didn't even know how to spell the word [laughter] much less a\nA a understand what it was but I was always fascinated about how things work out is that how does it Gabby a bank or have you get to how how does this happen um how's it going to get on his own business or whatever the business is I Would always fascinated by it always tried to\nTo watch him understand as much about it is a good and I still have that same fascination uh today is approach age of Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated about a dollar\nA how Mr del up in the market will develop it often or a a duck on a building computers and found a way to out do everybody in the world it's fascinating I still try to learn about all those like\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say here this all the time they say well you know what they did before you can't duplicate or replicate today my my opinion is you can make much bigger fortunes much faster in today's world you agree\nOr totally agree and and now there's another key element that\nThat you have such a such a premium these days are being young [noise] uh gives you an advantage not a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that ...\nAre just so positively or for all of the young people that are that are coming in and tackling the various elements of\nOf careers in one way or another\nBecause there is a premium on youth and\nAnd ah it shows so I think that I I think we're living in the very best of times uh we should understand that and we should we should say that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs created I'm of selling peanuts but I think he learned a couple of valuable lessons side of that talk about that I did\nA larger lesson minute or if you put too many peanuts in the sack when you get you get a lot of that goes with is not enough to pay for all your peanuts so what happened so what happened\nThere was a convince rather than to go by me another hundred pounds sack of peanuts and he said well you've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well but yeah I said well give me a chance of I'll make it work\nSo I Would have as many peanuts in the ... I never had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so I you know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move up through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages and I was still around today\nOf uh through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages I still remember the day\nYou know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if you like he said the first rule of private enterprise you identify in need and you know or the buyers are\nAll dismissing as the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learn I guess from that peanut business that is correct your mom's is quoted as also saying or your mother said I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made bat boy check [laughter] [laughter] you were unlike the rest of the family I take it\nWell yeah well I I was a little bit more passionate about uh about uh the things that I wanted to do and and uh uh that was so\nThat that's just been a part of all I have always been passionate about the things I Do have always enjoyed the things that I Do that that there haven't been problems and issues that come up as they always do\nBut um uh the the\nThe ... this is a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is\nThat he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today it's a gift we didn't earn it slapped we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is nobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what do we do with it\nAnd that's that's what's kind of driven my life and uh it's it's it's worked very well for me\nI guess so many people like you were saying to you know you there's a premium on youth because unfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantage is that they have now until maybe it's too late or or they wasted a lot of that but that's just typical isn't arrest\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who are who you are more concerned about the things that others and and uh they're always going to be some people it will finish your hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race of the big thing is just to get in the race it'd be a part of it\n[noise] rent you originally going to be a lawyer what happened\nWell I found out in the house is finishing my second year in law school I found out that\nThat the that profession in Nineteen fifty a really didn't pay much and the\nHours I was working two or three jobs on the campus at ours are found out that I was making more money than than starting lawyers or at that time of the old it discouraging anyone from the\nFrom the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and uh I I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRed isn't that one of the common denominator some most successful entrepreneur is what you really alluding to hear us sense of urgency to get out and earn a living to ...\nAnd and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point the patient you said you know I can calculate going forward on this track or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you go what'd you do read\nWell I got a corporate job through the University of placement service that I had about six weeks before it open form a training class open in the meantime I had a friend\nOr a in a\nCorpus Christi Texas rose my parents are living at the time that was selling e for Janine convince me to come down and and the work with them\nOr for the few weeks before I'm a corporate job opening up that I found out real early all live within two or three weeks I really enjoyed selling cars\nA so called in and checked out of um a corporate job and um but yeah we're selling cars and I like selling cars I did very well at it a within a\nThree years of able to save some money and the conventional banker that I was a was worthy of a bank loan at age twenty five I got into the used car business and then I got into\nMore ... says and then I got into the franchise business and and the automobile business has really been the basis or a lot of other things that have been apart I'm Alive\nAnd obviously you were very successful from the beginning again in your book the red zone you stated that back then the average units a month maybe sold by salesman were ten after you were in the business three weeks you set a goal and you hit thirty one car sales in the next thirty days which is pretty incredible starting out as\nCash flow is totally critical to me uh I have to create a business as to where I can I can see cash flow almost immediately and\nThe in the event that I Can't do that in a a map to get discouraged with southern pretty quickly so I'm not one to stay in keep trying to make something work this law working I get in and I think I have it planned or out I think I have the right approach to give it my best and the most of the time it works\nIf it does it well then I Move away and let somebody else tried\nInteresting we've had a number a guest on a who also attain high levels of success and number of them and said when you're going into business plan for it to take twice as long and twice as much money than you ever initially thought\nYeah I don't really plan that way up a plan that a plan that we are going to have a a almost immediately cash flow and again most of the times that make it work out you know sometimes I don't\nHave you sold any business I'm sure you have you had no sold opportunities that you don't have\nA lot of businesses that didn't work well for me at the other guy that got it may work very well absolutely I Can't say that that\nI have any amount of stature I Can't say that everything that I Do does work well it doesn't but when it does a a um usually they'll say with a very long\nWell that's pretty cool but but you sit in your own format and you're not going to deviate are that's correct\nThat's very interesting um [noise] what are there are two or three critical factors read that you look for in a deal two or three things you can always look for\nWhat forest you've got to have a product or service that you
