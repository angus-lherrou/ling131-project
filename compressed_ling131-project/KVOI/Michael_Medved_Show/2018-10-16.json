were wearing this is the day after Trump's inauguration and remember Madonna said she had been thinking about blowing up the White House and and people were okay it's almost two years later and here we are\nAnd so what is supposed to be accomplished with all this rage\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThe Internet is filled with photos of powerful women looking angry\nThis is a from that book are good and mad\nWhen may see those images mouths open unrestrained mid yell spittle lacked the very act of making a loud noise a sign of their ugly ugly and unnatural personalities and think twice well you would hope so\nBut there are a lot of images like that and then also a lot of desires to try to honor past acts of anger\nOr yesterday was the fiftieth anniversary of a truly historic an epic day and the history of American culture\nI it uh involved well actually it wasn't yesterday it was um longer goes in that uh but it was September of Nineteen sixty\nEight they uh they had a\nPublic what was called a bra burning though they didn't actually burned browse the actually threw them away to protest the Miss America pageant\nOr we will get to that why is this a heroic thing and the important thing\nToday by the way I'm pretty sure is the anniversary of a um another fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and two athletes or John Carlos and Tommie Smith\nWho won a gold medal and a bronze medal and I stood there on the stage and they held up their gloves hands and a black power salute and basically it changed their lives\nDid

Bill Clinton uh it was interesting when you play those excerpts to hear someone who people making a point that there was a power imbalance between him and Monica Lewinsky\nInvalidated the relationship or made it a can rape or assault or what have you and\nI was just like to point out that one of the most well known facts of male female sexual dynamics is that women tend to be attracted to a powerful men [noise] uh and not so much the other direction by the way men don't necessarily\nKnow aren't necessarily tracked into our for women so if you want to invalidate that you know those kinds of relationships there could be\nEven angrier more frustrated women and the one who wrote the book you mentioned\nWhat is it I think the problem in in\nThe abuse of power the abuse of power was not only in terms of pursuing their relationship which has certainly Monica Lewinsky was very enthusiastic about there's no question about it\nBut uh was in concealing their relationship and a and hitting back at a great number of people and by the way using federal resources it's it's so astonishing\nThat right now people on the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with\nPresident Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as unbearable\nOn the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with\nPresident Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as embarrassing and tawdry as it may be involved the time before President Trump was in the White House long before\nAnd uh does that mean that it's utterly irrelevant no I mean there there are ongoing legal action some of which by the way has been dismissed that that Stormy Daniels defamation suit has been dismissed\nShe can't sue President Trump for

two points I Want to make is one is a Christian and there's always angry\nAnd Sally response he gives an angry response to something and then the only way to respond is with that same kind of anger it makes sense right that way you communicate the second point\nI Want to make is that um\nThey're still doing Miss America because in ... me too they got rid of the swimsuit competition I think that that changed this year and of course it had the lowest ratings would ever did I um I I'm not a tremendous fan of Mr America but for goodness sake ... is the basis for rage\nReally will speak about

[noise]\nAnd on the Michael Mann that show I I wanted to say or something actually more than some they want to say a couple of things about something's happened that's been in international news but it's happened right here where I live and work\nAnd it's a had a big uh emotional impact on me and I think on a lot of people who pay attention to the larger world you've probably heard that the co founder of Microsoft Paul Allen\nThe lesser known cofounder of Microsoft he started that company together with his high school buddy Bill Gates\nPaul Allen died\nYesterday and I found out about it I was shocked he was only sixty five and yes that counts as only this year\nHe he died at sixty five of non Hodgkin's lymphoma he'd just announced two weeks ago that he had a recurrence of lymphoma he's been battling cancer for a long time\nHe was initially diagnosed in Nineteen eighty three which was why he left Microsoft initially he beat the cancer\nThen it it came back in various forms as sometimes it does and I I never met Paul Allen a he lives in\nArea he has had a long time commitment to it but I thought there were a couple of things that were highly relevant or people who were men bring him for all of his charitable endeavor as it is in ...\nAnd for all of his charitable endeavor as it is and Suzie Adams and is on the ships of sports teams he was the owner of the uh world champion Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks\nHe saved the Seahawks franchise for Seattle there was a plan to move the hawks down to Los Angeles by the previous owner\nAnd a Allen stepped in he's also the owner of the Portland TrailBlazers he uh actually always like basketball more than football apparently but he came to be\nAlmost a model owner for the Seahawks the the one point that I Would make about him as there is a general resentment of rich people of billionaires Paul Allen was reputed to be worth about twenty billion dollars that's let's be clear twenty thousand million dollars\nAnd if you think about that that's just an almost unimaginable amount of money he has given at least two billion dollars to charities since his\nInitial a cancer diagnosis and the charities have been so wide ranging and for the most part so noble apology Allen philanthropies\nHas been emphasizing the environment including preserving or some some wilderness areas and and global health and helping with diseases like Ebola\nBut he's also had more local\nFocus and and this is one thing that I wanted to to speak about particular it's very unusual for somebody to basically grow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he's had just an enormous impact on the city almost all of it very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle comments\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAnd a a bunch of warehouses in a very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union and uh and then that would have\nBeen surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned down and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings and that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then is developing this big museum with a controversial building by Frank Gehry some people hate the architecture's others love it\nHe um owns the Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks\nHe developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence he also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying

Hampshire was very very close last time\nHillary Clinton very narrowly won the state and uh they brought Alec Baldwin and to speak and\nWhy did they bring Alec Baldwin in well I guess they were looking for someone who could\nAddress the issue of overthrowing the government in a balanced and reasonable way here is what the Alec Baldwin not impersonating Donald Trump this time and just say at the uh democratic dinner in New Hampshire\nWe implement change in America is through elections were changed governments here at home in an orderly and formal way in orally ephemeral way\nAn awful way we need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [noise]\n\nThere was a small country people currently in power to hell bent on continuing in malicious immigration policy that as a country up for charges of human rights violations by the global community\nThis country as looted money from the federal treasury deposited directly into the bank accounts of their most ardent political supporters so that they and several generations of their descendants will have the resources to maintain the GOP and political power for as long as\n... doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory\nWell it is now there's a history on this dinner this was originally called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as it used to be told on the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party\nProblem with those two guys they were both slave owners and big time slave owners hundreds of flights so they changed the last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had no abuse of power he was urine says the driven snow\nBut do you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrate and we will get to that um so what did he change it to\nMe what democratic reach our Lyndon Johnson they they have Lyndon Johnson on tape using the N. word\nA bronco Obama is still a little bit too recent and especially if you call the rock Obama Day and you don't have a bomb on their side lighting that he didn't come see you know what they did it the Eleanor Roosevelt there\nI'm Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was very bright lady um she was a I can you imagine because you can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do the Jefferson Jackson\nThe Eleanor Roosevelt day dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um

was going to come back and bite back\nAgainst Democrats maybe not in San Francisco and maybe not in Boston\nBut yes in western Pennsylvania and most of the state except for filling a and this is the

claiming that she's a member of the Cherokee Nation or whether it is the president of the United states addressing a former lover as horse age\nWe're living in a weird world we begin with the president of the United states who decided that he doesn't like Stormy Daniels anymore so\nHere's what happened there they want to its own again you'll have filed against the president of the United states is always a frivolous stupid lawsuit anybody with a law degree knew this and there was a suit in which she sued him for defamation after he tweeted that she was engaged in a ... job\nAnd she he tweeted us get years later about a non existent in a total ... job playing the fake news media purple when she claimed that she was stopped by a guy who was in my truck and she sued him for the nation\nAnd that's not a ... she's a public figure defamation is knowing and knowingly and maliciously attacking someone false information at knowing and militias in the standard for public figures it wasn't knowing it wasn't it was just basically free speech and him giving an opinion\nBut she sued him for ... and then it was thrown out the case was thrown out\nAnd here's what the judge wrote the court agrees with Mr Trump's argument because between watching constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics in public discourse in the United states the first amendment protects this type of rhetorical state and not only that the judge ruled that Stormy Daniels now had to take from legal fees out\nSo the president to the United states had a had a response on Twitter remember this is in office wants to occupy by\nAbraham Lincoln George Washington Ronald Reagan here's the president of the United states especial statement on his Twitter account quote\nHad really judge throws that's me Danielle is that the insurance company and edited the nicotine great now I can go after or space and her third written I integrate that taxes should confirm that she signed there's nothing about me\nA total time well\nThat's one way to step on the news cycle so we could have done an entire week of Elizabeth Warren now we will do an entire week of the president of the United states calling a woman he once had sex with ...\nYeah so that's the thing now a couple of different things to note here first of all if you had to sum up this entire this entire new cycle in one mean it'd be President Trump at the Lone Ranger silver\nWould be more space Stormy Daniels and ... would be Elizabeth Warren so\nOur our artistic geniuses in the back of my cooking up that one right now by with that said um is it good that the president of the United states called any woman horse they no probably not a good thing is it\nSmart and he calls a woman he once had sex with horse race well it does calling to judge it does call into question his judgment regarding women kind of a weird thing to do like you have sex with a woman you're not married to and then you color or say they won't rip on her or rip on your taste because it's kind of weird\nGoing to be a love for us as he does\nOkay so President Trump he he's eager to go after Elizabeth lord\nAgain I still think we need the image of him with a publishers clearinghouse ice check handing it to to to Elizabeth Warren in order to basically have that image linked with Elizabeth Warren forever unfortunately it seems like he's level and he's less interested in whether Elizabeth Warren has a relationship with John Doe and more interested in whether it's Stormy Daniels is in fact silver\nAs other away as we continue to earn the bench Shapiro\nShow why in the world that Elizabeth Warren actually pushing you Native American ancestry why did she thinks this was a good idea all she had to do is say I listen to my relatives and turns

set\nWith all of us that the economy continues to do while this was such a good news cycle it really was it was such a good news cycle the economy was doing great\nThen then new job numbers are just terrific\nNot only that we have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\n... if you if you just look at the numbers we're collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rate economy has been going great guns under President Trump got to the deficit and a second which is not quite as good but\nIt's a very good news cycle for President Trump in the last three weeks you got a Supreme Court justice and watch less killed themselves over Capitol you got all those with Lauren and one of the great ... political wonders in my lifetime releasing report saying she was Native American when she is less she's west Indian than actual people from India\nLike actual people from India have more Native American blood that Elizabeth Warren does\nAn amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people horse day this is the only line of attack that Democrats have is just attacks on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up Nancy Pelosi was looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the shouting at the reading the President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to the murder of Dr ... shah get elected ... an American residents who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also than a Muslim Brotherhood\nShe says the reason Trump hasn't been ... because maybe he's being paid off by the shouting\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia I think that was I always wondered why he went there is the first country to visit to the United states of course as president of the United states oh the other presidents back to Ronald Reagan went to\nTo um Canada which one to Mexico to Chevy Bush to enter the fear was that many friends and allies who could have gone to see it was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of financial transaction involved there whether for his businesses or what ever\nGood luck with his line of attack it it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats and the only way that they're going to be able to win elections has by simply throwing out on verified and on verifiable information like that but it shows how desperate they are which is why again an forced errors are the biggest problem for the ... the ministry and they've always been\nThe biggest problem for the front diminished ration here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever shut the first one\nReally because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever and if you if you watch\nTennis player ... very often you'll see that that sometimes the best strategy is just get the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody is going to smack the ball into the net\nAnd then he went basically ... there's\nA great wind which which comedian is endings Mitch Hedberg is that ... that the name of the comedian um and so he has a line he says no matter how good the problem I have a tendency to no matter how could I get I'm never better than the wall\nWell that's that's essentially what's happening in American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you win that's all if you are the person who just sits there and let the other side banging his head against you you win\nIf you're the person who commits on force errors you lose the Democrats have been committing an forced air after an forced air here\nAnd that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but and again I guess we're going to have an entire news cycle now about ... doesn't hurt Trump in any serious way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again it reminds them how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for
