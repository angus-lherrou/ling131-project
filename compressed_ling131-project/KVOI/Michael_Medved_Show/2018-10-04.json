have been taken into custody by police\nAre just now and they've been taken into custody on Capitol Hill after descending on the heart Senate office building to protest the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh\nWho is President Trump's a Supreme Court nominee loud chance could be heard throughout the Senate building\nHo ... got to go hey hey oh that's\nWhat they're chanting allow chance could be heard throughout the Senate building which is structured so the hallways and each floor open up and look out onto the first floor where a dozens of protesters they say were staged\nUm look uh\n... what is it that they want a we had a caller earlier on the show who made the case that ah look\nPeople feel cheated by the entire electoral system because in two thousand Al Gore got more votes than George W. Bush he didn't get a majority but he got more popular votes than George W. Bush he lost the election\nAnd uh then last time in November of two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton three million more votes than Donald Trump she didn't get a majority and yet she lost the election how did that happen while it happened largely because the third and fourth parties but leave that aside\nA President Trump won the election you won the electoral college President Bush won the election won the electoral college so if our caller is right and these protesters are really protesting the system by which we elect presidents the only way to change that as a constitutional amendment\nAnd it won't do you know why\nBecause under our constitution in order to change the constitution you need three quarters of the state legislatures to go along with the change\nAnd there are more than Thirteen states and that's all it would take that are small enough that they would lose a lot of cloud just the electoral college went away I mean right now New Hampshire is a very important state New Hampshire has only four electoral votes\nBut those four electoral votes in close elections really count people go to New Hampshire not just because the New Hampshire primary states like Wisconsin Wisconsin is ten electoral votes\nAnd people go to Wisconsin and part of the genius of the federal system is meaning it is I mean that you need to win not a majority\nOf the wrong popular vote but a majority of the various states which have their independent existence\nAnd look that design now those states are are weighted not one vote per each state but they are awaited according to population\nAnd so it's worked out for two hundred and forty years\nThe the idea that that is what this protest is really about what the protest really is about is just his Dario on the left about losing some of the dictatorial power that had been assumed by activists on the Supreme Court\nLet's go to your calls and to Tammy in Marietta, Georgia you're on the ... that show it's disagreement day\nHigh I ever how are you I'm well\nHey man a disagreement that disagreement if I'm the kind of several weeks ago\nBut my thing that is why it's so passionate about this man is almost like it here nephew and you just so angry that people don't believe hammer that it's possible that he violated this lady and he very possible that he could have done is not\nJust for lying about it but it's nothing it confine\nIt's almost like it or break your heart you just so angry that people are angry about it I don't understand why this particular man I mean Daniel Schorr even overturn roe anyway but you sure that have gone to abolish devoting right 'cause that's that's what people\nAre passionate about and all that long serving is\nOkay let me I Will I Will answer that in a moment but I Want to let you finish you had another disagreement and I will answer your question very directly coming right out but go ahead what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThis agreement a few weeks ago you were talking about [noise] uh I I think I don't know what it was a young black man said he felt unsafe and I'm a white neighborhood and I just make you mad they couldn't make that statement but and you try to convince you stay true and I'm sure\nAnd you try to convince you stay true it's true but you don't know how this young men feel and white neighborhood made me feel unsafe every white neighborhood is not say\nThat's absolutely true you're right I Am but what he was saying is that he feels unsafe in any white neighborhood not just that he feels unsafe and specific white neighborhood which can be crime written the point that I was making was that\nYou know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth or in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming\nEvidence at all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is she really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him but I Do know people have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm al ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with a a judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on auto early unsupported unprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and\nAnd uh and violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is not a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly denied a vet I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up\nBut why not express compassion for somebody in that situation appreciate your calling your challenge um

connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcome the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before

him Theodore Roosevelt and uh not Teddy Roosevelt as he's often no\nWell that's because President Roosevelt always lose the the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called TD and he didn't like it and he never liked being called teddy and he once declared anyone who calls me and he doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well there's also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name\nThere are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and there are other

alcohol abuse or did you ah ever see judge Kavanaugh showing the signs of any kind of alcoholic impairment\n[noise] Michael I absolutely not a hundred or a hundred percent a hundred percent not you know there\nSome accusations that had been made that you know I understand how some of his critics might say well ... will never ... you know they think they'll never ... I Believe I Know the truth but they think about you\nBut these accusations about things that he's done and how what about you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school college that he was wild and crazy um if this was an open secret and all his friends all of its queens is the time what is known about a and instead it's quite the opposite\nLet's queens is the time would have known about\nA and instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best dozens scores of people high school and college over and over again say\nHe was he he was he was not while he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students are and and the description of him that in painted by a few uh you know outliers a roommate who you know hasn't you know ... they had a falling out or something or if it's just not sure\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps a a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats\nAnd I'm One of the snake as as a professor of law now and somebody who was very well schools and constitutional law whether you think that a Senator Graham suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment here he is principal grant\n[noise]\nUp as a bottom say why don't we don't want to say\nOkay what he says why don't we don't come in water and see if he floats a good old medieval trial by ordeal what do you think\nOf straight out of my python and the holy grail a and a\nYou know I Do I I I think that this process has been really unfair to to judge Kavanaugh and also the doctor I think that they have both been used\nBy Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes or their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face of Dr Ford their ... their their strategy all along has been to do whatever they have to do by any means necessary away for the sake\nOf delay and I think that strategy has been transparent it goes back to you know how some years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents was enough or whether it needed to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way\nThat explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received it was only leaked to the press against her will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament\nFor them to talk about credibility\nUm [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility jak Kavanaugh's way\nWhat if you were speaking to judge Kavanaugh I I Do believe you will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who knows it could be fifty to a but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\n[noise] to rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be present shirts and after two I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of technical legal mind for twelve years on the DC circuit when he was indicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times\nAnd we also saw in the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench spring caught hopefully he will be\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be it'll be the same kind of judge she'd been for the past twelve years so I'm I'm looking for that I share your cautious optimism I understand uh you know it it it\n... the process is so farcical at times that it leads to sell it lends itself to jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that the people have been hurt by Kavanaugh's been hurt his family doctor for they've received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we fix it ... and that's the last question that will have time for Justin Walker professor of law how do we fix the process\nOf making [laughter] um you know I I'm just do what we for worker or as we were talking earlier with the Harvard but\nYou have the gal degree and I'm going

lot of breaking Newsday surrounding Brett Kavanaugh we begin today with the news that Mitch McConnell is filing cloture\nMeaning that we're not going to allow the Democrats to filibuster the cabinet nominee and that means that by Saturday the full Senate will be voting on Brett Kavanaugh there was Mitch McConnell yesterday announcing that he was going to file cloture on the floor of the Senate\nThere'll be plenty of time for members review and be briefed on the supplemental material before fraud cloture vote so I'm going cloture on drugs ... this evening so that process can move forward ... earlier\nAnd the process should move forward the process should move forward because guess what shocker it turns out\nBut nothing has been found and we've been doing this for another week another week thanks to Senator Jeff flake and the idea the FBI investigation was going to call everyone you're clearly that's happened clearly Democrats are now very satisfied with how this is going everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI folks I don't know what\nIt really feels like a full investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied about all this take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI inquiry and she saw that basically said nothing you mentioned you know what I feel like it's been settled I guess now really consider Brett Kavanaugh's nomination or\nAlternatively she did what everyone knew what she would do and she said oh no investigation is a bunch of ... and it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats can't vote for Kavanaugh on that basis or is Dianne Feinstein really has just been\nI mean there's no other word for it in terms of the process that using gauge than than evil I mean it really has been an evil process in which she's in gauge getting an allegation on July thirtieth holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMay be releasing it anonymously in order to spur the full release of the story and then grilling Brett Kavanaugh unsupported gang rape\nAnd all of its been gross but Here's Senator Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being rose by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and because it's incomplete therefore that's really why would you vote on Kavanaugh\nBut what I can say is that the most notable part of this report is what she's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview Brett Kavanaugh we have seen even more pressure forged witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interviews\nOkay so I Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she made it so she says what's most important is all the people you have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence was not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for and any of Christine Blasey Ford allegations\nNo corroborating evidence none the GOP Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley said there is no hint of misconduct and confidential report on Kavanaugh sexual misconduct claims he says there's nothing in it and we didn't already know\nSusan Collins and Lisa Murkowski at least using Palin's from from Maine just adjusting to the FBI process has made her feel a little more quiet about this whole thing maybe that's what Jeff Flake was going for is do the best possible spin on it\nBeing a victim of bowling does not mean that I think that anyone who was a bully in high school also rape checks\nBut that's the implication from New York and you wonder why the right is reacting with outrage to all of this that's why the writers racking carriage coming up Dr Christine\nBlasey Ford's attorneys respond to the FBI investigation suffice it to say they are unhappy but the reason they are happy as White House lane why that reason is just does it end will

[laughter]\n\n\nWelcome back Dr Christine Blasey Ford Brett Kavanaugh's accuser endless possibilities or she is now coming out in the FBI investigation was surprise surprise incomplete her attorneys who are democratic ... ... they send out a statement it said quote an FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview with Dr Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses\nCorroborating testimony cannot be called an investigation where profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice you met him coming forward was directing the FBI investigation will not interested in seeking the truth if you think what she testified under oath at like there was no reason for the I've got to talk to her again if she ... she committed perjury\nThere's no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second\nThey talk to all of the witnesses\nThey gave sworn statements and those witnesses did not back her story\nWhen they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses Robert because that's money there are no witnesses to corroborate her testimony there's talk of one on the left that women would never falsified would never metro member would never lie about allegations of right now I have\nTremendous sympathy for people who are alleged sexual assault\nI Do I mean when when she first came out I said this is a credible account and and I I Want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on that there's no corroborating evidence for coming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh dancing on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows 'cause there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWith that said one of the things that's been put out there by by poked on the left is that there's no incentive for women in high profile cases come forward\nI have two or three Anita Hill any to health care all on the left or the last twenty five years HBO made it both series about her and if you think there is no incentive for women's ... born in shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful mean here was time magazine cover this week or the time magazine cover this week is up Christine Blasey Ford swearing with her eyes closed and her entire fate is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who had not benefited at all from the publicity\nI Would say that Christine Blasey Ford is one of most worship stickers on the left today so that's not an implication that she's lying but isn't jumping the incentives are stacked in one direction is just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nIt is true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but you also had an interest to get the women don't have an interest in coming forward and high profile cases because all they're going to get the downside is just it's not accurate cut not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she was why\nWe ought to be honest about what the incentive structures here are incentive structures are in place for allegations you sometimes you may if they weren't and he wouldn't have high profile cases when women come forward and say something and it turns out that their vetting are making things up\nSo that is that is a point number one point number two there are a bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claimed to have nothing to do a cabin on and this is supposed to be ... be great\nTo bunker up cameras there was a piece in USA Today that woman was promoting on Twitter and what she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate is the reason that he shouldn't be on or to remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court was that he was conservative\nThan the reason that you shouldn't be on the court is because he allegedly committed sexual assault than when there was no corroborating evidence you shouldn't sit on the court because he was part of an angry this woman in USA Today says I remember my angry father and that's why Brett Kavanaugh options on the court\nWhat in the world that have to do with anything\nThat's like anything I was used in high school by bowling Brett Kavanaugh's bully in high school I mean the right to check and therefore I posted nomination if a bad thing happened to you in your life thanks to a person who is not a person we are talking about that doesn't mean that the person that issue actually committed a crime against a person who is not you\nIt's well General Electric I have a relative was murdered that means that send you a committed murder\nOf another person there is no logic to that whatsoever first of all then you'll get away with it she's very clever dastardly in fact in her cleverness\nBut it's a nonsense of water and that's an argument that's been repeated which believe all women because something happened to me\nIt is important to note that all his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by a bunch of Democrats and then they were digging through his yearbooks for every claim that has been made about his wife had been that supposedly he downplayed his drinking or lives about his high school yearbook\nOr live out of high school you know I'm not going to defend line I'm not going to pretend that Brett Kavanaugh wide about things I think that makes them squeaky clean\nLet's go through a list of the supposed ally that rights have not all this from Boeing ... going going as if our website and\nSo this means they're going to get about as comprehensive of you well it's actually from media matters which is comprehensive news you can come up with of Brett Kavanaugh's lives so what are we supposed ally have enough that he did not travel in the same social circles as four but he did\nAnd then they said well he traveled in the same social circles well what's the evidence that some of the people she says we're at a party with her Ron his calendar\nThat's not the same social circles that six degrees of Kevin Bacon and that is what that's that's like saying that you know I travelled same social circle of send you an Airforce and his friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all\nAlso they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi by suggesting he did not drink on weekdays that's not true he said he rarely drink on weekdays and his own calendar and in fact you refer openly and his testimony to counter that on this day I probably drink at all I Know I probably drink to test out on my calendar\nHave enough that he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad and law school there but he was the lead if he had ... and ...\nAnd it's really not all I can see in many his grandfather went to Yale in Nineteen oh wait\nNot here law school in jail and so that's that's not that's not actually I think what else did he lie supposedly he lied about blacking out from drinking but he didn't live out that there's no evidence that he actually did blackouts from breaking\nNow the Democrats kept using blackout from Britain because what they're ... they're attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford interest in remember the incident that's what they are attempting to hit you say but there's no actual evidence of that\nSo there is no why they're either now what you could say that he was playing his his drinking in the most favorable possible like I think that's fair but that's not the same thing as as perjuring yourself as lying openly\nWill go through a couple of more of these proposed lots of red cab not called virtual our heads of the rebels the silver political as well\nBut first

ally the Brett Kavanaugh told so this is their final ditch attempts they said we\nCan't nominated me his sexual assault ... and then they said we can't nominated because other women had been raped by other people who are not a cabinet ... and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with well he committed perjury committed perjury as well one problem\nNo evidence he commit perjury help somebody other accusations they say that have not fight in Maryland and drinking age and explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing is that he said in his testimony he was to be able to legally drink they said the drinking age Maryland was Eighteen he said that in his testimony\nAnd then they get to the booth thing right so they suggest that they lie committed perjury when the charged with perjury for saying that in his year book when he was Seventeen he used the word booth means parts and what it actually means is anal sex I'm not kidding this is what they actually are saying\nThat what everyone knows that moving as anal sex and I didn't know the moving was was that that we're also it turns out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word but also something I didn't know but there's been substantial research on the ... thing\nAnd it turns out that there is no way to substantiate that is a lot also the term devil's triangle so there is ingestion\nIs the right to have not using a pornographic reference about two Jews and one girl and a three some again he says that that was a drinking and it seems a pretty weird way towards your your past and drunkenness to term devil's triangle or drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who have said that they have heard of that as well\nAnd so they they're it's a bunch of people who said no he actually meant that now let's let's remember\nWhy is any of this material it's only material because the suggestion by Democrats is that he put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means you sexually assaulted a girl when he was Seventeen that in itself is an insane line of inquiry it's an insane like have you ever read a Facebook page\nI mean people have been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school in my yearbook page was clean I Can't say the same for all my friends are there are references that people didn't necessarily understand and the ... pages and an orthodox Jewish day school and I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such references\nJets insomnia you guys went to high school were there any obscure we're sexual references in your your book by dude\nYeah that's right too many to count is precisely the right answer because\nOf course have you ever met a teenage boy I Love all the senators were drunk in Laos going really well when you were Seventeen you wrote in your your book about drinking and making sexual references\nLike okay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever met a Seventeen year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero zip jumped but if Brett Kavanaugh downplayed that in his testimony doesn't mean she was perjure cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's six years old\nAnd ... they do here is that by some finally they narrow it down finally they narrow it down so what does this they also suggest that he lied when he says that he had a weak stomach so he used to throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol and or spicy food\nAnd I also have a weak stomach I throw up a lot to that could happen from breaking I've never thrown up because of breaking actually because I don't actually threaten 'em but [laughter] but they managed have it's like you know I Know now I'm I'm not I'm not desperate enough to bring that a shot at such as that that that'd be just terrible but\nIt's it's so finally they come down to one they've narrowed and on one thing one thing that the ... thing and that was Frank all the stuff\nBut it's just a bunch of nonsense and they narrowed down to one thing and one thing only there is there only a credible claim in my opinion there only a credible claim that Brett Kavanaugh lied in his testimony their own a credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of the boys your book pages about a woman named ... dolphin who's an attendee of local all girls high school\nNow a few things you might need to know that we're in a dolphin before we actually get to the supposed ally right dolphin was good enough friends with Brett Kavanaugh that originally she signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good to girls when he was in high school\nShe was on that letter and she was friends with him for many many years\nAnd she signed that letter there is no accusation that she had sex with him in high school there's an occupation that he sexually assaulted her high school is not he's Asian that he touched her in high school not\nSo what exactly is the claim acquainted on fourteen boy your book pages\nWas a reference to Renee alumnus referring to her\nAnd other references suggests that ... that she was that this was a joke about a bunch of ... among a bunch of guys ingesting that they were alumni of her genitals essentially the day that there's a bunch of guys had had sex with her and when Kavanaugh was asked about this he said that this was an attempt a clumsy attempted affection among his friends\nRight that's that's what he said in his in his actual testimony and I want to see if I can grab the actual text of testimony that I can find exactly what it is that that he was that he was claiming but the the basic suggestion of of Brett Kavanaugh is that this was not in fact\nA a reference to sex with Renee alumnus the raid on this was not a reference to sex with Renee\nDolphin New York times had a piece where they said that it was horrible and hurtful\nAnd here's what the New York times that they send it to a judge Kavanaugh's classmate dimensions Renee we're part of the football players unsubstantiated boasting about their conquest and having not suggested that it was a clumsy attempt right that it was it was a clumsy attempt at affection\nNow maybe that's true and maybe that's not\nBut there is no way to substantiate perjury first of all it's not material I writing materiality provision in the FBI and the the OJ manual and second of all\nIt is fair to say that a clumsy or a close ally ... here's how he plays it quote one thing in particular we were at about one of our good one of our good female friends we would admire and went to dances with had her name used on our page with the term alumnus it's harmless ... used to show affection\nShow she was one of us there was no way to substantiate anything differently except theoretically they could have gone and asked one of the other Thirteen guys and use your name on the pages if that's what that meant they didn't because you know what they couldn't find anyone to testify what it meant as we all had sex with Renee Renee dolphin ... based on him\nBeing made about your book phrase towards along when he was Seventeen that means he can't sit on the Supreme Court", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael
