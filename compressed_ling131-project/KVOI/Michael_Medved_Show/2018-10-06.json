week of um his training is actually meet doing that deliveries along with him and showing him the process and um\nMain things that I actually try\nAnd ... and then grain in his head is speed at the deliveries is not the important part important part is that when you walk in you walk in with a smile and you\nJust have a good sign up that you and you do that deliver the right way not just any way putting it where they want it making sure they're happy and then going you're merry way to the next delivery and I'm\nJust\nBasically that I'm One of my important tenet to or it might drivers and do any of my employees\nYeah I think and you know it's a funny thing\nBecause you get if you're if you're delivery type person right you you you've probably got more stops to making a date and maybe you want to make and so you get in a hurry you get your in your vehicle your driving you know you're trying to to be efficient and get a get it done but then when you show up at a customer location you kinda gotta change modes\nAnd all of a sudden it becomes not about you but about that customer\n... exactly\nYeah exactly and you know what driving around town with the bearer in the in a van that's

almost make an event out of it there at the office so that's an option for you had a chance to talk with Jerry about something called\nConscious capitalism\nWhich is a an international group founded by John Mackey the founder of whole foods market John founded that company back in Nineteen eighty he and his hippy girlfriend he was a hippie to makes no bones about it socially progressive opened up there in Austin or a a\nStore a a an organic you know precursor that was called safer way\nAnd he got involved in the Austin co-op community lots of a food co-op going on around there all of them of course turn a socialist leanings and John being an idealist really thought that this was going to work out great\nAnd then but he became disillusioned because they couldn't make any money they did a lot of bickering between each other and instead of really focusing on how\nTo deliver great products to their customers they they've targeted or other less socially conscious members of the business community and spend all their energy going after them after a couple of years the ... the producer a Tom here as wanting to know\nFor safer way had something to do is safe way it's hard to get anything passed come by and I think he's probably right\nSafer way anyway they did this for a couple of years got disillusioned with it but they had a lot of believers in what you know what they're trying to do and so they got some investors and they opened the first whole foods market there in Austin in Nineteen eighty\nAnd within a couple of years that had become mentally popular they were doing a ton of business that community love them the concept was starting to be a starting to get some notoriety beyond just to Austin in Texas\nAnd then in Nineteen I Believe was Nineteen eighty three Austin went through the worst flooding in its history\nAnd a ruined that whole foods market it flooded the market destroyed all of their product destroyed all of their merchandising and much of their building they didn't have insurance to cover this they lost everything in that flood\nAnd what happened they were I mean there was bankrupt as you can get and what happened was\nTheir customers showed up as soon as the wander reach seeded with mumps and buckets their bankers showed up with the same thing and their suppliers did the same thing they got the place cleaned up got to put back together the bankers extended them a line of credit and put them back in business\nAnd that was what John Mackey calls his first\nAwakening in business and understanding the importance of\nA stakeholder community and that's when he ... the first time he realized\nThat stakeholders include many more people other than just stock holders their stockholders are certainly important\nAnd he was the stock holder and and as a business partner you have at the time they were stockholders but there were many others who were stakeholders and without those stakeholders without the buy in from those stakeholders\nWhole foods market or as we know it would never come into existence ... would not have been bought out by Amazon if that hadn't happened\nBut uh so anyway I thought that was an amazing story and really demonstrated the importance the significance of a long term perspective on your business and one of the big big problems in corporate America the day especially publicly traded corporate America is that CEOs\nAnd board board members are under so much pressure to deliver\nFinancial report as financial results stellar financial report results in the next quarter\nRather than thinking about the implications and the impact of what we're doing today a year from now five years from now ten years from now the way we think about things in our own lives I'm a corporate America does not is not usually able to do that\nYou know the blood is oxygen aided nutrient rich flushing toxins and the brain cells\nAll this awesome name black where to go which is where you're paying\nOkay so you know go in this thing and it's so cold the blood rushes to your core 'cause it's kind of trying to save your life then all these nutrients go with it in and all this activity is

therapy\nI'm Talking about the inflammation a little bit I Know a lot of people have inflammation and you know in a lot of different ways\nYeah myself I'm myself I'm also a lot of inflammation so um

your body temperature drops in all of a sudden everything kinda all the energy use redirected the core of your body kind of in survival mode um that your metabolism is also elevated at that point to

that in in what period of time\nUm I Would say and about three months\nThree months now and you haven't been hit the gym two times a day he just didn't do\nMy injuries are so bad that I I I I'm In

hear people talk about the amazing results that they get from it you almost feel like this is too good to be true but then when you dig into it and you and you find out how many people are saying things like that and how credible\nThose people are and we certainly uh you know athletes\nDon't they don't want to suffer after a game by exposing your body to a hundred and eighty three below zero

which is the first of these three parts and you talk about ... work and how you got into Tucson and and what he's going to cover in the morning session\nA lot it's a\nIt's a pleasure Jay and I have known each other for about Twenty years uh I had a start up company in the late nineties would venture capital backs up in fiber optics from Jay was a pretty much in the world expert in the fiber optic market at the time uh he's got a got an MBA\nA big market at the time uh he's got a a is you've got an MBA for more than a real is all a sharp business mind and\nWhen we started to uh look to market our products we brought in as a consultant or we got to know each other very well there's lots of customers are put together business plans and uh and\nUh we uh kept in touch over the years uh and he wound up working in the or self driving car market with a company called ... light waves which is in New Jersey\nAnd because it's optics is a common theme here so they work on fiber optics a self driving cars actually use a technology called lidar which was initially developed for aircraft\nAnd some self driving cars use radar but quite a few of them now use wide or which is a light based a technology for determining how far away something is and how fast moving\nAnd I'm Jay was a fortunate enough to um uh with his management team at a prison lately have cell that a company to forge a than using permanently ways uh you know it's all\n... states kind of have some free time as he did very well at that and we were talking and I said hey it'd\nBe a great uh it'd be a great speaker here
