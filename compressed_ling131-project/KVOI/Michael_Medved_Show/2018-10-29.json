the events in Pittsburgh on Saturday\nA one person who had a very direct connection to those events in a person his daughter\nAnd a was Paul ... who is a good friend who's been on the show many times before he is a professor of history and to the growth City College where I'm privileged to participate every year and they're wonderful vision and values\nA conference and poll is the author of many many books he's the author of a great new book that I could recommend more strongly called the pope and a president about the amazing friendship between Ronald Reagan and John Paul the second\nAnd a whole writes in that book from the perspective his perspective as a devout Catholic and a very active lake Catholic so how is it that a Catholic Boy like you get simply hated in this terrible shooting at the heart of Pittsburgh Jewish community pool\n[laughter] that's a good question Michael and actually that does have something to do with it my my daughter who's who's safe\nWho's safe you praise praise God she and five other girls all about the age of sixteen sixteen to fourteen Thirteen something like that they were going to end opus days center and opus day is the kind of very popular\nUm lake group lay orderly ministry and the Catholic Church and the meats just really pretty much right across the street from from the synagogue tree of life synagogue\nI drop them off there are many Saturdays usually about one Saturday a month and and and it's ironic Michael the last time that we went by\nWe took a very close look at the synagogue and and I was reading it there's Hebrew written on and I can't read Hebrew but also English and and they said dad so what what does that me and I said well I I don't know real well but I think it's probably a pretty conservative orthodox\nA synagogue right and and I and I remember my thing you know the these folks are friends right we we aligned with ah with these folks so close on so many things\nCulture um you know politically I'm even faith wise even though you know we're Catholics and they're Orthodox Jews and I remember saying these are our friends these are good allies\nThat they are and never and I thought this would have happened\nI should I should make clear on H. I. M. congregation tree of life congregation\nOr if it was a conservative synagogue and conservative Judaism is sort of the middle branch it has more traditional than reform\nBut it is not orthodox and what's fascinating about this is that the evil killer a and we we talked about this before she came in at nine forty five which is right when services we're supposed to start\nAnd run of the characteristics particularly of orthodox and conservative Judaism is no one comes on time\nAs if I had the services are long\nAnd people don't show up on time and they they kind of wander in and then probably had at or their\nOwn speed and catch up it's just the tour reading where you you actually read from the ... is a and an ... a portion of the ... people are reading around the world that's really the center of the service where everybody would hopefully be caught up or come before that starts\nAt and yeah and my daughters they they pulled off about nine fifty five\nAnd ... their thing was going to start at ten and our friend Suzie family friend the mother of one of the girls was driving and they pulled right across from the synagogue right across the street and she was going to drop them off they they were going to walk over to the house\nAnd then soon as he had this kind of got feel that I should just maybe pulled down the street a little bit more and walk them in today\nSo she pulled them or a little bit more an extra minute or two and and at that point cars started flying in police cars they the cars returns sideways they basically barricaded the road police jumped out with heavy artillery they're using their vehicles as barricades shields\nAnd soon as you said to my my my two daughters there and and their friends she said you girls we better not get out you better get down\nSo they they locked the car doors and they they dock below the windows and we about ten sixteen my wife and I just happened to be in Pittsburgh we were driving now liberty avenue and my wife got attacks from my daughter said pray for us\nI Will call you later and my wife said\nRecalling now it is I Want to see ... see yeah so you say you\nYeah what do you see\nYeah so so you ... and and basically you describe in your your piece in American Spectator a report from Pittsburgh it's posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com along with information about Paul's wonderful book a pope and a president\nOr ... you described in there how they waited out they duct in in the van they were writing in and then finally they were able to drive a little bit out of harm's way\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that it's it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years\nAnd but bless Italy there aren't that many of them and stuff\nBut most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or ... even in the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a a a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there\nAnd the grandson was killed two for us singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I immediately thought of it because it at first we didn't know who was doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date\nOctober twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics classic grow City College we had just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three\nWhich it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday\nSo I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack and unfortunately it wasn't that had nothing to do with that but that this was just some loan wacko ... a Nazi apparently a who and I and the worst thing about something like this is\nI don't know what you could even do to stop it other than better surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the survey and like I Would say this people listening\nIf you know somebody on Facebook or on social media who was posting vile hateful things like this was bragging about his weapons collection\nAnd and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the whatever synagogue to to beat up some juice you get on the phone and just call the police\nBoxer his ads say the hell deliver a knockout punch the

those things that what is what is very clear about about Andrew Jackson and many people neglect about him because he um he did enjoy ah drinking ah never drank to access that we know of\nHe um he

the United states eleven people\nMurdered in a synagogue during what we call it ...\nA British which is where in a jail boy circumcised and baby naming ceremony takes place at that point this is a conservative synagogue not politically conservative synagogue a religiously\nConservative synagogue in Judaism in American Judaism anyway there's several branches of Judaism I'm an Orthodox Jew which means deeply observing keeps habit don't drive on Saturday keep kosher there's conservative Judaism which is\nSort of less orthodox people thrive on Saturday sort of a form of habit or they don't keep kosher but they have certain respect for it to our laws in any case\nThis concern in Senegal didn't have much security and an anti Semitic white supremacist\nI keep myself walk into the synagogue armed with an arcane and proceeded to shoot up the Brits me like he was screaming at the time all Jews must die so obviously saw fellow\nSo why does this matter of personal I I think that we need to get something off the table right away when an anti Semitic attack occurs\nYou generally don't need to bother blaming particular politicians anti Semitism is literally as old as the Jewish people literally as old as the Jewish people in other politicians and pass will call for anti Semitism their politicians in the past will actively called for the murder of Jews\nI'm not saying a lot of those on today's American thing there are a lot of politicians on Native American team will hobnobbing with anti Semite who make common cause with anti Semitic we'll get to all of that in just a second but

at you and that's not say that America's violent country for ... it is not America is the safest country in world history purchase\nAmerica's incredible place for June but because the Jewish population is so small and because so many Jews know each other and because the Jews sort of consider themselves and extended family just as Christians consider themselves and extending religious

cook closely bound unit Jewish identity isn't really a choice it's a reality\nMajority has obscured this for a lot of trees but the fact is that all Jews are in the same boat when it comes to anti
