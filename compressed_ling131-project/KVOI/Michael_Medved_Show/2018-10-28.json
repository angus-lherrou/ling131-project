um ten thirty ... voice out of court terror Tucson and they have a handyman haven radio studio\nWe talked a little bit in the past about um the wood products and engineered what products and a lot of the information that's available you can obtain it on the Web is that the American plywood association dash engineered would\nAnd that in itself has a very exhaustive ... description of a lot of things are concerning engineered would as well as apply was a little bit about plywood supply was\nI came in existence a which is a rather surprising\nIf I remember correctly was in the late Eighteen hundreds\nThat the uh uh first a designation of plywood came about\nAnd along that same time period the or in the Boston or early Nineteen hundreds is when the four by a cheat the four foot by eight foot she became the a\nPrimary size of four of plywood now today the unique thing about a plywood itself or as well as many engineered woods or they can go all the way up to five feet which is sixty inches by twelve feet which is a hundred and forty four inches\nSo they are available on special order do you have any desire for obtaining some of these we do have a source for those we do use them in a production of a lot of our counter tops\nI did talk a little bit earlier about a a counter tops set a handyman haven again just to reiterate\nWe can get you ten feet of a laminate counter top with a ah backslash already mounted on that counter top in a code fashion a four Ninety bucks so that's a quite reasonable if you want to build up Gunter we can also accommodate you on any sort of that build up\nA little bit about engineered words why that this is so sensitive to me especially those that are clients come into our store and they ask for a solid wood cabinet\nAnd a ride away my ears perk up broke up to try to recognize what the customers really asking for a when they talk about solid wood or the next statement sort of out of there a\nDiscussion is that solid wood is uh nothing associated with particle board so it's a non particle board type or a cabinet tree that they're looking for and yes those cabinets are available as a non particle board\nOr they're normally done with a plywood\nAnd apply would is a special engineered would as well as particle board is a certain engineered would\nThere are three categories a particle board one is find dance the one is medium density and one is I'm sort of wide density and the heaviest or the particle board is defined density because there is more would that have been pressed together in order to form that\nAnd I know a while back we are talking about a a special particle board a dog that was being ordered and the weight of that door because it had to hang on a a a sliding system\nAnd both the customer and myself were concerned with the weight of it since it was a rather huge door is Ninety nine inches tall and it did way I'm extensively on the way we did get a heavy\nUh are tracking\nAs well as a roller system in order to handle that door in the sliding fashion so those things are available from that standpoint\nSo a plywood by definition of the American plywood association is any a slab type would\nAh that has a wood veneer say on one side has an engineering would process on the inside and has another piece of wood veneer on the opposite side and these are the the long sides\nYou go to the the wide liked him for by eight flat surface would be an example of a\nEngineered would product that is considered plywood so what's on the in the correlation between those two pieces of an air I have seen a particle board a fine medium and course grain I have seen medium does the fiber board I've seen high density fiber board\nI have seen several applies of wood that are about a ah sixteenth or an eighth of an inch and thickness\nAnd those places are normally cross Grange or as a stack of upon one another to give them a sufficient strength there's oriented oriented strand board which looks like a wood shavings from a player that have been glued together under pressure\nOr those come in or various sizes as well as the various sicknesses are starting from maybe a an eighth of a quarter inch and they build on up to at least an inch and you may be able to even get some special made ones if you need them\nTo be a an inch and a half inch and a quarter of that fashion so there are lots of water available depending upon what your application is going to be a\nAnd use you can also have plywood as an example of that has a dimensional lumber which is longer that's ... collected or a cut directly from the tree\nAnd let's say a one before one but twelve and that could be embrace with a another would source on the outside of both sides of that as a veneer would veneer\nAnd that can also be considered plywood so another term that is quite frequently use is called plywood core a sheet goods\nWhich is an engineer products or anything can be put in the center that has worked with vinegar on the outside the ... depending upon the thickness of it and that could be considered a plywood corps or a solid would\nWe get involved with words that are we use a lot of in construction such as to before to the Sixers et cetera\nThose may be classified as not only solid wood but a more precise term would be dimensional lumber or solid lumber would of so one before too before for but for eight by eight\nAnd you can imagine maybe an eight by twenty\nAnd I have seen big beams of that nature however I Do caution you if you do get a beam of that nature just imagine the size of the tree it comes from there'll be a large expense for you and I would venture to say that that piece of wood will work twist in band\nAnd get it to be nice and straight were the two pieces match up\nSo what they finally settled on was rather interesting they are wanted all eight foot pieces they needed to have I Believe four pieces generally five pieces\nSo they want her job all eight foot pieces and I may be one of them was six feet and they're still going to have the same in the middle of the counter top but it was going to be minimized as they try to joined the two pieces together\nOr could not get the accurate measurement that we needed to see if\nThe or the twelve foot countertop would have worked we do know that many time periods the countertops come in about an inch longer than one forty four as an example\nThey alluded to the fact that maybe it was one forty four a and a half of one forty four and three quarters and we may have been able to get that accomplish if we can get the accurate measurements so that is important when you're building a counter drops to have the accurate measurements\nYou may have heard of 'em are Sean ... on his program earlier talking about education along with mark or the advertisement that was on just previous to this segment talked about education on her behalf of the Bruce ...\nOther people running for office and I can't say that a ... knowing basic math and I'm not talking about high powered triggering on the tree calculus of statistics are integral a integration of things of that nature\nUh I'm not talking about that type of math I'm just talking about maybe reading a basic tape measure\nI don't know where this has been lost in our education but when\nWhen somebody comes in the store and says they want to buy a door and I asked him how why did they want the door they say well they want an eighty inches wide and I said well that sounds like the height of the door that doesn't sound like the with so I said oh the with the door has got to be twenty two and three small lines\nAnd of course my ears perk up right away a twenty two and three small lines so how am I going to handle that so I bought my big tape measure\nShow them whether it's funny to mark is showing where the twenty three and mark is and say okay which one of these small lines are you interested in\nAnd uh this\nLooks like a deer in headlights folks their eyes open up why they don't know what what that means that somebody's just told them twenty two and three small lines\nSo I Know this one case the customers decided to a call the other partner at home\nAnd I'm not trying to be sexist and this nature that was a woman that asked for this and said that she was going to call her husband\nAnd secretly I said to myself Oh thank goodness will maybe get the answer to this question so after three or four minutes to discussion discussion on the telephone because I can only hear one side of it and it looked like we were going to get the final decision of what the dimension was going to be\nAnd uh after she hung up she said yeah my husband just said that was going to be twenty two and three small lines\nSo here's two people in the home that do not know how to read a tape measure\nAnd needless to say I I could not on or what their request says I can get them a twenty four inch door and with and then they can take it home and cut it to whatever dimension they want but that's not what they wanted to do\nSo education is really very very important um reading a tape measure I don't remember oh where in school at that came about but it may not even be a tape measure how about just one of the old fashioned twelve intruders that we used to have that had a metal bar on one side in order to give you an eye straight edge\nSo if you learn how to reader reader ruin or you can surely we read a tape measure whether it's twenty five feet long with us one hundred and fifty to two hundred and feet are the small lines are always have the appropriate designation for the number of them that are between ... inch march from that standpoint\nSo everybody listening out there and check with your children check with your grandchildren and allow them to figure out and understand and educate them about how to read a tape measure\nSo keep that in mind I'm so it's so I should have counter tops can be rather tricky because as most people know the a Ninety degree corners in a room that happens to be a way it is may not quite be at Ninety degrees\nAnd the walls may not be plum which is a vertical aspect of it and they may not be a straight or flat they maybe weren't be a little bit\nThe corners may not be at Ninety degrees and you could sort of expect that if you put a framing square on it which is a square that's Eighteen Inches by two feet within Ninety degree corner if is off one inch in two feet\nAt the end of four feet is going to be off two inches the under six feet is going to be off three inches if the for the wall maintains the linear relationship that we've just measured\nAnd that in itself can cause a tremendous amount of discomfort in trying to install a counter top\nWe can special make countertops at a handyman haven we can go out and template that for you we can get a backslash debts will go on to that type of counter top and you'll have a counter top that well nobody you know that you had cricket walls and a corner that was not at Ninety degrees\nSo give us a call come down and see us and we'll help you\nUnderstand some of the basic highschool geometry that you need to go through to I'm a figure out what's taking place as far as what your walls are doing\nWhen they come back from our next break I'm going to uh discuss with you or some aspects of some

you exactly Roger I'm\nGoing going back one of the first you were told you couldn't go to MIT you you you want a full scholarship there while you were there a you became the editor of computers and all of the nation magazine correct that's correct yes\nAnd and that really gave me a chance to get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product finer so\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that with a big help or because they knew my name and and the my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up of who set up a census of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you've got while you're at MIT but he stayed with it when you graduated correct\nThat's right yeah when as an editor or without talking to the heads of the computer companies\nAnd helping them or you know told me that they had a need for this Fisher\nUm and when I propose the price he said that was too low I should charge more so that would be taken seriously I Love that\nIdea and that type of put out the proposal\nThen wound up having a nine companies and me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that is actually all the capital that I used to get started so\nI have two or anyone asked me about how to start a business I I just talked to people who can be customers find out drunk and failed needs and propose to fill those needs and in many cases they'll they'll sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are closely in touch with their customers they'll\nThey'll be happy to support you\nWell absolutely and and you know there's there's a real important an adult lessons here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years a number of years ago or sixties\nYeah with a ... there and that's about\nA six three three sixty three ... and ... was there his job is to go all over the country as he said\nAnd gather information a world of computers were number this is back in the sixties he'd build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of where they were all located now the ... the last thing I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a bland new publication and you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we're interested in and you know you can do it on your own\nUh so I said fine I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computers manners they said they needed a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what were their problems and difficulties and\nWe launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us they couldn't be done we're only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and we'll ... we'll pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went all the one that was a bad market and we'll save money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got very little advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription advances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat now you go do that we're not interested or tell us folks um how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've I put in I sold my car and put in five thousand dollars that with all my proceeds available and\nThen I went to my sister and I went to the\nFirst person either employed do ... general manager and said would you be willing to invest in support me in this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know the thing the risky they don't always succeed so\nWe're going to give you ten dollars while if you're a cat here like adventure your capital availability\nSo so your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bill from your wife and a manager you my sister and them out of ...\nI'm Sorry your yeah your sister diminishing rights so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic before ... ... and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors gave you the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars today it's\nA million dollars say the today\nA facility unbelievable absolutely amazed and they told you couldn't be done\nRight which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was that easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so\nWhen they say it can't be that and that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and that just by energetically keeping in touch with the customer the prospects you often find ways\nThat they would like to see the service provider that no one else is to get it and then you can charge in and you know for a given something that really want and you know ethically support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is eager to success but when ... when you're growing it business no matter what stage it is pat isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical element that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to them and listening to what they need some simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right that when people ask me oh what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lot of physical energy because if you have to put Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days you know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit but\nDon't you spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans\nBecause uh uh but you said that there was work your plan but you should do with work and market going out and finding out what people want their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to\nYou know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up sometime you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said that is very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneur is America the wealthiest most successful never really had a formal written business plan and if they did they usually pulled out\nA I've found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas and your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're glowing from a from a regional business you know start up you mentioned some of the critical element what about growing for regional to national what are those next critical steps to grow a business even further but\nOf course you had to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country the people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is to begin to move into other countries and are there the the key step is to go over and you know and and actually make discussions with the proposed customers to make sure they\nSee the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who uh shares your passion for the moment of those needs\nAnd has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire and motivate good people and then you know give them the resources they want or give them an encouragement and support get out of their way but then you know just to their local market and just provide them help and assistance but not try to tell them how to do it because\nYou're never going to fully understand the foreign market where the local person who live within the culture every day is\nGoing to be much more able to move quickly adjusted changes within that market\nYou know another point you came up with that you shared with me in the past is that um decentralization was important to you and and you you you'd um hold in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty is very key to the close to your business on your business units can you share with that number one fifty is so important okay\nYeah that's our average a business guy you know I ... I found early on that I was I was like a typical entrepreneur I wandered control everything make sure everything was happening in a way I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control it actually selling the growth of the business and that's why I really have the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not my control but\nFinding fertile markets and good at getting an enthusiastic leader and then I found that morale or I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that\nAre the morale was her pick that about a hundred and fifty people are the people at that stage they knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of why they're role with how important in the company and they were all you know work together as a unified team I ... and it's interesting because that's sort of\nA you know we have people grow up in the ah families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA typically like twelve people in the family to tell you a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of human beings who move around a and conduct all their activities and\nWell there is a um you know usually increase the way that I think maybe it's it's partially that there's something in the pollution in the environment that is causing this to increase by\nPartially that the ability to recognize that an early stage a mistake or you know situation artistic development allows for more cases to be reported\nBy the autism is actually is at fault in the early neurological development of a child which\nAh causes a ... a part of the brain to a accelerated development that often you know has\nA quantitative factual types of skills but um diminishes the social sensitivity and social interaction capability so that you wind up having\nYou know people who can be um a brilliant mathematician and you know it can multiply to twenty digit numbers together or can\nHear a piano concerto wants to repeat it exactly and do amazing things\nIn the specialized part of the brain that are related to math and music yet um you know they have very little sensitivity to other people they can't read another person's mood or file and you know they they walk away from people there really isolated a socially\nSo uh what we hope our research will do is to identify what the biochemical\nOr other action and they are developing brain and often this is you know that much more frequent and and males and females that causes the development of this artistic uh situation so that can be prevented or hopefully even reversed in cases where you know the child is now five or six seven years old\nIt's amazing and I understand that the the ... statistics these days are one in one hundred and sixty six children one out of one sixty six has autism\nAh that that's really tragic ... it's such a hardship for the parents involved and and also requires lifetime often very lifetime special attention so many other people need to get involved to help your child is inadequate like\nWell I commend you and your wife are doing a a a tremendous job understanding as five hundred researchers that location I Wish you the best of success with that and we get back in this mess break all you're quite welcome and we get back from this next break down I'm going to ask you a pat\nWhat are some of the unexpected challenges entrepreneur as a business owners don't know they're obviously doing expect they don't know what the unexpected challenge is the one into maybe can help 'em out without a little\nOkay ladies gentleman ... founder chairman of international data group will be back right after this legends of success\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategy and we transform typical portfolios that depend on speculative gross into portfolios that generates sustained retirement income for life in right now we're offering the latest books from\nOur founder David ...

and his wife\nJust days before the bomb scare you spoke with Senator Ben Sasse recent he authored the book\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal senator\nWhat did you make a bad audio I'm sure you've seen the tape or Nancy Pelosi was also assaulted this weekend what do you make of this\nYet to what end what are these people think their goal is because a ... right now there are so many people who are allowing their political options to swallow up everything else in their lives\nThat they're thinking it's normal to just scream of people at a restaurant throw their food on the table is not a question about whether or not your First Amendment rights allow you to protest they certainly do but America starts with a fundamental assumptions about what the good life is and we don't think that power is the end power as a means to maintain order so that people are going to have\nDinner time discussion and debate with family and friends that even people that don't agree with

I think we're headed to a dark place and I think there are a lot of political addicts out there that are not really reach us great four and five yet\nA centers as you have written a brand new book them which I Want to talk about it my copy is in Virginia but I'll still talk to you about it but I Do believe\nIn that tape you heard part of the problem I'm going to sell it to see 'em we monetize confrontation we've actually made it profitable and a path to celebrity\nTo be a jerk and yell and scream at ...\nA path to celebrity to be a jerk and to yell and scream at people I don't know that the people as you say about three and four and five moves that because that's a path that goes towards ever increasing confrontation\nYeah well said I I really do think we we have but we don't have a shared understanding across three hundred twenty billion of of\nOf the moment in which we're living both in media consumption and media maybe at the subset of technology more broadly I think the big tension and our bowl but that would be useful for us to reflect on it and a lot of why I wrote the book\nIs the tension between ruthlessness and rudeness to happiness literature is showing us something that you know sort of thoughtful people and give people who have grandparents that older wisdom in their life has probably knows for millennia but\nThere are about four things that Dr happy that you have a nuclear family you have a couple of friendship yeah meaningful work shirt vocation and co workers and do you have a local worshipping community\nThose four ingredients are basically what Dr whether or not happy that's all the all that stuff is about ... and our technology is allowing us to start to think of ourselves is completely ruthless\nAnd the way that we're consuming media and the way that we're thinking about political tribalism is a function of that sort of the of the mindset your flag right there\nI'm sure you read David Brooks his column the rich white civil war last week based on the hidden tribes study and it is in fact not a problem of the center is a problem of the extremes on the left and right\nThat they caught so we want to catapult abuse at each other but it's also one that is powered by anonymity and I'm Wondering senators now what do you think of an anonymous comments and the tenor they bring to our politics\nYeah great great flags on both quite so first of all I think that the study of art you hit fraud is great every your listenership go read it a David Brooks fees the New York times early last week was one of the memories of it\nAnd one of the things that he says that so really it is when you take a part of these demographers and social scientists started to look at America and figure out where are we on politics and so off that we just think of it as right versus left\nBut there is another dimension which is\nIntensity of thinking that politics should crowd out the rest of life\nOn the second or third most conservative voter and the U.S Senate but I'm a huge skeptical about the idea that you can put politics at the center of your life and actually live well and love your neighbor well what what books like was two of the stuff that\nTribes that are identified in that study hidden Dr two of the stuff that are most politically it or the eight percent on the far left that pay constant attention to politics that are rich and the white\nAnd the six percent on the far right the pay constant attention to politics the rich and white and eighty six percent of America is saying go away you people are weird\nPolitics is a means to an end so that I can coach little league and live in my local community and this idea that politics should crowd everything else out it's it's wrong or it's never been an American I yeah and right now a huge part of what we are going through um is that fourteen percent telling the eighty six percent\nYou're weird that you want to live in communities the eighty six percent or right\nHas American interests closer to election day twenty Eighteen voter interest is extremely high especially among Republicans one of the common themes among Democrats that was the claim that Republicans are using voter id to suppress already vote\nAnybody ever asked minorities about his ears leery of syndicated Salem soccer\nHolding in my baby brown libertarian fingers were going to put up on Larry Elder dot com an article from the national review August twenty three twenty sixteen the majority of minorities support voter ID laws\nDoesn't mean that the voter ID laws weren't racist right doesn't mean they are disproportionately negatively affect the people of color it just means that people recover too stupid to realize\nAccording to Gallup Seventy seven percent of Americans Hispanics in Seventy two percent of blacks support voter ID laws quote the figure is essentially the same among white eighty one percent back voter ID laws into quote\nYou don't you know anybody that doesn't have ID and if you know somebody doesn't have ID does that person not have the ability to\nGet id and if you don't have id you really think that\nSuch a person is motivated to vote in the first place army Horowitz went out to ask white people what they thought about voter ID laws and on and on and on these a white college kids start to voter ID laws racist why because they thought black people were just two incapable or stupid to get id\nKevin opinion voter ID laws easy for you maintain\nTheir voter ID laws our way to perpetuate that down there but it's hard to say those are those laws are lakes as some of these they're less likely to have\nState IDs minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of I mean I'm described\nOr require the type of people don't live in areas with easy access to the Emmys or the placement and get identification can always get 'em over the Internet and also with that make it difficult for people to go\nYeah you have to have access to the Internet you have to be able to pay an Internet service provider for some have anything\nThat's harder for black people to go on line they don't have the knowledge of how like how it works out flat falling behind and they don't really know that they're not aware that important\nNow I'm hearing he's Harlem black people their thoughts on what you just heard you have ID throwing\n... said I Do carry id yes I you know what
