one who's ... who's going to end yep two thousand and eight right\nYep January first two thousand and eight was our first day\nWow okay on the very first of the year what was the what was the economy like then what was the kind of the economic outlook that you pick\nThe Tucson economy was very weak at that time and um the\nThe the US Economy it was going through the housing bubble at the time so it was a tough time to start a business\nAs well put it mildly [laughter] yeah to see the very least that was a really really tough time\nTo be starting a business and you were starting a business in competition with some major players right Office Depot staples office max I think those those guys we're all here than\nI'm well Office Depot in office max had physical storefronts at that time and within two to three years staples came into town opening up three stories in one shot\nAnd um when suddenly enough all three stories or that since closed up and running still around [laughter]\nOkay so all three staples are gone about Office Depot in office max\nI'm most a lot of their storefront they'd closed down also but yeah they'll say they have like one or two stuff floating around\nYeah there might be a they might have some presence in town but nothing like it was back then so basically\nFive or six of your major big box competitors went out of business in the office supply business in Tucson but Gerry of road runner office supply is still going I Want to know what your secret is Jerry how did you do that you didn't have the depth of pockets you\nWhen you bring in and new

know delivering product to your customers to your local customers\nWhat do you spend time with him personally training them how how does that happen\nOh absolutely um in fact we just hired a new driver a couple of weeks ago and the first week of um his training is actually need doing that deliveries along with him and showing him the process and\nUm main things that I actually try\nAnd ... and ingrained in his head is speed at the deliveries that's not the important part important part is that when you walk in you walk in with a smile and you um\nJust have a good persona about you and you do that delivering the right way not this any way putting it where they want it making sure they're happy and then going you're merry way to the next delivery\nAnd I'm\nJust basically ... that I'm One of my important tended to or it might drivers and do any of my employees\nYeah I think you know it's a funny thing because you get\nIf you're if you're a delivery time person right you you you probably got more stops to making a date and maybe you want to make and so you get in a hurry you get your your vehicle your driving you know you're trying to to be efficient and get it get it done but then when you show up at a customer location you kinda gotta change modes\nAnd all of a sudden it becomes not about you but about that customer\n... exactly\nYeah exactly and you know what driving

must be to work for local office supply company they do deliveries next day on everything no minimum order and if you get a office furniture\nFrom Jerry will come out and assemble it at no charge and this this man is a\nHe is a master at a furniture assembly as he should be after twenty five or Thirty years of doing it so it's it's a work of art a lot of times people like to put on one of Beethoven symphony is Jerry assembles or furniture\nAnd almost make an event out of it there at the office so that's an option for you had a chance to talk with Jerry about something called\nConscious capitalism\nWhich is a an international group founded by John Mackey the founder of whole foods market John founded that company back in Nineteen eighty he and his hippy girlfriend he was a hippie to make no bones about it socially progressive opened up there in Austin or a a\nStore a a an organic you know precursor that was called safer way\nAnd he got involved in the Austin co-op community lots of a\nFood co-op going on around there all of them of course turn a socialist leanings and John being an idealist really thought that this was going to work out great\nAnd then but he became disillusioned because they couldn't make any money they did a lot of bickering between each other and instead of really focusing on how to deliver great products to their customers they they've targeted or other less socially conscious members of the business community and spin\nUh other less socially conscious members of the business community and spend all their energy going after them will after a couple of years the ... the producer a Tom here's wanting to know if it's safe for\nSafer way has something to do is safe way it's hard to get anything passed ... and I think he's probably right safer way anyway they did this for a couple of years got disillusioned with it but they had a lot of believers\nIn what you know what they were trying to do and so they got some investors and they opened the first whole foods market there in Austin in Nineteen eighty\nAnd within a couple of years it had become and mentally popular they were doing a ton of business that community love them the concept was starting to be a starting to get some notoriety beyond just to Austin in Texas and then in Nineteen I Believe was Nineteen eighty\nThree Austin went through the worst flooding in its history and a ruined that whole foods market it flooded the market destroyed all of their product destroyed all of their merchandising\nAnd much of their building they didn't have insurance to cover this they lost everything in that flood\nAnd what happened they were I mean there was bankrupt as you can get and what happened was\nTheir customers showed up as soon as the wander reached seeded with mumps and buckets their bankers showed up with the same thing and their suppliers did the same thing they got the place cleaned up got to put back together the bankers extended them a line of credit and put them back in business\nAnd that was what John Mackey calls his first awakening in business and understanding the importance of\nA stakeholder community and that's when he ... the first time he realized\nThat stakeholders include many more people other than just stock holders their stockholders are certainly important\nAnd he was the stock holder and uh and as a business partner you have at the time\nThey were stockholders but there were many others who were stakeholders and without those stakeholders without the buy in from those stakeholders whole foods market or as we know it would never have come into existence ... would not have been bought out by Amazon if that hadn't happened\nBut uh so anyway I thought that was an amazing story and really demonstrated the importance the significance of a long term perspective on your business and one of the big big problems in corporate America the day especially publicly traded corporate America is that CEOs\nAnd board board members are under so much pressure to deliver\nWhat happens is when you're in the machine all of your blood rushes cheer for and it goes into kind of the fight or flight loads you know and\nI'm as you step back now you know the blood is oxygen aided\nNutrient rich flushing toxins and the brain cells all this awesome name blood where to go which is where you're paying ...\nOkay so you know go in this thing and it's so cold the blood rushes to your core 'cause it's kind of trying to save your life then all these nutrients go with it and and all those activities happening at\nYour inflammation yeah\nOkay so I think we have somebody who's a somebody wants to call him do have dom okay we got a lady named Judith Judith are you there Hi this is Judith Blair I

Kobe Bryant Steph Curry San ...

talk about the inflammation a little bit I Know a lot of people have inflammation in you know in a lot of different ways\nYeah myself I'm myself I'm also a lot of inflammation so um yeah so again it reduces inflammation\nAnd um I mean I just couldn't live without this um you know it keeps me from walking like a Ninety year old you know yeah it's amazing\nYeah that's great well I think that uh

temperature drops in all of a sudden everything kind of all the energy is redirected the core of your body kind of in survival mode um that your metabolism is also elevated at that point to the to the extent that\nYou burn up five to eight hundred calories related to just a short session\nRight that right I I personally have lost thirty pounds already\nIn there and you've done that in in what period of time\nUm I Would say and about three months\nThree months now and you haven't been hitting the gym two times a day he just didn't do\nMy injuries are so bad that I I I I'm In pain if I work

Center for innovation it's another great program which is really like a life cycle I'm you know a incubator right they take from like idea but they'll carry through investment they'll carry through launched through those different types of things um\nBut the thing that doesn't exist in in living that life is\nThat preceded that very early stage that is hyper focused on\nSilicon Valley best practice of hyper growth tech enabled companies right that doesn't exist right now um and you know giving entrepreneurs that range of flavors\nUm I think is one of the best things that we can do for an ecosystem it's not about um you know land grab it it's not about ownership and what we should seize synergy using these I should see lifestyle entrepreneurs launch and go you know what I got an idea that's way bigger than this thing and working on and I would love to see them come to founder Institute and I would love a founder it's to graduate\nTo find some traction and then go engage uneasy CI and go how can I take this further how can I run with this beyond just is fourteen we program I mean if we're building ecosystem right\nAll of these things come together to build what we really want out of Tucson and that is for founder at any level\nOr an entrepreneur somebody that's ready to innovate at any level can enter in and find all the hand off not just the specific programs right one and done aren't going to work for us anymore right we need a specific programs that intertwined and then actually bring you know the success that that they're looking for in an ecosystem looks for\nI Love it I I'm I received that back to the push back a little bit and I completely agree and so you said a couple of things\nA land grab and synergy [laughter] um and we worked on an ecosystem related project called un summit su San in late September and that was to do those very things\nAh with the the the you got to work on it and we weren't coming with an organizational had just a a and the fact that 'cause he's a lot of people who are these guys and guy up so we were wearing the Tucson brand so we weren't coming in for land grab try to say that our organization we're going to put this has been on to support\nOur organization we came as to ... to find\nEcosystem center jeez I'm a to figure out how we could work together to build an environment where these entrepreneurial adventures along all parts of the spectrum you could grow and thrive\nAre so thank you for segue into that [laughter] um ... what are what are some things that you are hearing founders struggling with\nIn Tucson um what are some\nUh if someone is looking to Tucson to start start up yeah what are some things that make us a great place to do that right now and what are some areas where right now we're still weak on\nTo that are holding us back from getting where we want to be\nAbsolutely yeah so let me start with the the positives and there's there's numerous positive that the you know and I'm not just saying it because I'm born and raised here I there are some really great things that occur here I'm but I'm so on the positive side first and foremost culture\nMil this is bill ... many people ask me what it will take to make our community a better place well it takes all of us our greatest resources are retired people with a lifetime of experience skills and

into the creativity show where we are having what I'm calling founder day on the creative city show we are talking to founders and about founders about a starting tech companies integrity companies\nIn Tucson I'm joined in the studio or on my right or by Luis ... from in house\nAnd on my left a meal translate from segment\nLike the rain I and a a meal I had a a a brief chance to explain his company well we'll get back to you again you can go more in depth but uh just to keep things fair and equal or we're going to jump or we're going to start this segment with 'em all the weeds first things for\nA coming down to the studio and uh tell me about your company and how you got to I'm starting it and finding it here in white Tucson way back then\nWe'll get a ... um so yeah I'm In a house is a a data in coal marketing platform for mortgage lenders and realtors we technically help or lenders be able to build a pipeline of borrowers through their realtor partners\nUm and we decided to launch in Tucson because this is sort of um where my career in real estate began I I'm through college I did a lot of Web development in ... in um marketing design work for realtors\nFound a niche market there for whatever reason and I learned about what they need 'em and then ended up watching a business with our partner with with my business partners\nAre we actually won free office space I'm with the competition in town and that prompted us to stay here Dr Neko working and we it was six months of free space but we ended up spending you know three years there now so um yeah\nWow six months to three years and years and uh you know or just for the sake of time 'cause this could be a whole interview on its own debt but Luis in a meal actually and I were all talking at an event recently about how um there's a lot of McGuire entrepreneur is that come out of the hill who don't stay\nUm you know once they graduate college and that in terms of telling the stories and storytelling well the successes in Tucson not only did you you know you went through McGuire you came out of it\nYou know your six months and now it's been three years that have been started in Tucson that's a story we're\nFailing and congratulations yeah thanks yeah incredible yeah a lot of people just leave to California or to the next you know next to big city but yeah and I mean there's many good reasons for that and we're not criticizing personal and business decisions but we want to see those entrepreneurs like yourself stay in the city\nYou know even through the first few years of sending a company and gift he's on a shot so that's kind of our theme today so it's cool that you've you've lived that out so yeah yeah super\nA and a meal or or you have um a little bit of a different story um are you are um\nA bit of a different story um are you are a part of the Canadian invasion\nYeah that's very true I've just recently survived my second summer summer am in the desert now so I'm I'm I'm sure glad the or the seasons are changing a little I'm not used to this yet I think it might take you know ten years [laughter] so we heard a little bit\nAbout your company if you had to explain it in one sense or on this side of the break or what would that be and then how did you get to Tucson why are you still hear\nSo I'll say this fake things are bad like fake medicine is bad it hurts a lot of people killed but a million people a year and we can solve that problem\nLike he's done that yeah [laughter] yeah they're basically your technology allows for better verification\nYeah and it's it's really cool you know just with a modern smartphones you just uh you know walk up to Madison bottle that has our technology and uh and just tap it kind of like a path to pay a which your credit card and it'll tell you for sure if it's a genuine uh Madison and if it's ever been tampered with her opened or anything like that so\nI'm not such a big deal right now you know when you go to your local pharmacy here in Tucson that's not a huge concern for you but there's many parts of the world where it's a it's a daily struggle\nRight yeah I mean there's business concerns or social good concerns you you cover\nYou cover the gamut I mean we could even be talking about wind that is sold as a certain age and then it shipped as not at that age and your technology helps to make sure that you're getting what you were yeah I mean there's so many applications we we probably can't go into too many of them but\nWe we shouldn't will will be here for a long time yeah\nYeah yeah we um we're doing our best to have a a rocky an episode here with the ... but each of your companies should have really their own episodes we might have to do that\nOr at some point but um how are the want to make sure we covered this before we had to our second to last break here uh how has that experience been in Tucson and the the experienced the last\nTwo to three years 'cause that like the range we're talking about what's been the highs and lows the challenge is\nNot so much about the entrepreneurial journey as much as the ecosystem so as a founder of a tech company in Tucson or what has gone well and and and what could be could be better and it started with Luis\nOkay yeah I mean so I think the ecosystem here um it's really helpful well I I think two sons or the fact that it's it's a cheap to live here I'm In is not costly to to run a business here I think that helped us out a lot that was really awesome for us\nUm I think there's a lot of resources out there you know with coming from from the ... program that was a great resource to us you were tapped into straight to the investor groups we were you know connected with a network of McGuire graduates across the globe so that was really useful for us or being able to whenever we had a question or\nYou know of an issue to tap into that network that was incredibly useful um [noise] uh you know we also got to participate in pitch competitions there's quite a bit of those um and so given the opportunity to win prizes to to get recognition and the community that was something that Tucson and and the McGuire program did a very well for us\nUm I think uh some of the things that maybe need improvement is the connectivity between 'em all the other programs in Tucson there's quite a bit more than just McGuire program um and we came from the ... program so we had sort of you know we were there um but we wish we could have been connected with\nYour felt more um ah connected with like ... sort of Tucson or or the other programs that were here which are at the time when we launch we felt separate it or not quite meshed um if that makes any sense um\nWow yeah you know what's interesting is um like I said in the beginning of the show a it's almost an accident that the the three of the four of us are airing on the last couple of segments and then you guys\nUm it was almost by accident that we got here on the same day and we didn't compare notes that everything you mentioned Aaron mentioned as well yeah ... which is\nShows the challenge um but from the runway to find the funding you know you can you can live longer on started funding here and then you could maybe and of course Silicon Valley or either side you know either coast and the connectivity um is a is a huge issue um that's super interesting has an improved since you started\nI think so I think yeah definitely I mean being just involved in it takes the entrepreneur to push to you know we can't expect sure someone else to build the ecosystem for us we have to participate in it and so I think the moment that much him and I started doing that um\nWe've noticed maybe what needed to change and we participate in that and I think since our inception two years ago where I guess for years now um I've definitely seen great improvements in that um there's momentum that's growing now we see a lot of new groups coming up and um you know exciting times\nFor sure so awesome yeah yeah I'm a meal or same same question or what's been what's been a great pro and what's been a challenging con\nAs communities and a new look at successful ecosystems there's risk takers that's not just the entrepreneur that's also the private sector and venture capital and and all that so that's what I'm hearing a from you guys thank you for coming down in the studio um and\nSharing your advice for what you mean I Do this community keep on any way that we can report you um we will I think you guys so much they make you Tucson you've been

some all kinds of attack weapons assault weapons\nThat are really weapons of war there is no reason that that individual citizen should actually be owning those I mean we had a ban on them they've already banned for many years for a decade and a one of the public ... took control of both houses of Congress they\nCouldn't wouldn't pass that band and we really need to move in that direction many

that we want to represent our district\nMy name is Nick Pearson and I approve this message please vote for me on November six paid for by Pearson for Congress\nFormer Congressman Ron barber during the summertime [laughter] he's got warm by congressman thanks so much\nFor being with us we're really appreciated it was a terribly sad very in America let them dead everybody's trying to guard in Pittsburgh ... president of United States like mom got some good with guns and maybe we should have more security and it just makes me feel sick\nUm I I Believe the rhetoric of the president has laid the foundation for all kinds of terrible things is maybe one of them are what's your thinking their congressmen\nWould I think your comments well taken a you know the president's ah as a family help themselves you know I just watched a clip from his rally and uh\nWhen you thought when he said to his audience is going to tone it down they booed him and so he liked it up again in anything capable of toning it down for about a second\nAnd he has I Believe by his rhetoric a fight is hateful statements as divisive statements\nAnd the things that he senators rally you know punch him in the face I'll pay your bills all I'm Out you know and then the ... the meat demonizing statements he made about people of color and other groups I mean it's just well it'll say he's not the person we want is president the setting a bad over the country\nAnd in that environment people do things or feel encouraged\nAnd in that environment people do things or feel encouraged or permitted or given\nPermission to do things the horrible thing that happened today now the shooter in the Pentagon claims that he didn't like Trump and Trump is certainly telling everybody about that but but the environment we're talking about is one that's created\nFor the first time really by the president United States you know one of the things that I feel is really important for people to think about it is\nWe've always had hate groups we've always had neo Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members all the other people who pedaled that fateful a doctors and they used in the shadows so we've kind of kept them there but this is the first time in my lifetime that I can remember\nThey have a feeling like they were supporting the president of United States the guy down in Florida with all the bombs his vehicle is plastered with\nFolks from a stickers and and and you know targets over the faces of Democrats so you know he has to take the president has to take a lot of his belief\nOr dream or whatever and proper to cancel rally in light of this terrible news is very large number of Jews in one place or\nA ... in in our history or a horrible thing is you know my wife was diversion how'd you benefit from a dog she would have been killed because she was a Jew that's the only reason they die I die because we were Jews think about that just think about that yeah and drive and absolutely\nAnd that's that's just it's just that that's not who we are as Americans you know that's that's something that happens or in another dark place like happened in the in the third Reich when the Jews were terrorized hauled off and killed you know and and these people are Holocaust deniers for the most part\nUh and um we know that that happened and it continues to happen in fact what we've seen over the last three or four years um and it certainly has increased since the president was elected is an increase and hate crimes um be they miner or major like ... today\nAnd I think you know you have to look at the data to see that you've had a spike in this since he became president\nWhen I ask you this will have an effect on them in terms of right around the corner version or congressman or every vote counts you lost more very narrow margin or I've been there myself losing my boss went on a road on\nWho I Am not on I ... or the other one [laughter] and an artist you till you die at that went on it and it never goes away [laughter] true but\nYou know I and I'm enjoying a retirement with my family and my grandkids and also you know it's not all bad\nBut I you know I certainly I Would like to have one but I you know I well here's what I think has to happen\nOn November six we have to have a massive turnout of people who were absolutely disgusted with what's going on because the only way to send a message to people who are supporting the president is old party\nIs to let a whole bunch of them get defeated at the polls I mean I haven't been in Congress than I Am sure you saw it in the state legislature a lot of people just live for one election to the other but they soon as they when they were planning on winning the next time and sometimes this allows people to compromise their values as their\nPrinciples in order to stay in office and that is happening in a huge way in the ... are under this president if you go against him and Europe public and\nYou're going to get treated to death or and or you're going to have someone running a primary against you and\nI get that some people think you know as horrible as he is he's getting get their agenda that but their agenda is not necessarily a very kind and and humanitarian agenda either separating kids of the border acts in a decrease for the rich\nOn and on repealing the health care plan for everybody these are not good policies but these are policies that some in his party one and so I guess they hang in there with him but mostly I think they're afraid\nTo take him on\n... on another front to go some very close races here would approve of recruits in front of our congressmen or congresswoman cinema going against Congress more mature always going to be very close race I think just the mayor percentage point one way or another so McGovern out is going to determine who's going to be the next US Senator for the state of Arizona\nAnd there are some of the question ... going to say anything I and I believe is now a ... to get elected anything I mean it does not make a difference and more I mean it really doesn't do anything for ... or ... minutes you'll say it that I mean it's just she's a classic example\nOf a out of out of a politician who is acts like a wind vein\nWhen the wind blows you east you go east and west you go west I mean it's just the way she works and she has been doing this for the very beginning people say oh she's changed not really\nI ran against for twenty twelve and one I read it gets for twenty fourteen and lost its during that time and I actually back to the primary for the special election in early twenties well her position was pretty far to the right you know when she ran against Jesse Kelly for the nomination\nShe said I'm all I'm a I'm exactly like Jesse Kelly I'm a Tea Party protests that that was what she said in early twenties twelve and his not really different however she has been very artful at avoiding the media\nHad avoiding constituents no town halls no small group meetings only closed door you know media not allow kinds of meetings\nAnd it's going on right now as she avoids the press and or other kind of community uh opportunities [noise] so yeah it's been a long time I mean people are saying oh she's changed her\nShe was a moderate and now she's a Trump or she was never really a moderate she was she has to be very basis and it's like oh she was in\nWhat's going to happen in congressional district to your own or congressional district you your arm or Patrick girl showing or perhaps even a double digit lead at the moment over ... Peterson\nDemocrats are working pretty dramatic bigger work at the polling but you pulling them going to win a race burning well on on election those or will do it so it\nDoes it does not you've got to have a strong field operation which ...\nMeaning you've got to have people all across the district\nWill phone banking walking the neighborhoods in canvassing for you you've got to have enough money to put yourself up on the air and let people know who you are in direct mail and she has done all of those things here's what I've told and as someone who run in the district and who worked with Gabby when she ran in the district\nAnd that is that this is a district that is so tight\nIn terms of being competitive that you never can give up until the last ballot this counted and I found that out obviously and in in in the hardest way possible where there were two hundred and twenty thousand votes cast in our elections twenty fourteen I lost\nA hundred and sixty seven votes\nAnd what we know from that time was that we expected turnout to be forty thousand less\nThan it had been in the presidential year twenty twelve and I want", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "27"}
