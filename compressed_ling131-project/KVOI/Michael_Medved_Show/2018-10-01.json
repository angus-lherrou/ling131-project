House where judge Kavanaugh got a little too snarky he got a little too cocky and got a little too irritated in Europe and and you're right about that\nThat was about one percent of his time before the microphones the other Ninety nine was righteous indignation and solid emphatic denial of exactly the same time that I Would expect from you or me if we're falsely accused of something so\nLet's not you know over analyzed sixty seconds up against it and ultimately you know what really matters is what kind of justice way be what kind of rulings would he ... what ... what do you have any expectation would do you think you would like or not like his views on the high court\nI don't think I got it\nHis views on the high court\nThey are not at all I Know\nThat I I think I think we the

according to the ... and I'm not I don't well okay wait wait wherever you want\nWhile Soviet okay so so so the ... so the the couple of moments where he got a little too snarky\nLook those outweigh the proper indignation that he should 'cause I think a couple of moments ago you said you understood how somebody might react pretty emotionally if they're being falsely accused on me you seem to have some empathy for that\nThere's no evidence to support Dr Ford story none so when I'm getting from years you don't want to talk to the judge Kavanaugh on the court because of like thirty seconds of of conversation with two senators and they're\nNot I don't really know where\nIt is well ... in everybody but I think is right I think his record is fantastic on racial issues in women's issues because people of every race in both sexes disturbing constitution that's respected and and ultimately I think we really just kind of disagree politically on the court and I think that's what's driving

they make me so suspicious\nOf the great moments in the hearings Lindsey Graham going off on his fellow senators is Lindsey Graham being ... actual Spartacus fought against what a ... I'm\nI'm Lindsey Graham here's ... this is the most ethical sham\nSince I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy\nAre you a gang rape that no I cannot imagine what you and your family but going Trish boy all our God I Hope you never get it\nOut the American people can see it as sham that you knew about it and you held it you had no intention of protecting for not she's as much as a victim as your\nGod I hate to say a tough these it than my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this\nYou're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend do you consider this a job interview the advice and consent role is like a job is considered that you've been to a job interview\nI've been through a process of advice and consent under the constitution which you say you've been through hell\nI I've been through a hell and then so\nOkay so now then by the way all now what they say it was a wink since you are right and then you get angry angry angry so now Lindsey Graham goes on George Stephanopoulos and listen to this exchange\nIt appears that the FBI will not be invest it will not be questioning those college witnesses you contradict Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about his drinking oh isn't that relevant given that there clearly was drinking going on at least it's a lot of the party\nNo I think ah you're trying to betray him as a stumbling bottling dropped gang rape best who during high school and college was Bill Cosby six F. B. I. background checks over the years or whatever I uncovered this okay\nNow I Want you to remember who George Stephanopoulos says I'm going to get to the point of this here's a George Stephanopoulos from the documentary called the war the worm was built by Hillary Clinton to defend Bill Clinton from the accusations of women credible accusations that he had a salted exposed himself to even rent\nHere is George Stephanopoulos in Nineteen Ninety two bowling reporter to tell a story about an affair that Bill Clinton was having during the elections\nAgain can if you did it in other words you know heck yeah\nMaybe one day that it will be nice for\nPeople will say nobody over ... ... again I mean\nThat they'll tell you\nWho don't do it because he's a temporary home for law and you have a campaign that I'm going to have little time and do something like [noise] um\nAnd you know that's important I think that anything they can't do anything like that but you know he did the right thing and they didn't\nI did hunting and stuff\nGeorge Stephanopoulos working for Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton\nWent on Matt Lauer show to say that the women should be investigated Matt Lauer was now accused of assaulting so many women one of whom and turned over share and was in the middle of her when she wanted\nAnd needed medical attention that's who's reporting on these stories ... ... uh putting together that and and that that's just the scene and then NBC and CBS Charlie Rose doing the same thing coming up a little suspicious\nAnd we know a little suspicious of the way the narrative is unfolding we're being told from in Washington only four percent of their time is spent getting a cabin outside of the story only ... percent\nJust say hash tag men are trash [laughter] is it really yeah or ... hate man yeah these ... these are very common it's true at every level it's from the activists level it's true in the media it's run academia it's for politics and it's true and the government\nYou have all of these examples so I think the most\nBlatant one comes from the media came out from the Washington Post ... fairly recently from Susanna the Newtown Walters a professor of sociology and director of women's gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University uh she had a piece out that asked why can't we ate men\n[laughter] I mean headline not why not\n... by the way just in case you want to blame the editor of that piece and say was a just a leading headline she writes in the article what we have every right to hate you you've done is wrong hashtags because patriarchy is long past time to play hard fourteen feminism and to win\nNot just the Washington Post the New York times recently hired Sarah Jong or to their editorial board Sarah Jong I Can't read ah everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family program that she did say white men or bowl\nOr she said oh man it's sick\nHow much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men about those are some of the more polite things that she said about men goes on and on and on there was a there was an outcry from reasonable people mean to say conservatives\nTo say are you really going to let this woman on your board they said absolutely and then Twitter which is now censoring hate speech gave her a little check mark because she is now I'm a big important\nPerson you know and whenever you accused him of this whenever you actually hold this stuff up to them they always say well it's not often that is just ... here in Athens there but that to me\nIs like a mobster saying we're not all hidden it only we only have one or two hit men but you know they control everybody you know they have these people and you know denounce them well one of them you're with them\nThat's right and you say it's not all feminists it's just the public ones\nAnd we just didn't want to I Would even say it's just\nTheir leaders but it's not even just their leaders if leaders of feminist in all of these areas so the one excuse or there's a magazine I probably can't even say this on the air or a female dog magazine and a and they said that all of these things ... it's just for formative miss Sandra but\nUh uh well it is certainly being performed but then you look at people like that Hawaii senator uh Mazie Hirono who says men need to shut up it's time for them to shut their mouths and do something good for a change you know other than creating civilization\nOther than that but [laughter] other than forming our policy I mean\n... what do you think she will pay any price but that was an an electorate that I assume it's half now\nI yeah I think her poll numbers will go up because her her base I mean why is quite far to the left and so her base or these feminist men and women and these you know there there were sixteen hundred ... ...\nAnd women and the you know there there were sixteen hundred men\nWho took out an ad in the New York times full page ad just said that they believe all women and they're the good ones there you know they're not the bad guys and but it goes it's all over the place even the ones who say we're just getting a Huffington Post at a piece on this\nUh what women mean when we say that men are trash is a quote it can actually be directly translated into masculinity is in transition and it's not moving F ing fast enough and this is what they're really talking about this is where academia is coming in this is where these\nA senator senator run was coming in is they're saying no no it's not it's not all of masculinity it's toxic masculine\nOh it really does raise stocks English so the CDC\nHas a study to toxic masculinity and ah but what they what they define it as\nIt comes from hedge demonic masculinity this is a gender theory which is that a ... has your Monica masculinity\nFrom orange W Connell formerly Robert Conley is a transgender guy who is now a and he's now a academic and he says that it's the oppressive characteristics of masculinity boys and men must assuming perform to be considered a real man\nWould like to say what defending the country and run out fires and things like\nThat going out taking care of your family I don't know I'm ... and so that's what they're getting it and they and then as a result of all this academia all of his activism we're getting these bogus statistics the CDC is saying that in America one in five women is raped\n... if that were they I mean I ... or they might be studying downtown ... almost your dog or a or Chicago but according\nTo the national crime victimization survey\nThat the actual number is an order of magnitude less at the most so you've got in a in a culture where you've got it worth permeated by live lives by the media lives by politicians lives by academia or you're going to get a culture that says men are trash the trouble is the reality just doesn't match up\nIn those hold that thought just a second this radio show is just one small corner of Ben Shapiro

is just not there\nThe reality is just not there but it does create a pretty ugly politics when I mean this is a you know this is a tension that goes back to the ancient Greeks if it were and getting a sort of\nLife's a straw to situation there were the b._b._c. random interview with a few mothers and the question was why his feminism affected the mother son bond a mother was interview she said she was furious\nBecause she gave her her little boy gender neutral toys you know dolls to play with or this or that\nBut he gravitated toward that traditionally male toys guns and army men and that sort of thing and she's furious over this what is she to do\n... I mean it than a million studies about this and kids do this without any training whatsoever yeah\nOf course they do and I got to tell you your your Prager videos coming out of the right time because last year feminism was the Merriam Webster\nWord of the year this is the end ah unsurprisingly so but I Can't imagine that this can go on forever there's got to be a turning point here because what they're doing is is they're creating this uh this sense of panic based on lies and and slander and they're in this case obviously destroying a good man's reputation and Brett Kavanaugh\nHow long can that persist before people of good faith and reasonable people and a half of half of the global population those men say a week if we can no longer tolerate this this is a vicious this violence is based on lies\nYou know it's funny I had a friend who had two boys and they wouldn't let them play with guns so the voice took a piece of wonder bread bit out the center made it into a gun and shot each other Michel ... from the Michael ... thanks so much for coming on\nA great job and I will be listening to your show later on ... ah you know one of the things I've noticed about young men I work a round a lot of people who are much younger than I Am and I've noticed that when we talk about women as which is what men talk about him and talk a lot about one\nThat we say the same thing we notice that women have the same traits we can see them with our eyes and experience and in life but the younger men are angry about\nYounger man angry about the trace of women and older men tend to talk about the trace of women with great affection so if you say that women for example women are more emotional than that and that is true and then are more emotional and then\nMost of us older guys kind of find that charming and delight phones and it's kind of softens our lives to have a woman in our life softens our lives a little bit because it reminds us that emotions do play a part in life and we should pay attention to the\nYounger guys feel somehow cheated by this and of course it only took me a while to figure out the reason is the younger guys\nHad not been told nobody told them everybody told them men and women are the same any difference you've seen societal induced okay\nAnd so that they're angry when it begins shaded they've been lied to the same is true of women that used to be that women told their daughters watch out for them they have a very very powerful sex drive they lose their heads they do stupid stuff there's sometimes cruel some of them are bad guys you have to really pay attention to this\nYou know and once you knew that you understood that when you were dealing with a good man when you were dealing with the men who didn't behave that way you were dealing with somebody who had a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand that women were in fact other people you know and I think that is very hard it's very hard for young men when they are awash\nIn testosterone to get that through their heads and it's very hard not to for them not to think like target you know there's a park target females or get female that's what that's everything in their bodies tell him to do that\nSo girls were warned and they were told and then they learned that men most men most men are pretty good you know most men are pretty decent especially when they're sober most men are pretty decent and they they learn to respect that as well and they learn to respect them as power and they learn to respect his restraint\nIf you lie about what people are", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "01"}
