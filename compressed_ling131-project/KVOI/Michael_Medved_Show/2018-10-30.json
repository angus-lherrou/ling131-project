of people can deal with this is the Jewish community and the community or\nWhat what ... what do you think the ah the president should\nIf you think the ah the president should or should say uh well when he lands and what should he avoids saying\nWell I mean I think he should know gift and doctors and talk about ah anti Semitism and what a terrible thing it is\nAnd I I mean those are the kinds of

they're starting to make it uh I I just they should not do it when Abraham I in my column I talked about Abraham going into uh the city of ... and trying to find a pen writes a man and good man\nWell he wasn't going to like a ... to find\nPeople he was going for the worst place on earth to try and find good people and so I mean\nGenerally speaking I I think that um you certainly have to respect the office and hopefully he'll be wherever he goes I mean he'll be treated that way not just a pocket one way or the other I think it's awesome it's unfortunate and I think it's better to be better\nAt it is and and again ... out of respect for the losses that the families feel I uh I just read a that apparently the sixty six year old physician I I forget his name\nJerry yeah he who who

for Jared\nA memorial rare and and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something in in some of the little time we have left ... one of the things that struck me about your column you referenced\nThe portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregation was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam\nAnd a very great ran by the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe Feinstein asked a question about what and he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people these citizens of Saddam why is the bargaining and there'll be have\nTo try to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people\nAnd the answer that he gives the says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself it's easy to love people who share your values it's easy to people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your hard for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something I read was rabbi fact I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the author doing knowledge it in ourselves and you said it right I mean I think it all up mankind it's very hard to love your neighbor especially with union my neighbor I'm just\nKidding [laughter] ah listen it what what would you have to contribute to all of this is is so profoundly important and\nAnd again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh the example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals\nUh today and ... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and ah maybe maybe in merit of the departed um ... we can\nPolling or in Missouri in Florida\nThe elections for US Senate or tied I mean literally tied\nAnd any little push one way or another could make a real difference and I think

relationship between rhetoric and violence but we begin today with the president of the United states make them kind of a shocking announcement he says he wants to push for an executive order that would outlaw birthright citizenship\nAnd the president of the United states has now said in an interview that he is interested in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrant children so here in the way the law currently operate if you come to the United states for virtually any purpose I must or a foreign diplomats\nYou come to the United states and you have a baby in the United states that maybe it's automatically a citizen of the United states entitled to All right and privileges conferred upon all citizens of the United states the reason that this is a controversial issue is because nothing in the constitution actually said that this is the case not only does nothing in the constitution actually said that this is the case\nThere's pretty good evidence that the framers of the fourteenth amendment\nHad no intent to do anything remotely like this just that just because you come to the United states and then you have a baby hear your baby is now in the United states citizen and this does have some pretty significant cost involved right now you have in California and many stories about that you've had situations where\nLegitimate birth tourism is happening people are traveling to the United states just to have babies in the United states that their kids become American citizens and there's some pretty significant impacts the center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration\nThey estimate between three hundred and four hundred thousand children are orange we legal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birth in the United states is twenty legal immigrant mother all of those children are considered by the executive branch US government the U.S citizens enjoying the same rights\nAnd privilege as as the children of us citizens the population of U.S born children with illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two point three million into thousand three to four million in two thousand eight and that's not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older the Asheville figure is actually somewhat larger\nAll of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizens there's a lot of talk about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact on the American economy\nBecause of legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example their children however are not and this does lead you chain migration because children are now us citizens and they can sponsor their parents for United States citizenship the center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they take greater effort to barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduced cost because the kids are still American citizens\nNationwide forty percent of the illegal alien hotheaded household receiving some type of welfare in some states the rate is higher in New York forty nine percent receive welfare and California forty eight percent only Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizen make use of a major welfare program in other words\nIllegal alien who have American citizen children are taking advantage welfare and exorbitant rate and states offer additional welfare benefits as well this is all according to the central Immigration Studies again the LA county supervisor asked to make that illegal immigration\nAnd my and my brother in law that he was born in the United states to legal resident parents and therefore he's an American citizen fine this was not due to the question we legal immigrant children was not educated all the way until Nineteen eighty two

Supreme Court\nThis case basically was about whether the state of Texas could deny educational benefit to children of illegal immigrants so kids were born in the United states they were the children of illegal immigrants and the question was do they actually have to be given free public education at the cost of the state\nAnd it passed and said no the Supreme Court said yeah that's because there's a left it left the Supreme Court there's no evidence that this is really accurate or this is a good ruling\nJustice William Brennan a very leftist judge wrote in the foot no nope plausible distinction with respect to fourteenth amendment jurisdiction can be drawn between resident alien says and France the United states was lawful and resident alien who's entry was awful\nWell that obviously is bull crap okay we make distinctions along those lines all the time all the time we are constantly making legal distinction between resident alien ... retina daily entertainer unlawfully\nLike for example if you're a resident alien you can ... can deport you enter America law if you're a resident alien you came here ... we cannot afford you under American law at least not without some sort of violation\nSo this is simply a nonsense opinion now just because it's nonsense opinion does not mean that it does not have some sort of legal standing a duck\nAnd the fact is that there is legal standing or or ... versus do what that means that when President Trump said that he can simply issue an executive order and overall that Supreme Court ruling or overrule the federal laws that have taken that has taken precedence\nI in in order to ensure the quote unquote rights of of children of illegal immigrants that not correct\nAnd accurate Congress might be able to do it maybe not in any case it was going to go to the Supreme Court and that's really what this is all about President Trump\nWas going to sign an executive order and then it's going to be litigated all the way to the top of the Supreme Court at which point the Supreme Court will would rule and all this now is from really going to do all of us\nGoing out and when I see folks on the left are very very upset about from talking bad executive order this way I don't like executive orders this way either I don't think this is what the executive branch should be doing the executive branch does not have the power nor does it have the capacity to rewrite laws or rewrite the constitution I felt that way about rock Obama\nRewriting laws simply suggest she was not going to prosecute illegal immigrants and I don't like it when President Trump says he can rewrite the laws with regard to birthright citizenship from the office of the president the president is not a king executive branch is not a monarchy what is this really about what is that the truth that the president\nIf he wants to pursue something like that he does have a Republican Congress could push Congress for a while\nHe does have Republican Senate you could push the Senate for a lot\nThis is really about joining up today in advancing the twenty eighth election and its high into what President Trump\nKey argument has always been with regard to immigration on our way back twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen which is that we are far too nice about illegal immigration in this country now there are a lot of folks or suggesting that his rhetoric with regard to the Caribbean is over the top\nIn some ways it's accurate and if somebody says I Want to be is there is I Can't you about the president and his credit when it comes to his treatment of its migrant carbon\nThe migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt\nI mean there's just no question about what it it it it's being promulgated and pushed\nBy Central American Latin American government being pushed\nBy the government of Mexico which is allowing migrants hair of empty travel toward the United states more when the president says these are not hopes are eligible for asylum is basically correct asylum is where people\nAre being targeted by government is not for economic migrants who simply want to cross over into the United states in order to take advantage of the economic benefit of living in a rich and powerful country that that it didn't invasion it's not an invasion when you walk up to a point venture a NASCAR silo\nI don't think that the big problem with that is that somebody is going to go and shoot up a congressional baseball game\nIdaho Bernie Sanders responsible for that I think the problem with these sort of radical polarized rhetoric kind of inflamed rhetoric the problem with that sort of thing is that when something terrible does happen\nWhen somebody does something that is true we eat when somebody goes and shoot the synagogue for example instead of a unifying and saying all of that as bad we are now more likely to see the other side as responsible for a crime that we all agree is evil\nThe social fabric relies on looking at each other as though we are friends not enemies but if our policy is all about how we are enemies and when something bad happens to be first reaction is to blame it on your enemy and when that happens in social fabric actually the case that the biggest problem that I see here\nYou know when casts honesty you write the piece for Bloomberg today and what you said that Trump's hateful speech raises the risk of violence\nIt the the one sided focus on President Trump's speech as opposed to less speech is counterproductive if we want to say let's all take it down it's like I'll take it down a notch this I agree with but if you want to say that Trump is uniquely responsible for the tone in center of American political debate right now\nThat's just not accurate it's just not accurate and you know it's not accurate I mean legitimize Italy and the last twenty four hours or Republican Party headquarters and blues your county in Florida the the windows were shot out here footage from that\nJust walked in the coming through the back door and they sell the windows and\nDid not have time at that point to look around\nAnd then um I didn't realize there was gunfire but there's more bullet holes in our windows and therefore bullet holes in the room\nOkay so the idea that violent rhetoric is only happening on one side it's just a lot there's another problem which suggested that rhetoric is is deeply connected to violence and that is you compulsion to censorship\nSo there is a threat in saying that rhetoric is directly connected with violence here is a threat the threat is that people will then say okay let's restrict the rhetoric is restrict the rhetoric and that's the move is being made in for example Europe it's being made 'em right now I'm I'm broadcasting from Vancouver it's a move is being made in Canada\nIn Europe and there's the case has been wildly under Under Cover in Europe there was an amazing amazing case in which a woman was fine for criticizing the prophet Muhammad\nMade this is this is the the description of the case from the Atlantic red would write a few years ago I appeared on alive Egyptian television show hosted by a conservative Muslim jihad of sympathies you learned early on by offering to answer any question I had about Islam including he said what is the president whether the prophet Muhammad was a child molester\nHost seemed awfully open

speech either leads to violence is violence there are consequences on the other side of this question it's not all about\nRhetoric and violence are connected there or take down the rhetoric there is a problem with the rhetoric and violence are connected and therefore we must restrict the rhetoric must be very careful about what it is that we are calling for here\nWe have to be very careful because we're not careful than the impact that is going to be a lot worse than the actual disease itself\nOkay in just a second I Want to talk about anti Semitism about the media's radical rhetoric we didn't get to all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your underwear due to fall is here and you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade or restock their drawers with all this fall colors in France\nFrom Tommy John I mean these are the best underwear in the business Tommy John obsesses over every little detail on stage\nThese proprietary fabrics to perform like nothing about the war before as a result ... men's and women's underwear sport in ... guarantee what helped me in high school comfortable stay put waistband and a ranger fabrics that are luxurious we stopped by the white moisture wedding ... what do you not against that means no bunch and you know riding up\nTommy county so confidence in their underwear and if you don't love your first air get full refund with their bacterial everywhere or it's free guarantee\nSo what do you have to lose that includes their new life changing women's underwear which is now fully back and stuff\nBefore you spend another time on cheap heat trapping multi past underwear remember there's no better way to take care of your good Tommy John no just needed hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now you've probably heard Ben for twenty percent off your first or as prominent carbon or twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com I\nLove these underwear you will do and again there's no risk because they've got that that period a level where it's free guarantee Tommy John dot com\nI Want to talk about the polarization and I'm One of the reasons that lying about the level of of rancor on the other side whitewashing yourself to a bad idea\nI have to get rid of all I have a kid who's boy and a half to get his to now the four and a half year old is just a wonderful beautiful girl she definitely has a herself the two and a half year old has now decided he's had enough and so he's going to harass her every waking minute\nOf every single day and we as parents have to decide exactly how we're going to treat that now the easy response is it when he pushes her and she screens in his face which is basically every hour or two in our house right now\nDo I simply punish him or punish are also\nThe answer is what I Do is I said to him you need to go in her crib right now right you get a time out you know what was your sister and I said her Leah when you have a problem I Need you to come and talk to me about it I Need you to I Need you to actually talk men standing right here you don't need disagreement is based there is no authority figure for which you can appeal\nAnd screaming and his base or pushing him back is not the proper solution to this but I'm now\nIs the most magical and she is you but of course yeah of course yet right he's pushing her but that doesn't mean that you get to act like ratcheting it screaming his face and then it's pushing back and get to do any of those things right now in American politics here's how things are going people unless see themselves as my daughter\nPeople on the right to themselves my daughter everybody feels like they are being pushed by the other side and they feel like it's okay to screen back in that person's face nobody is saying yeah I'm being pushed by the other side and that's bad but also I shouldn't screaming anybody's face and push back maybe what I should do instead is appealed to the broader moral authority of the American people and not act like that\nYeah that the media have been saying for a long time President Trump needs to stop saying the pressure the enemy of the people that President Trump I got a lot of blowback yesterday tweeted out President Trump should not say that the media are the enemy of the people a lot of folks on the right to know means of fake news or the enemy of the people\nI Would buy that narrative except that President Trump has never been very clear about what constitutes the fake news now there is no I think is fake news that there are people who are quote unquote journalists who are actually just\nOpinion makers there are actual headlines that are wrong that stuff is big news but the president has been a blender button and his use of the term fake news there was a poll he doesn't like it's fake news and there's a story and he doesn't like it's fake news you've never actually been very good about objectively saying what is fake news and what is not so I'm not going to buy that exact excuse\nThe press though they know the president shouldn't say that Trump Trump's and say that the press or the enemy of the people\nThat is true also true media should not portray President Trump as the enemy of the people which they have been doing literally since the day he was elected and before they say he's a Russian agent they said that he's a traitor to the country they say that he's doing all of this for his own personal enrichment without any evidence to this point\nThey say all of these things and then they think OK well our hands are clean our hands are clean and you can see the sort of attitude you want to know what folks are angry at me on the right to one of the reasons the folks are angry at the media and the writers Jemma Costa\nGoing after Sarah Huckabee Sanders on his face\nTo face\nOf which outlandish a view of the frozen over\nBoard has the enemy of the president's going to save a fake news media or the enemy of the people who would assume there's going to say that there are some journalists of news outlets of this country or for ... for a shooting you have the\nGuts cirrhosis which outlets which journalists for the ...\nOkay and really what you should say is I mean what Trump things is huge cost right in that that's what's obviously running through Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had she stuck between a rock and a hard place because at the press secretary you don't want to start labeling people enemy of the people is white Trump shouldn't be using the phrase\nBut if you're talking about fake news right I mean I think Jim Acosta is is not a good journalist I think just as objectively speaking as I can be I think Jim Acosta loves him him Acosta he sees himself as an activist more than a journalist and it's obvious to everyone CNN then tweeted out\nOr in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders who said that the that um ... media she said you guys are polarizing debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and by\nCNN communication that no press secretary in and did not say Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bumps into our office by his argument and and build and support we did say that he and you should understand words matter every single one of them but so far you don't seem to get that cats ally in and has been saying\nFor a week for a week that Trump should be taken responsibility for the money\nI mean I read you the ... like last week\nFor a full segment and CNN and hosts people like Julie ... is this radical
