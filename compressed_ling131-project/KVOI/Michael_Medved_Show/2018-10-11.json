this was not just the president and party worried about in approaching blue wave and trying to take political advantage of a moment to decorate it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome and it's consumed modern American conservatism\nBox has called at the unleashing of white male backlash\nThis is very bad by the way white males are not

then they get angry\nAlso shows that they are published so just like every other major left his argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow women accusing the white man of assault worked addict and instead the white man was a victim well to be accurate the actual accusation is that the women accusing the white man of assaulting have any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nIn some people's eyes as long as he was the

narrative at the ... in a partially from is it black folks in the United states are more likely to support political correctness but three quarters of blacks still opposed political correctness\nSo it turns out the vast majority of Americans in every racial category are annoyed by the woke crowd and they're insistence and nobody ever be offended\nSo Charles Blow says hey which is that we are allowed to racially polarized so long as we are targeting one political group that is not popular that's not popular eighty three percent of responding to make less than fifty grand just like political correctness\nEighty three percent responded to make less than fifty grand just like political correctness just Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred rent or skeptical about it\nIf that means that the rich or you get the more you like political correctness so it's not poor people pushing political correctness and say minorities pushing political correctness is disproportionately rich white people pushing political correctness\nIt's amazing\nNow there is a political gap here among conservatives Ninety seven percent believe political correctness is a problem\nAmong traditional liberal sixty one percent you the only ones who really really really like the ... culture are progressive accidents only thirty percent the political correctness has a problem yeah far far outside of the mainstream so who's in this group according to the Atlantic I loved it\nCompared with the rest of the polling sample progressive accidents are much more likely to be rich highly educated and white they're nearly twice as likely as the average make more than a hundred grand a year they're nearly three times as likely to have a post grad degree and well twelve percent of the overall sample in the study is African American only three percent of progressive activists are\nIts rich white kids rich white kids those are the people who are creating a lot of the problems in our society right now with\nOur talk of divisive polarization and political correctness\nIn one second I'm to explain what the study means by political correctness that sort of important we have to define our terms or get to that in just one second but first let's talk about your online security with all the recent news about online security breaches kind of hard not to worry about

they mean by political correctness\nAccording to the landing extended interviews and focus groups participants made clear they were concerned about their day to day ability to express themselves they worry that a lack of familiarity with the topic or an sinking word choice could lead to serious social sanctions for them so they're not really sure what it means but they know that they don't like the feeling of restriction woke left his created\nBut there's plenty of support for the idea that Americans are not as neatly divided by age or race as a commonly believed according to a few only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal nearly half of Latinos argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive Muslims are treated to invite black folks say that an immigration outages bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political ads with certain extent is just not true and there is no shrinking white majority that is going to inevitably leads a liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority that is going to lead to incredible victory over time\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we are individuals they are not just members of groups that's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left has some serious problems even going forward\nNow that doesn't mean that the right can do things to alienate them the right obviously can do things to alienate folk and I would say there's a difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is where the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that is offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk if you use the N word that's not you being politically incorrect and did you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different that is politically incorrect and you're not being a jerk when I Would recommend is that if you actually wants to side with the middle of America that is tired of the standards that are being prevented by the left\nBe polite be civil and be politically incorrect say things that are factual specifically because they're factual and not merely to offend believe me you don't have to purposely offend the lap the left will be offended anyway none of it matters\nIs what will always be offended I just spoke at USC last week and it was fascinating as a young black woman who got up to ask a question and she said you've been accused of inciting violence and I said well you've been here the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not the reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me that is why well it turns out that most Americans would rather have disagreement than a few violence to somebody who's not involved in violent and when the left equate speech and violence and then says it their own violence his speech\nAll they're doing is alienating the vast majority of the American people left is now playing against the Democratic party is playing a game speech of the right they say is violence because right when they're so bad\nAnd their own violence is speech so in the left goes in towns on the doors of the Supreme Court and ask threatening that just a form of speech that just anger according to CNN but if folks on the right say stuff that offends people that's now form of violence\nOn CNN headline news when I Am and as a man and woman is a woman and some\nTransgender woman grits me by the back of the neck and threatens me bottle bodily harm those two things are equivalent me saying man as a man and woman is a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing me physically on national television and threatening to send me home and in an ambulance which is literally what happened the left\nIs engaged in in this really polarizing him and most Americans don't fight and that's what we found out in the Trump them in in the Trump era most Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that Trump's gonna win from here to eternity it doesn't mean that Republicans always when Republicans are not good at this game there now\nAnd again when you mistake politically correctness for being a jerk or vice versa you're making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that this notion on the left at the woke majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true statistically and that's a very very important thing to keep in mind we still have more in common than than not\nAnd you can be fooled by watching our politics are washing social media I get a little too\nBut it's not reality I mean speaking of folks were not living in reality there is a leaked report from Google was leaked to Breitbart and it's just an amazing report the Breitbart reports and internal company breathing produced by Google and leaked exclusively to Breitbart News argues the variety of factors including the election of President Trump the\nAmerican tradition of free speech on the Internet is no longer viable this goes for exactly what I'm saying folks on the left have decided that if their speech they don't like is equivalent to violence and does it must be shut down", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "11"}
