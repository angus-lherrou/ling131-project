O. stance for marketing optimization so Web\nHyphen mode dot com you can get them it's six to three Ninety nine eight seven tell them that you heard about him on Tucson business advantage Dan Ward and was given them a little shout out and uh and I'm sure they're going to treat you write one of the first things that they do if you have an existing website\nIs they run an analysis on your kind of your competitive space so they find out who your best competitors are in Tucson who showing up\nNear the top how much traffic they're probably getting how many searches are done each month locally on terms related to your business so again that landscaping business is probably a lot of different search terms that people use some of them you even as the landscape professional may not have thought of\nBut those are used and so ... was able to do an analysis and say okay who's showing up when these searches are done and what what are the primary searches are being conducted\nA in your particular industry and that that ... says a lot of our informs how you need to design your Web site and also how you need to design any ads that you run on line\nAnd ah also ah which you know it kind of the key words that you want to have appear at a on your index page okay so what ...\nBrian Lawson Web hyphen mode dot com six to three nine nine eight seven as I said a a different take a different approach really a different uh business type that they serve\nFrom the J three effect which is a Johnny why it's company\nNow we had a a a a fellow on the air here I don't know a couple of months ago his name is Carl Schultz and coral has a company here in Tucson called card solutions incorporated\nA card solutions ink\nAnd ah you know there's ... basically what he does is he handles credit card processing there's a lot of people uh that do that a lot of ah agents in town\nThat uh you know represent different merchants services companies and and just to put it really nicely\nAbate the the industry it does not have a good reputation\nThey what they what they managed to do to merchants is get them into long term contracts get them to sign leases that they didn't use the terms of which they didn't understand on the equipment to process these credit cards and then when they've got 'em all locked in that uh introductory rate\nWears out the the rates go up but the the merchant is locked in Carl shoals\nActually has done all kinds of things he's a retired military man he was a a a chief financial officer I Believe for gates Learjet here in Tucson and credible analytical background in business background\nOr when gates I'm not sure the\nWherever they are moving to in coal reconsidered decided to stay here and and I became an entrepreneur going from working from a from a big international global company sophisticated company to starting his own business\nUh carts solutions incorporated carts solutions Inc or you can find these guys on the line as well at card solutions ink and C.\nDot com and he decided just to apply all the expertise that he had ... had acquired along the way at one point\nHe will he went back as the CFO and started analyzing these credit processing statements that he was getting from his merchant services company and as a CFO Carl told me that it took months for him to figure out what was actually going on\nHow uh you know who was getting paid who ... who the intermediaries were how much their charges were which ones were negotiable which ones were fixed and how could he improve\nThe cost of processing these credit cards now if if you're you know if you process one here and one there ah you know it's important to you but it's probably not a big deal but if you're in the restaurant business or any other business it's processing\nTens hundreds of credit card transactions every single day and all different times of the day uh with all different amounts\nThen this becomes a really significant thing for your business to optimize because the money that you lose here is just right off the bottom line any money that you can recapture stays on the bottom line could be the difference between you running a profitable business in between ... and in from you being actually run out of business\nSo carts solutions ain't Carl ... is really really impressed with his expertise\nWith his integrity with his commitment to giving local businesses a fair deal\nA now how you know how many times if you if you own a business and you've dealt with merchants services\nAre usually you're there they brag to you about this great eight hundred number they give you and the response time that goes with this eight hundred number but your experience is it yeah you get a really rapid response but it's a lousy response Carl gives you a local phone number\nAnd he's got a I don't know how many tax here but they're all local they're all experts he gives you a number that doesn't require an area code to dial it you'd call and guess who answers most of the time it's car\nSo you call the guy who's gonna fix the problem is the guy who takes your call he doesn't pass the buck doesn't matter what the problem is he's going to track it down and fix it if you're a merchant and you've had any kind of negative experience with credit card processing and most of us have\nOkay so I'm In Tucson I'm thinking\nThere are about thirty five I looked at this I don't know six months ago about thirty five thousand businesses\nBusiness entities in Tucson that have twenty five or fewer employees\nAnd there are roughly thirty thousand of those who have have a Fifteen or fewer employees if you if you had Fifteen employees the chance of you having a CFO of fulltime CFO would be approximately zero right\nYou usually have announced that keep us\nYeah you've got a book keeper a in a bookkeeper obviously very important job that they do but they they generally don't bring much strategic expertise to the end for interpretation of your books right\nThere they say tasked with entering transactional data maybe printing checks or reconciling a bank account that's really what the bookkeeper it's tough to do and can do really well\nOkay so so ... people had and they may have an accounting kinda department and their business that's a mostly manned by or a woman to buy a bookkeeping person not necessarily an accounting for the bookkeeper can be very proficient at it\nBut they're they're tasked with a you know the same sorts of things day in and day out\nThen you've got the owner of a business who probably has a background some technical background and whatever that business does\nThey don't have financial expertise a Middle East rarely do they where where do ... how did these people get by financially how how do they come up with their plans are what are they do\nI Do some of them are really lucky and some don't make it on the other really lucky was\nReally a great at producing whatever it is whether it's a service or a product and they do it really well and they spent all their time making the money on that and they they keep their overhead low\nBut there comes a point where they're going to grow so quickly or they need more and you know I'm not again I don't know if we're talking about Fifteen employee business\nYeah let's let's keep it in that so ten to Fifteen or you know at\nThat point I mean we've got P. S. T. laws that are kicking and we've got 'em\nGrow grow senior business that's kicking and things that are going to trigger\nWell maybe I Need another vehicle in my fleet um but then you go to the bank and they ask for financial statements to see whether you can get a loan and you've got that had in the deal I have given the headlights a kind of look on your face so\nWe kind of jumping make sure that all the financial information that you need to run your business\nIs always up to date and make sense and puts you in a position of um whether it's your tax physician or a loan to fish in I'm In a positive light\nAll right so eastern business consulting you said your rebranding to what\nHe does to you\nCFOs to U. T. O. Y. O. U. but number two why oh OK CFOs to use all that out pretty good okay so um [noise] let's talk about the balance sheet\nOkay All right and you've got a well we've just described employees say ten to Fifteen employees got a bookkeeper doing things if you if you go in there you know let's say it's been a business that\nYou know they've been around for five or ten years they've got that book keeper the bookkeepers preparing documents that they give to a tax preparer they get their taxes every year they're they're doing their best to kind of play by the rules\nWhen you in a in a scenario like that when you look at their balance sheet for the first time what what's generally how do you feel about it\nWell I I can I can cited an example just from this week alone actually I went into a business that has about Fifteen employees um they've been in business six years\nAnd the bookkeeper which started with than six years ago really you know it's fine to do again these transactional data entry printing checks paying bills that type of thing but really didn't understand have a strong I'm understanding of accounting\nUm or taxes\nSo fast forward now six years and they're finding that they don't\nTheir their um balance sheet and their profit and loss is really not up to speed as told by their ... their CPA and their bank\nSo they brought me in to take a look and I took a look at the balance sheet and none of the numbers made sense and when I questioned the bookkeeper she she um said that it's really above her head and she doesn't understand what the balance sheet even as nor did the business owner\nOr [laughter] you know what to do that I Do teach a class to anybody and everybody in a lot of business owners really don't know how to read a financial statement and I can teach them super plain English how to read the balance she had\nA rate of profit and loss so that as a business owner you know early on if maybe something's off or you can question something and we can jump in there and and and fix it right away because again it's really cost effective to have a bookkeeper at that level of business\nUm but you need one that can grow with you or be get somebody like us in there to make sure we can get it to the next level\nOr how how do people access this class that you're talking about\nThey can just give me a ring at five to zero nine eight nine Ninety nine thirty or a finds me on the Internet at east and business nc dot com and just sent me an email either way I'll be happy to find them up for the class\nGreat Ninety nine nine nine three zero let's talk about ... you know most business owners like talk to him a business broker or by the way folks in Tucson with Tucson business investments that's what I Do for a living and that's why I'm so interested in in a local businesses but uh most of the business owners\nTo do it yourself bookkeeper types\nOr they've got a profit and loss statements that they that they run they produce and it's it's not altogether accurate the revenue numbers usually pretty decent on it but but in terms of a balance sheet\nThey they almost never have one there and when they do have one they go yeah you can rely on that thing at all I you know I wouldn't trust anything that it says there except maybe Canada you know cash on hand\nBut what what is the most important part of a balance sheet or what's the most you know the primary purpose of a balance sheet and how does it help a business owner how could it help one\nWell the balance sheet really shows the whole health of your business from the time you started your accounting to the day that you're looking at the balance sheet so that's probably one of the most important parts of the financial\nData or or financial statements that you can have a two run your business the cash on hand is super important to keep up to date and hopefully when you're reconciling your bank account you're looking at past\nPrior year items that are still living in there um but we tire out the whole balance sheet I Can't say that there's any one part of the balance sheet that's more important the either the key word here being ballot so they're all important or you won't be in balance\nUm you know your assets are it's important to keep your assets up you know a lot of people are able to get 'em to appreciate and take that depreciation credit on their tax returns so unless your assets\nAre actually on your balance sheet you don't have that opportunity I'm equally if you have loans out and you're not booking your interest expense separate from your liability another thing that you're going to want to\nKeep up to date on your balance sheets protects purpose reasons and then lastly toward the bottom of the um balance sheet is your retained earnings which is a a term that a lot of people use and and don't know really what it is\nUm but you retained earnings is really the history of what your profit and loss has been year over a year\nAnd for example if you in the air one made ten thousand dollars a year to last five thousand that retain earnings number will now be five thousand dollars and I know that just by looking at it at a glance if you're in business two years and you only make five thousand dollars we have some work to do\nOkay and let's let's take that example you've got a five thousand dollars of retain earnings over over a two year period we've got work to do uh what what would I mean typically what would some of that work consistent where would you start\nOn the map of\nLoss okay would I Would take a look at that and see where some of the holes are maybe we need to put some budget center into place or do some forecasting a cash flow analysis\nBut I Would definitely be I can tell you there's two places that money is spent that is harder to control and people tend to not want to look at it really it's the ticket sold and payroll those two numbers are going to be your highest expense it so that's where you start looking\nOkay so cost of goods sold you you buy you've got suppliers who sell you\nStuff and and they sell it to you at a cost 'em and you know how I I don't understand why people would be reluctant to do something I mean there's not that much you can do about it is there\nThat you care about and that's why you want to go local you're also talking to a person that's going to turn right around and spend their money here in our local community unlike out of town\nBig shops from somewhere else where the profits wind up spending getting spent on the east coast or the west coast or\nSome place

seven nine zero point forty\nTucson walking back to the created the show where I Am joined in the studio today with colon and Erin from\nFirst look social and you just heard that number seven nine zero two zero four zero if you have a question you'd like to ask\nAbout social media now is the time to do it we've got some amazing professionals in experts in the studio or who would love to take your questions your comments are your thoughts on social media but they're not here forever so jump on that phone and make the call the lines open\nA for years so uh I I'll I'll give it to anybody to either of you guys in the inside of me who wants to answer this first but I'm a ... with how important story telling his for communities for ... for causes for Iran's for people\nOr what do you do as a company like what is the thing that makes you guys special unique and effective\nWith how we teach kinds how to use storytelling yeah and your philosophy on social media yeah absolutely so you know it really comes down to authentic content content you create if you're not creating your own content and you're just sourcing it around the Web um\nEveryone else is doing that right you need to be creative that's what ... is all about which is which is really the pot from we work with the ... that came on the greatest city show ... okay [laughter]\nBut you know I'm just through the data that we provide our clients right you will see spikes in authentic content and if they're sourcing content that goes way down I'm so we're able to provide that real time data to our time to be like look this is why this works you can see it you could see the instant feedback\nSo what we can do is help you know content consult with them and help help them get creative and their own business with learning about their business you know learning who their brand personality is and being able to help them tight together okay oh this is how I can create more content 'cause I think a lot of people have that content block where they're like\nMan I'm a plumber like you said and I don't know how ... who's going to be interested in this town and I'm so we help people be able to think outside the box um to capture that original content that will actually tell their brand story\nRight I mean that's an that's an amazing segue uh because I decide close the last segment is I think there are some industries where this feels like a very natural fit\nAnd there's others like I Would imagine like maybe again someone or is you know runs they plumbing business or construction related business or or something that maybe isn't doesn't seem as information heavy and they're listening and they're saying\nIf you're asking you know you're telling me the value of green authentic contact I have no idea if we even have anything to do with my business so I'm In ... that are there examples of companies that you worked with what that spectrum of companies have come to you and said help me out my social media game\nYeah so you know [laughter]\nI'm Out of Cleveland, Ohio we work with them down yes a commercial um heating and air conditioning company okay to be to be happy to see which people you know to business to business business to business a lot of people don't think that social can really be beneficial for that so what we were\nAround Seventy five hundred now we've been working with them for about a year and a half\nUm they get some great engagement you know two hundred three hundred likes per photo they're getting fifteenth comments and it's really 'cause we're helping them target you know people that are in the trades and yeah they're loving this work you know they but we've helped them treat is not just you know I'm\nPictures of just air conditioning units but pictures of all this cool piping and you know a children's museum that they're working in and like all this super cool content that um the contractor see but no one else ever get to do um and\nNow that you need to get to see that a contractor working all these devices that they go to every day a\nStory telling stories that ugly act with exactly so um\nThe cool thing about what happened with them is that they could never ranked number one on Google it was some company in New Jersey with a ride and learning that out ranked them\nUm I think it was after him it must have been three to five months in that area um they're ranked number one on Google right all just because of the ... coming from Instagram and people looking at going there and help move 'em up amazing some feedback\nThat we got from the owner was the ... he's like I never would've expected to have new employees reaching out to my company and in this day and age we're trying to find employees such a hard thing to do she said it helped him saw one of his biggest problem right\nRight because employees are are saying I I resonate with\nThis company I like what they stand for especially since so many kind of a younger employees want to be a part of an organization or company or a cause that they believe in in terms of values and what they stand for and I think when a company can tell that story\nAside for me to be or business to consume or just even just employees by in\nThis huge um that that's an that's an amazing point I'm Glad we went there because I think it's huge\nI think it just shows too that the company isn't afraid to be open minded and and they're not set in their ways they're they're they're cool with becoming creative you know stepping outside the box to try something new and I think that's what we saw with all those people reaching out to the direct message saying hey you know what is the employment like here um\nAnd so ah the owner beyond what did you do to get content from your company he goes well actually open ended up to the employees I made it a competition where whatever employee gave us the best content we'd flip them you know twenty or fifty bucks a week and so the employees were inspired to\nShow pictures of the pride that they were producing out in the field the quality work and it and it really study it helped elevate the company\nRight yeah and I've heard that about companies who just blog\nAnd um you know uh do like a kitchen trick you know things three things that a homeowner needs to know about their age back unit that they don't I mean that's that stuff that creates amazing relationship\nUm one one of the uh one of the themes that I've been hearing a lot lately um is that one of the things that has held Tucson as a community back\nUm is a lack of quality storytelling that we've got some really good teams that are starting to brew here um but that we don't tell the stories effectively enough to create a brand and\nI'm a ... relationship as a community and as businesses and companies and organizations within the community uh what uh what do you see as missing or in this market for businesses and companies as far as\nUm some of the services that that you believe you bring to the table and and how is that giving you an interest in the passion for the city\nYou know obviously I'm not native to Tucson to be honest I wouldn't really have\nThat image in mind that you guys wouldn't be good storytellers 'cause you know it's such an artsy place in Tucson and that's one of the reasons why I Love it so I I maybe don't even I don't I don't see it that there's a story telling problem but maybe it's just a reach problem maybe we're just not reaching enough people write\nAnd essentially that's what we held businesses with we help them reach more people and then we take that data and we say okay this is what you can do to tailor your content your storytelling so we can reach more people\nYeah I mean essentially at a thirty thousand foot view we're helping you connect and make those connections inside of your community were leveraging one of the greatest algorithms for networking ever created yep\nUm as um you know\nLocal here in Tucson I'm are probably where we live in a town even and she's on my shot if I'd like we have areas of town where certain types of people like here in other areas\nThat are for another person right I'm In a lot of people don't realize that that was all really by design I'm up in jail if I'm like twenty inch in the late sixties they were all of these policies that allow certain neighborhoods developed in certain ways\nAnd allow certain people into neighborhoods and cut them out of others and so the Housing Act which really pass\nTo stop that type of activity right you in illegal housing segregation and kind of district and racism that we saw in our housing market that I made it so that\nI'm starting to apple here and she was on um the split hill generally I'm chilling today are hum the people that live in up hills are while he liked people generally speaking right and not again was by design so\nUm but their Housing Act was put in place to deal with that kind of sit in a segregation um that I ended up in kind of really racially ethnically I'm I'm\nKinda pockets in different cities right we are very segregated around along racial and ethnic lines um entered the economic aligned across the United states right in their Housing Act with me to kind of stopped that\nRight and so um how how would you say scenes are in general uh fifty years of fifty years and will determine into Tuesday on your end but uh yeah fifty years and it didn't work the way it was supposed to or are we seeing progress or\nYeah yeah I Would say that there's definitely been some um some victories share um it it's been on the books like we've been saying for years and it wasn't really until Nineteen eighty eight that it was being enforced in a meaningful way the law\nOn an eighty eight has been a lot of really great victory right um but the issue with the fair housing act at this point um and this was going to change under the Obama administration you things are happening in the housing\nAnd but right now the way the fair housing works is individual come\nTo organizations like my my my organization stock Lester housing council um NA um tell us that they feel like they were ... I just kept a nation that we go to the commission and housing and we go to the court than we file a lawsuit and we get a victory for that one individual\nRight and so I think it's a lot of really great victory on that individual level\nRight and but in terms of the demand\nRight and we still eat a lot of segregation in the housing market um we see this in terms of their\nKind of knew lost it they're coming out that are dealing with looking at foreclosures right the houses that have been foreclosed upon and instead they look like you look at properties that have been foreclosed upon and make it a Phoenix and Tucson are part of this study they found that\nProbably closer to ... upon and kids of color have been really under maintained by the banks that have the title for this property right which we know we know kind of how the housing market for it right if you're if you had\nAnd they get home and homes that are being left and get your hair that's not good for that made it brings property values down it also attracts\nUm kind of unwanted activity in those communities and so things have aids has been ugly not been taking care of the types of property right and we need the color but in any kind of the white\nMore affluent areas of town stayed thin making sure that the property stay really put together um that type of activity is definitely still happening at a systems level right we still are seen mortgages being given out to people of color at higher interest rates\nThan their white counterparts heavy vaccine profile is eight and so in a lot of ways there's been great victory but that's just stands right and in equities newly purchased at that kind of more macro level um and like I was saying I'm going to mention that was\nReally significant movement to deal with that\nMackerel level systemic racism that we see in our housing market um right now since since um the new administration has taken over in Carson is the head of head right and that's really been rolled back and a lot of ways so I'm I'm Still a long ways to go\nGotcha and and rage and we're going to get hosts a scene in on this uh in a second but I'm Rachel kind of a started to answer a question uh that I had\nRachel kind of a starting to answer a question uh that I had I think the term there is a term in lots of cities around um around the country calling underfunded are areas where there isn't enough banks are not enough money or or cash flow in certain areas of\nOf cities uh the the issue of housing is what drove Martin Luther king junior I mean these are really well documented or challenges that community safe up really come back\nUm comeback to housing or why should\nWe all listening care\nUm besides the obvious I mean there's there's there's the obvious desire for adjust and healthy healthy community but I'm always curious you know if we're talking to a business owner if we're talking to a bank or if we're talking to you know someone who maybe live more north\nI'm In the city what what why should all of us kind of come around the table and care about\nThe state of housing and our communities do you want to take a stab at that and then I'd love to jump to host is you know in terms of how to sons doing\nYeah um I think I'm\nI'm fairly new to this show to myself and um I guess what I Would say um\nAnd then I can kind of think about you know it's better it's everybody in the community and it ain't it successful right but um I think what I have found that really interesting and all these studies have really I'm given as evidence and proof of this right is that housing matter\nWhere you are situated in a city really had significant\nImpacts on where you end up in life right I've never been study after study done by the rabbit would I get on nation right by so many different evidence steak umm ... foundation stick and creating duties big studies that show that like where your code\nYour that couldn't believe the trend we end up in life\nUm and so when we think about housing you know it doesn't sound it's not really ... like you know what a law you know if you live in a state is great but what\nPlease give you the ... in a certain place it leads you to everything it wouldn't shoot education at least you chew 'em people in the community it means you to certain ... and all of that that where you end up in life\nIs really determined by where you are located and I think um we don't\nWe don't stressed out and not ... it doesn't really matter where you are I'm Still and for those people that are leading a really great neighborhood um you know you um\nYou would hope that we would care\nAbout the neighborhoods where people don't have those opportunities and kind of sharing and making it so that we had like needed more equitable um because at this point in time um most of our big cities here in\nIn Arizona not including Tucson I guess really stratified and not equitable at all and so certain people's had opportunities and they're able to really ... and get to where they want to go and then we have a whole swath of the community that are left out of that completely and it starts way where these people um as typically located\nYeah I'm the editor I Would say\nYeah no that's good I mean there's there's an obvious justice component but there's also an economic health component and so I think whoever\nIs listening or engage on this topic and will provide a tangible next step for anyone interested in this topic further uh in the next segment but there is a reason I think any and all of us regardless of where we live or what our background is here in Tucson we should be understood on\nThis topic before we go to the break um what was the scene and I've had a chance to work on some housing issues I'm specifically on the west side and also seen as a ton of experience\nI'm In the community uh how how is um has Tucson doing on the issue was the scene of housing and fair housing how do you see this plane out uh in the barrios in on the west side and the city in general\nWill as ... as we're hearing M\nMs Rachel there is still a lot of great need any here in Tucson and we've heard of the past airs that we have made in downtown Tucson and with the conversation of downtown neighborhoods coming together\nWhich include dental and west\nTheir chemical about a conversation about the development downtown and yes it's good\nOr city is is an economic development force but there needs to be a balance because we could also see how much homeless in in the street and how much are our families are struggling with two or three jobs at a time and we might say well why should we care but we never know\nWhat can happen in that in that there's wheel of light we don't know how it'll affect our lives and then we need to care that\nBecause I like to go back to the African saying that says it takes a whole village to raise that child mhm and we will all we've had a child around that may be a grandchild may be a child up our own a neighbor's someone that we care so if it\nDiverse and strong team of how our city is going to be I'm developing and try to avoid those gentrification thing you know that it's not only gentrification of building but a cultural\nThing because it's very farm community we need to be harsh it or maybe they were\nAll of the calls were coming into I could not agree with how your IndyMac

district pencils talk about I once sent back to the house of representatives what ... what motivates you to go back\nWell John thanks for having me again it's always good to be on your show um\nI I Want to go back and finish up some things that didn't get completed this last go around I I was fortunate I forgot to say that my first term as a freshman I got six bills passed and signed by the governor a which is a far more productive than than this happened in district and formerly district thirty sometimes in the past\nAnd ah I also a co sponsor thirty three more bills that were signed into law which benefit at Tucson southern Arizona in the in the county so I mean just to go back because there's a few things that just didn't quite make it through and\nI Want to hit them again and and all related to education public safety public health and of course the economy so I got I still got work to do\nWell let's talk about ... what do you want to do too well and brokered because obviously the challenger in grapefruit thrown vegetation is struggling in Arizona that\nAbsolutely it is John uh one of the things I Want to do is try and find sustainable funding all the way across the board including the capital improvements with the buildings and facilities themselves air conditioning or interior improvements whatnot and then teachers paying is the sustained uh we ... I did vote for teachers pay\nIncreases although I did have some concern about sustainability\nBut I think there is some evidence we can look at in including one of them that was a a brought up actually by senator Farley several times and that was basically just review\nThe tax credits that we offer in Arizona and whether it's a corporate tax credits or individual tax credits based on donations to charities or schools or what have you um I that needs to be reviewed and uh I think that's important than in it doesn't say change it just says reviewed but we don't seem to get\nIt past that point in and unfortunately because it's so partisanship\nI think that senator Farley didn't have the advantage of having it at least heard and committee and being a Republican in part of the majority in the city or the majority of Congress rather I may have that opportunity to at least present it and say let's take a look and see what's working what doesn't work\nUh that's one avenue I I also want to kind of review maybe some of the lottery funding because I don't think people really understand how the lottery\nTrickles down and and ultimately are eventually get education and why maybe a little bit more of it doesn't get\nIt there I'm just just review again there is no definite a change but at least get it in front of a committee\nIt's testimony on it and redo a what's been going on so we can we can make the best choice is is that you know as as times change\nBudget shift change your own personal budget when you set a budget for your household you look at it every few months or so yeah we need to modify we need to band we need to move money around her quit spending in one area and add more into another and and I think that's just one of the things we really need to do for education so we can\nWe can get after it and make it work also I think we need to level the playing field with a charter schools and public schools and I've I've always been a big advocate for public schools and a tech schools in fact I'm going to go to an event tonight for Jay Ted they're having their annual gala to do some fundraising\nI'll be down there that promoting again uh education for getting skills and trains developed for our students are but at the same time again as I was saying we need to really evaluate\nThe playing field between public education and charter schools or with accountability and funding and finance and all that stuff I like school choice tremendously but again I'm a big supporter of public schools and I just think we need to look at that those are some of the things I wanted for education\nTunnel I Will be talking with David Wells with the Grand Canyon and screwdriver shortly our in our in our ... our they've done a remarkable job of tracking from very larger of funding for\nThose super in terms of the CEOs of charter schools all across the state of Arizona is you know we're\nProbably have more charter schools any other state we were kind of the leading edge charter schools in front on across the United states there are there has to be some oversight for charter schools are just have to be really quick that ought to be a tub\nRight I agree with John and and I know that a Cape broken the gay senator Kate broken e as as a promised him pledge to kind of lead the charge and and I've already contacted her and told her that\nAs a matter of fact in in the next year we're going to see your property taxes go down the highway tax rate has gone down so this is just an excellent way\nTo address I heard you say that there were Seventy percent of our roads and he may county that are poor and failing condition and that is absolutely correct It's money would be able to fix one hundred percent of the failing route and at a very large portion of the family as well as a court that ... excuse me no\nPrima donnas during the sport but I Believe a part of the four hundred and thirty million or an equitable ... a a among I guess area jurisdictions I I I Believe I saw this is going to work the disbursement of ...\nI think the calculation based on an assessment valuation and the roadways and the poor conditions within each jurisdiction received the power to a treatment that that's how this worked right\nThat is correct you're exactly right every jurisdiction and Pina county actually allocating funds and that is based on population and in that style and we found and and he does go fiction basically are in control and saying okay these are the worst roads in our area\nAnd those yelling roads will get sick the first and in that regard less if you\nLive in Tucson city limits if you let it outside and in in ... in unincorporated Pima County and this is really\nA John and in my opinion our last shot I mean we've had we've had many things that have sort of gone through the ballot for his language is so specific that it has to be ...\nFor neighborhood and major roadways in our county and the and there's really no one way anyone can get around that there are groups who are going to be monitoring not a\nGovernment groups as well as local ...\nNobody's senator property tax levels don't need to be I don't think I could be wrong but I don't think they need to encourage them to simply be I guess you'd call it the main trained\nTo cover the cost of the roadway reconstruction program in fact I think the board of supervisors or voted to decrease the primary property tax rates by thirty nine cents for one hundred dollars ... that's the largest single\nA year decreasing so I don't know the seventies but I'm not Muslims that\nThese ... that it absolutely correct so people are actually going to see how that you're going to see your entire property tax statements that costs the back of down which is pretty amazing\nWork we have to do this I just I mean we're we're counting the spread from ... come and gone\nI just I mean we're we're county the spread from her going gone I mean it's a huge amount of the area or in many diverse communities but structural away from all the way back to them around and to the north west\nAh and and throughout the south shore return on drugs I mean we just have to have an infrastructure of ... is up not only save a but also going to accommodate the growth that as a parking place every single day this has to be done and it was going to improve your doctors\nAnd seems like the ... has put together a mechanism for the money will be spent responsibly with the ... gonna be the highest priority which would we obviously much to address\nThe Bush this was something we need to do I've I've always wondered why people don't know what I'm going to do this because we don't want to do this it's a more money for government well I'm not going to go out and for for them roads tomorrow I'm just not going to do it I'm busy tomorrow and I'm not going to do that sort of have somebody else do that\nAnd that's what this county's has to do right\nThat's absolutely right and the longer we wait to fix the roads the more expensive it's going to be in worse shape we're going to be I mean let's face it some of these roads were going to be back in almost like a a the carriage days you know buggies going around because it really does so much damage so it does economic\nUh it it it hurts our economic impact here you know we recently had\nThe national site selection committee that helps businesses come in and find out okay where's the best location to bring our big operations in and do you go down to one single thing they said\nThat we can control and do to help companies coming out with the fix the roads I personally know of a very very large company they all would know who came here\nWho almost had the papers sign they part of their business was in transportation and at the last minute pulled out and said that the reason because our roads are in such bad shape\nWhile at some of the effort by where\nYour oldest ones will be separately accounted for both the bond and then the transportation\nAdvisory committee or ... I Believe that are going to monitor the expenditures report those expenditures ... so there's gotta be some accounting and it'll be on to the public the ... going to be honest I Believe would probably mean uniform transparent reporting system explain that if you will criminal\nYeah so the regional transportation authority is in charge of monitoring these fun as well as a citizen based group to over an oversight committee a and so in order for any jurisdiction\nTo make a change there are three huge steps that would be nearly impossible for them to ever make a change to how these things are you not to mention the last step of convincing all about the supervisors to allow them to do so I I there's many many blocks along the way\nUh to prevent any changes from that are happening and you know we talk about again reasons why we should do this\nYou know let's talk about public safety for a second I mean when you have an emergency and you're waiting for a police or an ambulance it decreases the time that their response time\nWhich can save lives it it's it's horrible on our cars it costs the average citizen and Pima County about five hundred dollars extra in\nCar maintenance and you know you talk about getting kids safe safely to school in a school bus whether or not wearing seatbelts and hitting these powerful I mean we could go on all day long and this is the reason why I think we have no choice but to pass\nAnd vote yes or proposition for sixty three\nWell sort of a very uh ... the creation of dollars that only in unincorporated a prima county which is of course outside the boundaries of metropolitan Tucson a but also within the boundaries of the city were roads will be improved with this money obviously\nIf you live in the city you live in the county and you're voting for this and you weren't there obviously improvements in your neighborhood where what is needed and just because we're able to live within the city does not mean that you will be excluded\nFrom the repairs will explain how that works from one boundary do another crystal\nYes so each jurisdiction is going to get their share of money hasn't talked about you know we are we have anticipated and looked at the map that actually shows\nFailing rose and poor roads and this will cover about fourteen hundred miles of reconstruction and about half of that\nIs probably in unincorporated areas of Pima County over seven hundred miles and unincorporated Kane county and about seven hundred mile with in the city limits so it's going to be spread and Barry fairly and in a way\nThat and just because you live in a nice neighborhood doesn't mean that is where the money's going it's ... you might live in a nice night nice neighborhood and have a failing road and they don't do that\nBut it is very equitable in saying these are the failing road\nThey have been rated and its they're failing those will be fixed first\nRun you know I'm not sure there's a serious are organized opposition to this I Know people on the left and right but I noticed ... which is a progressive of bloggers had a huge would approve of proposition for sixty three I Believe the weekly support for the\nYou know from a left him from the road or the both sides of the political spectrum in Tucson realize\nWe've got to do something or if you were ... or two thousand two hundred miles of ... roads were just happened to 'em and that's just the way of ... that's just the way it comes down in in this opportunity to get it done now\nOf like I said I don't see opposition to the left abroad and maybe you do I don't but I think on both sides of it the birth premature consensus this has to be done\nThat's right and and this is a beautiful thing in our time of chaotic politics [noise] ah we have people on every side of the aisle saying that this has to happen we have support and I can spend our entire time telling you you know from places like the southern\nArizona community foundation to sail to the Tucson that's a ... valley chamber of commerce I mean all across the board and ah you know you put together a little fun commercial and I think it's my favorite thing I can see because I don't know about you but I turn on TV and I see all these negative political ads\nAnd then all of a sudden here you have\nJim click a Republican and former Congressman Ron barber a Democrat standing together pleading for people to fix the roads so I don't think this is all a political issue I think it's just a common sense", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "13"}
