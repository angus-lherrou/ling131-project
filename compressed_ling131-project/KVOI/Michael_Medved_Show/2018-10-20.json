cover Pima County and even a little\nBeyond huh yes in the county and Leon yeah\nInteresting All right so a garage doors are a lot like air conditioning hey let's say I'm a got a quiz for your Raymond how what is it to the garage door a toilet and an air conditioner have in common\nYou know then I got a question for you right quick is this great it on the curve\nThis this is you either get this writer you get it wrong if you get it right you get an AA as in a a synthetic and if you don't we just move on okay okay\nWell I Would say we all use them at least once a day\nMaybe that's a great answer unfortunately it's wrong well have you got to figure that the answers they only break at the wrong time oh they only break after hours or on the weekend\nYep that's why we run twenty four seven dance\nHugo twenty four seven because you know the what I'm saying is true now if you call the have your toilet repaired after hours or on the weekend it's going to cost you quite a bit more than it does during normal hours\nSame with your air conditioner so\nIs that true on your garage door service if I get trapped in my garage and I call you at three AM Saturday morning\nHow much has been going to cost me extra\nSaturday morning how much is going to cost me extra\nThe same as it would Monday afternoon at two PM really\nTwenty four seven a single rate no matter when somebody because nobody wakes up at ... nobody says hey my garage door broke at two pm on Monday afternoon but I'm going to where I'm going to set my alarm for three am Tuesday Morning and call Raymond just the torture [laughter]\nDoes anybody do that oh no no no\nI Hope I haven't given anybody him right idea\n... well you know we get a lot of calls at\n... for pm five PM when people are getting off of work yeah we do a lot of that and in the early evenings to Dan you know we're there to help them when they need help\nIs that usually what happens is I mean is it fifty fifty that they go out in the morning to try to leave and the thing one open or it does it happen more often that when they get home at won't open\nUm it's it's about fifty fifty you know it it sure that you bring or motor can go out at any time so it's about fifty fifty people go out in the morning ready to go to church or to a appointment\nOr there'll be coming home in the afternoon from an appointment or whatever is there a motor won't work or their remote won't work spring the garage door is not going up maybe maybe the guys who are the six inches and it'll just drop back down\nSet up right there [laughter] All right what's what's up with these springs ... when do they were out what causes them to wear out just usage or whether or what\nYes um you know use each other's heights I revolution strings can be up to a fifty thousand cycles you know you can open your door fifty thousand times or while I'm you know with and that's\nYou know or or they can just be regular springs and they can you know run ten to twenty thousand cycles\nHigh uses so is that is on the high usage thing is that a ... relatively new development\nWell um yes\nIt's a seminar and more and more you know\nWith the springs and stuff for we got our revolution springs so it's it's so\nIn the last five years they've developed is yes\nI'll hire revolution spraying once you just said was something like fifty thousand cycles versus ten thousand cycles is that literally five times the cycle life\nAt there's lay claim that's what they are so okay and\nAre are they five times as expensive\nYou know we've got one price and that's what they are so\nReally they're they're they're basically the same price as the low cycle\nHe just drips of integrity and you can really pick that up in the last a little section there of our conversation where he said that when they\nAre when people call and they've got a problem with their garage door uh they kind of taken through a few things over the phone the most common things that go wrong rather than making a service call and discovering that you've got a bad battery in the remote or that you've got an alley de light in your opener that's interfering with the signal\nThey'll figure it out over the phone and save you the service call and hopefully you'll returned the favor the next time you really have a garage door issue and your call them for so Raymond recent a authentic garage door service great great talking to him as always appreciate him a spending some time on Saturday after a big week with us\nWell we had a you know one of the hot topics now I guess everybody knows is and it's not like this is the brand new hot topic but it continues to be one is a digital marketing\nAnd that's the funny thing because we're talking on the radio here and radio and digital marketers are a sort of competitors of each other a radio guys like to say bad things about digital marketers and digital markers never have anything good to say about radio why is that because of\nDigital marketing part of the situation is with digital marketing you can measure a lot of things that go on you know if you put a radio ad out there are TV ad or they can kind of the station can generally tell you how many people were probably listening or how many people were watching but they were\nListening to the radio and watching the TV but were they paying any attention to what you are saying or what you were showing them you don't exactly know that\nWith digital marketing uh you you do know and so you can track whether or not somebody has actually come to your website now if they if they go out of their way to come there you can assume that they at least looked at something and you should know that\nAh so digital marketing according to Bryan Lawson over Web ... is a lot more of a science than it is an art art is certainly important but if you think about\nHow most people look at a website or what they do on Facebook most of their concentration is spent on how the thing looks\nAnd ah of course that is not unimportant but more important than that is what people do when they get their why they come there and how and how fast how quickly they can find what they were looking when they get there because time is now of the essence\nSo Brian I don't think Brian would ever use this tagline that the one that I got after talking to him was that do do is everywhere producing do do when it comes to digital marketing but you gotta watch out\nTalk about the science of it the mathematics of it before you talk about the art of it if you're building a website or doing anything on line where you're trying to generate some business\nOne of the favorite guys I talk to hear a on this show Tucson business advantage and by the way if you want to see more about our gas the ones that are not\nOnly that we are talking to today but the ones that we've talked to in the past\nAnd and now at this point a late September last weekend of September ... so far\nIn the last ten months we actually started in December but over the last ten months I Believe we have spoken to a hundred and thirty two hundred and fifty unique local business owners the show is all about small local business\nAnd we've talked to more than a hundred and thirty of them\nAre in a lot of those interviews a lot of the pointers that they gave us a insider insights that they have things that they've learned through experience and hard knocks a lot of those are sort of chronicled\nOn our Facebook page Tucson business advantage\nYou go online look at Tucson business advantage you'll see our Facebook page and uh you can see some of these folks and read more about um I think you'll find it interesting but one of the one of the most interesting guys that I talked to a and again a unique business model is Frank sane\nOr his company is called just water heaters\nAnd obviously you can find that you go on line just water heaters Tucson you're going to see Frank's company\nAnd ah I Love the simplicity of of the value proposition which is Frank does nothing but water heaters just water heaters and he does nothing but residential water heaters out what that means as he does more of them far\nMore of them than anybody else in Tucson he does them fast rate does them for less money and he does them with no surprises or if you go to his website just water heaters website and look at that thing he's got\nFull price disclosure he's got technical descriptions of the the water heater that is probably in your home to the water heater that's in just about every home in Tucson the variety of water heaters the pros and cons of them things to look out for a you know quick things to do if you've got a problem with\nYours and if you do have a problem you can call just water heaters\nA day or night seven days a week and there's a really good chance that you're going to wind up talking to Frank the owner these guys have a phenomenal reputation if you look at um on line in terms of reviews\nVery very happy customers just another stellar local business doing something that that no national company can or even tries to do doing it for less money and ah and pouring that money right back into our local economy So Frank saying just water hears\nA I I recommend him if you've got any sort of an issue related to water here\nHe is he is to go to guy here in Tucson\n... another guy that we talk to you and you know he's got to be a pretty happy that this season as winding down that's Ron arenas that picture rocks cooling heating and plumbing those guys just go crazy beginning in may I mean they're working six or seven\nA week and however many hours a day it takes\nA so by the time they reach you know late September here\nUh they they're just trying to crawl across the finish line fantastic company\nAh you know same thing with Ron you you make a phone call the picture rocks cooling and heating ah you're probably going to talk to Iran the owner if you've got somebody coming out to your house he's going to make sure that the job is done right if he's not the one that's actually doing the job itself a tip he ...\nIt was done right if he's not the one that's actually doing the job himself a tip he gave us is that if you want to extend the life of your air conditioning and your furnace\nHamper I'm a regularly scheduled a time in probably every two or three months to change out your air filter so you know just do it right it on your calendar\nBooted up there every uh two or three months to change your air filter don't even bother to look at it and see if it needs to be changed just assume that it doesn't change it\nAnd according to run if you do that a first of all you're going to get better performance on on those pieces of equipment and also you're going to get performance of last longer they're not going to have to work as hard you're going to save a little bit of money\nYou'll save save me really nasty repair bill at some point or at least for that so ah change those air filters out\nUh I talked to a lady who performs a really cool service here in town has a company that delivers that service her name is Cindy show or a with caring senior service of northeast Tucson\nOr if you've noticed going around town there are some enormous a senior living a complex is that are going up communities uh uh for folks because you know we've got an aging population\nAnd a lot of folks are transitioning now from homes that they've occupied for a long time into communities uh you know in almost a an apartment like\nA property that has various\nPhases of senior care available you know starting with somebody who is completely independent\nUh but wants to be in a place where some meals are easily accessible where social activities are available and uh you know some uh exercise and and personal care like like hair and\nYou know just a lot of things that are ... advantageous to being in a community many many seniors are starting to move in there and then uh some of these uh same uh facilities offer escalated care as well like assisted living all the way up the skilled nursing so these communities are incredibly popular but transitioning\nFrom your home of twenty thirty forty fifty years is emotionally a very challenging experience Cindy show her with carrying service of northeast Tucson\nSpecializes in helping people navigate through that situation making the best decision\nGiven their unique situation and ah so I highly recommend that you talked to send you show her caring service of northeast Tucson even if you're just beginning to

people in our community\nTo be able to have access to license kitchen space has to be able to understand how the food system in food community really does work and that we really are an amazing family

I got your first name right there yeah that's correct on science Diane\nWonderful the name of your talk and we are here because we're just a couple hours out from the text Tucson salon\nA vent food for thought and we're looking at a food systems and the future of food or in our region and uh I I think you're a great selection for speaker for this event because you are going to talk about\nEating like a Martian or you're an analog astronaut geo scientist with a passion for space exploration I have so many questions and I'll bet our listeners due to start with an analog astronaut what is an analog astronaut\nAn analog astronaut is somebody who engages in human spaceflight research and training but never leaves the earth and get to live in Morris simulations are moon simulations or you go to facilities where you gauge in training similar to what an astronaut we'd get\nIncredible and they and you're a geo scientist on top of that that is correct so I teach geology and sustainability classes at a community college in Phoenix, Arizona\nOkay wonderful I how I've never heard the job description analog astronaut what's the twenty second story on how you got into that well\nYou know it started um I was a finalist for the NASA astronaut program back in two thousand and nine and then a couple of years after that they were opening up a new analog site on the big island of Hawaii and this was the NASA\nAnd NASA was funding it specifically to look or investigate food strategies for long duration spaceflight and so a friend knowing my history with NASA and my desire to be an astronaut sent me the link and said I should apply and I ended up getting selected and living in this new analog site for four months\nAnd he's urging food yeah it was really great experience and what's been great is that in the last pretty much ten years you've seen a lot of new analog sites pop up around the world this past summer I spent two weeks living in a mood simulation in ... Poland incredible write\nOut a ... and I I Love the four months you spent wasn't a place called high seas that's correct that's happening on earth and or maybe a little irony that it's called the high seas and yet your research and what you're proposing is that will be more sustainable we remove the water that is correct mood is\nSo much water you know what what what what are you pitching\nWell you know I'm looking at it from the standpoint and I learned a lot of this to my analog astronaut um experiences that\nSolving for space also earth and when you thinking about food and food deficiencies and especially with the habitat on the moon or Mars you've got to have this food supply lines and ... to do that the food needs to be light weight\nAnd so freeze drying takes that water out so that you can ship it and then add that water back at the source and then I was thinking about how we ship fresh food around the world all the time and what we're really shipping is nutrients in the water\nSo if we can take the water out and leave the water at the local source and just ship the nutrients you know you think of a place like the southwest desert where we are in Tucson and how important water is for us here\nAnd so when it comes to sustainability this whole idea of what is fresh if it comes from halfway around the world is it really fresh is it worth all of the um energy and all the things that happened with food\nOr do we or should we consider fresh to be local\nFrom food or regionally grown food and then things that are going to be shipped internationally or imported be freeze dried and think about your freezer how much food do you have and you're freezing that could instead of being in the freezer be shelf stable because it's freeze dried\nThat's interesting so if you connected that to your Ted Talk or tonight with a sneak peak of how you're going\nTed Talk tonight with a sneak peak of how you're going to have bring this all down to a few minutes talk what do you want in the audience to take away but what's what's kind of basic structure of your\nBook I think the the the you know the big ... points are freeze dried foods are now available in your local supermarket you can find them as freeze dried food some herbs and some vegetables but the whole idea is can we can we request more can we get it so that instead of\nHaving large refrigerators and large freezer that every single household in America that maybe we become a little more sustainable by creatively cooking with a combination of\nFresh fruits and vegetables that are locally sourced and combining that with freeze dried fruits and vegetables from around the world and\nYou didn't like a Martian yes eat like a Martian\nSo how would this then translate to space or we've talked about some of the earth side implications um but but why is this valuable in space\nWill of the thing is that we're going to build a habitat on the moon or Mars then we're gonna have to have a food supply line to keep those Martian astronaut happy and healthy right and so the food that we're going to be sending them needs to be shelf stable and light because the ... when it comes to space\nIt's all about the weight of getting things out of earth's orbit\nBecause when we first established these colonies or habitats\nThey're not going to be you know they were going to have it will take time for them to grow their own food and the type of food that they will have will be to some extent be limited so there's going to be this\nSupply line to the habitat that we create in space and eventually it'll be cool because the food that they will grow on the moon or Mars will eventually be coming back to earth and we'll have this kind of relationship of\nFeeding Martian food or lunar food and then us sending our food up to that [noise]\nWhat's the I I didn't plan to ask this question but what's the timeline to this actually have a more you see it well I see it going\nTo see it in my lifetime okay I I really hope that we you know there's a big push now to go to the moon first I think that's um where I Would want to go is the moon\nAnd I'm hoping you know within the next Fifteen Years that we're realists realistically not only back on the moon but starting to build a an actual habitat there and\nThat thing that that would be incredible so here in Tucson we have the biosphere new now is this similar or is that is that a way that maybe we can think of some of your work with high seas and kind of an enclosed analog space absolutely\nAnd I think that that's an excellent example of an analog site where people came in our living together and they did and that was a really interesting simulation because it was completely closed system\nAnd a lot of analogs that are popping up around the world aren't as close because of looking at things like fruit cohesion where it's okay if it's not a closed system but eventually that's where we need to we need to study is how can we\nCreate closed ecosystems that could survive and thrive on the moon or Mars with humans in there and what would that food look like what could you have or ... grow on the moon\nOr on Mars and then what would they what would we be supplementing back and forth between each other\nAnd incredible thought this is why they called big ideas moon shot or you uh do you play it you know upon too much on what we're talking about but these big massive ideas where you hear them and you go\nHad so much bigger than anything I've ever thought of before but these are real questions that again during your lifetime we might have to ask an answer\nAbsolutely and you know one of the big things is food waste and food spoiling around the world\nAnd so how can we reduce some of that would freeze drying the food which makes it shelf stable\nUm for a while would that be one of the things that would help with that and so these are the kinds of things as a scientist I like to think about and it being able to live in analog simulations helps me combined that love of space and space exploration but\nReally thinking about real problems here on earth\nAnd I love I Love what you said there and trying to remember what we solve in space applies yep\nIf we what we are solving for say solving for space solves for earth\nI Love that I'm going to pull that out I mean that's that's incredible oh well as a doctor said Proctor thank you for spending a few minutes with us here on the air or this text Tucson a vet food for thought as a part of\nA an even bigger event going on called the ten

you want to represent you in that district it certainly doesn't represent our district well\nI mean he struggled to explain what he has done in sixteen years and the one piece of legislation or the money that he talked about for the American idol sudden get order them tree was money that was a rock largely as as the\nWorkings of Janet Napolitano and and Senator McCain and and some of the other legislators he he had hardly anything to do with that\nSo you're suggesting that after all these years a little accomplishment from William trumpet\nWell he's um obstructed a lot of things and uh\nI like that how he well what does the obstructed go ahead\nWell and maybe that wasn't the right where you really hasn't done anything for the district\nAnd like I said you have trouble explaining what he had actually done for the district you look at the district and we've talked about before on your show that um and it and I mentioned it publicly on the debates that you know I'm saddened by\n... or the conditions they see as I traveled through the district the pockets of under employment and uh and the living conditions it's it's and then you know the closed up stores and everything I mean part of it has been economical changes but a lot of it has been the attitude that that uh he brings to the office\nYou also talked about during a drought ... ethics and integrity in office to explore that a little bit further if you will\nWell in terms of ethics um\nYou know you want somebody that is going to work hard and and represent your values and work hard for you and he certainly has shown that um you know there's public the examples of of the doubt that have been in the news and and that are certainly a forty thousand dollar a settlement to a\nFrom a claim of a female staffer I mean

while you said is you know and if it is\nI'm a jethro case\nOr a life sentence we cannot get rid of anything\nNot the case work not exhibits I'm Talking about ammunition bloody clothes um whatever it was that was it that might have been used in that case in the courtroom we have to hand every single piece of that\nUntil that prisoner is deceased\nSo we have a lot of stuff down your ... your laundry anger out of things but we also do our own we have our own budget and our own human resources you know it's so I'm not a small office but it's very I'm busy very complicated a lot of things that we do\nYou were in the state Senate but I thought you were great for senator or a loser southern Arizona so well how does that help you with ... with this new job group of job I was a lot of responsibility as you as a as the buffet type of job ... how does that help you\nWell this job I'm is primarily um we have to follow a sketch it airs um statue so in order to to do that properly you really have to be able to understand the statues and the\nChanges that are made every time the legislatures in session and um all those little details so much almost everything we do hinges on statutory responsibilities [noise] you know there's of course having having been through that in the legislature is something that I I understand\nThis is a people draw too because if you need a

I think that's near as good as the pumps you hire I very rarely\nYeah and and I think that um well\nIt's no surprise that nobody wants to be in in the court house nobody wants to have to be in court\nThat's you know if you get called the court you they're not happy um and so when they come in to file a response to something or have to pay a fee for something they're not happy was happy to do that um and so a lot of times they come in there in very bad spirits\nThey're very unhappy they're very uncertain they haven't been there before most have not I don't know where to go what to do um and so they you know if they're upset thing they take it out on somebody who's had one of our windows or something and I have to tell you I Am just I could not\nBe more proud of that people um they're they're not highly paid there's you know their government workers they handle about twenty million dollars um that they collect\nUh for for the courts um and they deal with people who are in this bad
