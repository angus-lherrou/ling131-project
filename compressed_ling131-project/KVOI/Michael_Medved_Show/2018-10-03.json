is going to be bring the Bible to school day it's sponsored by focus on the family\nAnd it is the fifth year that they're doing this last year they had five hundred thousand students who participated

ministry a based in Colorado Springs Colorado I've had the great pleasure speaking for focus on many occasions\nA gym of first\nOf all and people are hearing this and a lot of people are saying is it illegal to bring the Bible to school\nAnd Michael is great to be with your absolutely not that's the thing in our culture today these religious liberties that we have had for over two hundred and forty years in this country\nThey're simply not exercised every student has the right to bring a Bible to school if they wish to read it during lunchtime and free time not during class time worth disruptive\nAnd do that and it's completely legal and in fact we provide a one sheet illegal statement for teachers and administrators who invariably come to the student on this day bring your Bible to school and they'll say hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate buy\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this a head in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious celebrities in this country anymore\nI yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left who would say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a caller on the school or or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whenever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably or this is a a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or a boy\nHas four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's\nCompletely right I mean you think of

what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot know it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this\nYou're emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people in saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell or or I I hate you unless you come

I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school opera bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians in the class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that\nYou know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew and I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lotta shaming for people of faith\nTo the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles to school

are the solution of the NAFTA problem uh remember President Trump\nOr has it in the sense of the very beginning of his campaign promise to replace NAFTA was something much much better\nAnd or against a lot of people's expectations are it appears that this has been a successful solution now including Canada not just Mexico it's a major major event and it should be good economic news for everybody\nA Stephen I'm more as a good friend of the show and a a good friend even off the show\nHe um he's also a leading a economic expert and writer and researcher for the Heritage Foundation\nAnd he has been ... for oh a couple of years now an informal economic advisor to President Trump as Steve you were at the rose garden ceremony for the conclusion of the trade deal weren't you\nI was I was there Monday morning I now that was quite a quite a performance by the president\nOr that explain why this is important why people should care about this so I don't know maybe even more than throwing ice at a a bar fight in New haven in Nineteen eighty five\nYeah this is a big deal at the big victory for Donald Trump and incidentally you're right I did work for Donald Trump with my my buddy Larry Kudlow is not over a running the show as economic trouble with the White House\nBut I used to always tell them you know Donald I Do not call Donald or the cap and of course I called Mr President I say you know I don't agree with you on that but I think not there was a pretty good thing\nA ... so you you said that this is it you know your your introduction was it looks like we haven't improve NAFTA and I think that's a good way of putting it you know a ... you know NAFTA needed to be updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with him that this was the worst trade deal ever in fact I think it was good for all three countries but\nIt it'd be come out of date there were some abusive practices that were happening by the Mexicans in the ... you have\nYour your guard down from any time to talk about the water to three hundred percent you're an American dairy products or he had a very funny line in his speech by the way the rose garden he said now those are those Canadians are going to buy our ice cream [laughter] you know which I think it's a good thing\nBut that I I watched that a good thing for the whole I'm not it's a better deal for American companies\nAnd ultimately what this does I think the bigger story yet is that you know this president who's six months ago or a year ago people worried was going to create some kind of global trade war you know is an interesting Michael but now you first she got the failed built on with Mexico\nAnd now he's got the deal about what that looks like he's going to get your thumb with European uh\nInternational have South Korea\nReact now South Korea and Japan and it's like these dominoes falling and the irony here is this quote protection as president and I was worried about this with Donald Trump said he would pursue protectionist policies or you know at the end of the day we may end up with freer trade that not that more strict\nPolicies ... with the exception of the steel terrorists which I still think what's it must be okay I\nOf this deal terrorists which I still think was it must be\nOkay I have a lot of people are saying that part of what President Trump is doing is trying to settle these less important trade dispute or the ones that are all to the low hanging fruit that he that he can settle a show that he has more leverage to get tough with China do you buy into that thinking\nTotally yeah I think that's exactly what he's doing and you know it was very interesting is that people get a chance to if you didn't see it live it was beautiful day by the way of ... and the rose garden that was already five degrees and beautiful day after I got up very spoke for about an hour and a happy talked about when I talked about the trade deal has some\nYou know back and forth with the press which was registering a ... just as an aside married say Michael that you know I've been to many press conferences over Thirty years um I I've never seen the kind of abusive treatments that the the meat you know these young punk kids they're twenty five or Thirty years old\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful the president I don't have a problem Michael or you know if someone from media asking the president of the question that's why we have to be asked president question but it's not the tough questions manners and they just rip\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay first question was what a cap and I said look\nI'll take care of our questions but we're here right now to talk of the you know the trade deals are there any questions about the trade deal and he sort of an after work I'm Talking about the trait of Antarctic question of Kevin next first resurrect or a cabinet extra what about camera or are you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's be apprised of the United states with respect and dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with with rock Obama in fact I disagree with most of the things he did every time I saw him I was always sure Mr President\nAnd it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll ... I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honestly it's like reading more and peace it goes on and on all the New York times\nUsually aren't times at our team thousand words I mean it's a lot of words basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly ah both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march thirty thousand a it was I'd read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing I had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on\nThe first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know the hundred I'm you know friends episode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times how many times of the times run the story I I ... I worked on the campaign they much one three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year another running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one that won multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper is up into this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging tax fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman than any good you know head of household will you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I Try to at least amount of actually after the most him out\nThere was a shocking tax avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of\nTax fraud when a lot of these look I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last ... years has been it by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he released his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about uh his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again your old one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN a crust Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nReleases tax forms I advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which was Thirteen they aided Thirteen thousand words they don't even you know a lot of attacks document\nI question I question both sides I Try to be fair I think but I Do not mock somebody\nOkay so again a when you say mocking ... of people have said he was imitating her voice she wasn't even find imitator voice there was no false said oh there was nothing like it when he was talking about\nWas the fact that she couldn't uh or wouldn't answer basic questions which are very real

not a joke at the end there's a reason Republicans are unified on this one and it's because this feels like a witch hunt this feels as though the Democrats are fully intent on destroying a good man simply for the sake\nOf delaying a Supreme Court nomination and the Democrats I say\nThere are certain times in American politics that are very difficult to watch\nThis is one of those times because things are so ugly and so acrimonious and some nasty right now you find yourself pollinating about it\nEven when you don't want to think about politics\nThe idea that somebody can be railroaded on one allegation with no corroborating evidence now we'll see a lot of evidence that cuts the other way\nAnd that this is supposed to finish people's lives if you're a good person you should be thinking

Shapiro show so we just read you a letter from Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend that not much holes indoor story we'll talk about what exactly does hold our one never mentioned for years anything about the sexual assault never mentioned cabinet now that doesn't necessarily undercut all of our credibility according to forge never said anything until two thousand twelve\nAuthor she testified in front of the Senate she never coach anybody with regard to a polygraph numbers made a big deal out of taking a polygraph that you still don't turn over her notes from her psychiatrist you turned over a polygraph notes on a polygraph notes racial questions of their own such as in the polygraph notes original polygraph note said before she took the polygraph\nThat she was sexually assaulted in the early eighties you crossed out early\nNobody knows why then she took the polygraph and then she passed the polygraph but she testified under oath that you did not coach anyone on a polygraph never ex boyfriend says that's not true there is her testifying about this ...\nI didn't expect it to be as long as it was going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nAnd you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never\nPay and it turns out that that is a serious question or were you lying about that the Senator Chuck Grassley has now sent a letter\nTo the attorneys for this woman for Christine Blasey Ford and he asked for material evidence relevant to the allegations he does he want some corroborating evidence because he wants to note from therapy sessions the doctor for just got and then she turned over to the Washington Post\nAnd he says he wants copies of all video or audio recordings produced during the course of the polygraph examination of Dr for what she will not turn over\nAnd then he says the full details of Dr ... polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee\nHas received a sworn statements ma longtime friend Dr Ford stating that he personally witnessed soccer for coaching a friend on polygraph examination when asked under oath and the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips or by someone who was planning on taking a polygraph soccer for replied never\nThe statement racist specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result instead of therefore need that's information\nSo she's got a credibility problem there as well\nThen shelters another credibility problem it turns out that she's gotten her Senate testimony over and over again\nThat she was in therapy into thousands well because she had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door is because she had security concerns because she was still deeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault\nAt the hands of Brett Kavanaugh will now it turns out that that's a really good story real clear investigations talk very over real their investigations has beef\nAnd when she says real estate and other records on her cut a key part of Christine Blasey Ford's accounts of why she finally came forward with charges of attempted rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years\nOr testified last week that should never revealed the details of the alleged attack until twenty twelve inches and couples therapy with her husband she said the memories percolate it up and they revisited the disagreement they'd had over her insistence on installing a second front door when they remodeled their Palo Alto California home\nAnd he took splendid decision her husband didn't understand pushed her to station one door to leave the symptoms and foster phobia and panic attacks based on the alleged assault\nShe was physically I stopped by Dianne Feinstein mind sign out is that the reason for the second front doors claustrophobia and for that correct\nBut documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an addition and has been used by rent or even a marriage counseling visit the door was not an escape route one entrance roots and attorney familiar with the ongoing congressional investigation it appears the real plan for the second front door\nTo rent out a separate room how ... how outlets any records show a building permit from the
