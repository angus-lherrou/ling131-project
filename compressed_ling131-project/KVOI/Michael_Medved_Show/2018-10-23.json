it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project\nAnd I think it's perfectly appropriate would signage around it reminding people of everything that you said\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context or this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away this three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this

before and Twenty years in federal office so this is her six federal race or election I should say\nBut um what what I think it's going to happen is that people around the country are you going to realize that this is not a deep blue state if people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and and\nBy the way and this one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seed there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nSays on there that he lately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nOr that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists\nThey don't want this new

sometimes is just wrong\nAnd for instance I I think part of the governed bowling that's just wrong has to do with trying to force people to put little boys and little girls and people of all different ages together in the same showers and same bathrooms in school\nOkay imagine this indicator Georgia there was a a case where parents were actually stripped of their right to even protest on this transgender bathroom issue listen to this one Decatur parent\nWhen you send your daughter to do you have a level of expectation that you're you're not going to be worried about you know they're not going to be you know exposing fucking that you're not aware of as a parent I learned about the transgender policy for my wife she just happened to be on the front page of the the tendons and got windows\nPolicies that there were an acting that was going to uh open bathrooms locker room sports teams\nOvernight lodging to both sexes\nOkay overnight launching right\nAh and tragically that transgender bathroom policy it already led to a five year old being sexually assaulted and our girls restroom at school and if this can happen in Decatur, Georgia it can happen in your child's school\nBut alliance defending freedom is standing with parents nationwide offering free legal help to protect their rights in other words it's terrific to have activists to have hair\nIn other words it's terrific to have activists to have parents getting involved and getting active trivia and going out and voting but you know what sometimes you need some legal defense just to get your voices heard\nAnd that's where alliance defending freedom comes in if you'd call right now\nYou give a donation to support their work providing free legal help for people battling for their religious liberty

five four three three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four three three eight eight\nOr ... this is a an incredibly bizarre\nIt seems to me the the overreaction that the stunned reaction to a president from using the word nationalist look I I Will always a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything he didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goals\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important\nWhether Kavanaugh hearing showed was that even for people who might have some doubts about president from some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw from the Democrats was just so incident we worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that are a great core of people on the Republican side said not that\nNo and we have to come together and fight it and that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ...\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes\nPretty directly with the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real crime then the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find\nMyself as an American and going back to a theater Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag\nAnd your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what am I even give your heart to is our\nNation not a race not an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that were offended by the term nationalism I\nHonestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side I think of anything helps on the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael met that show\nI I think that America is neither a country founded on nationalism nor Internet ... global\nAnd I I um I actually believe is probably going to work out well for the Republican side is that uh if all of the people who prefer to think of themselves as a pillow blessed I don't know anyone who does by the way if if somebody out there you embrace the term global is to refer to yourself\nI'd love

trying to come up with the way to combat that once you come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates a federal power of the modern era she has now discovering federalism I got amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along and suddenly Hillary Clinton and the letters covering the states are kind of great\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday in reality I mean she brings court with the right one majority is it the states are new important front in protecting civil rights especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us\nIs that really a new important front in protecting civil rights\nOr does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting so right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that states were responsible for he'll crow that's true\nIt was also states that were responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act and an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war the federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act facing the north refusing to abide by the fugitive slave states are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people comprised them\nThe one thing that is certainly true is that the United states\nThe mixed state and and national system as it is putting federal thirty nine they mix system state governments are designed to preserve the sensuality of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that the lasted only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like is the head of the federal government demonstrates just have this on if they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever gotten charge against how long do you think they picked by the state's right proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states right answer it's five second by second\nAt the left is just dishonest about all this stuff that same left they proclaimed that Donald Trump is dishonest vicious dishonest and Hillary Clinton says she likes states right\nNow what Hillary Clinton means is that she wants to use any obstacle to prevent President Trump governing which is actually believe in states rights and she actually believes in states rights and presumably should want to ... to the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president\nWe all know that that was never going to happen when I was never going to happen instead the truth as Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian country where people forget to tell you this but the policy in Scandinavian country it's not just the math and social welfare state they now in social welfare state paid for by enormous\nUnbelievably high taxes\nThe taxes in places like Denmark and Norway is sixty percent on everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year\nWe're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly would take the paper all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do is they'll just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing\nSo they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing that base legislation is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primaries and the Democrats who can spend the most cats so we have Kamala Harris is proposing getting every poor family five hundred bucks\nBased on nothing we really don't know where that money is going to come from how this is going to spur the economy any of that stuff Cory Booker says well why did five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred let's get everybody can grant\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way went up by millions helicopter pallets of cash over newer will just drop out of cash and hopefully people get out of the way not it'll be crushed by money and die happy\nThat apparently the idea of Cory Booker according to box which is the repository of all things too but that's not gonna say that everybody at boxers do but there's something intelligent folks a box of all why they were made there is beyond the senator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor is idea is to get lower income kids a sizable next day\nA creature no more real than the five class or hypocrite\nNo again you're real human but you're not a real woman\nYou know why because we're not genetically it real woman they aren't any or gender or gender and feminine and you're a male who had surgery to look more female and that you carry feminine attributes\nThat is accurate that it's accurate use of language and it's not accurate used language to say they are a female on Sunday news broke that the Trump Administration seeks to narrowly defined gender as an immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth\nWell actually they were defending facts that way and then you guys can play fetch and generous and he said the same thing\nI met him reluctance react to this latest cruelty which is obviously just one more cynical move clearly designed to stir the pot ahead of the election trans people as late as conservative whipping girl\nLike African Americans in the Nineteen fifties or gay people in the Nineteen Ninety two thousand\nNope nope\nGay people can objectively claim to be attracted to members of the same sex\nThat's a subjective claim there is no way to objectively verify that so that is what is it I can objectively verify your sex variety of measures and black people white person who claims that they're a black person is not in fact a black person is racial does all learn\nI was speaking at the ... Scott Fitzgerald festival in Rockville, Maryland this weekend when I first read about the administration's intense since then I've thought about a lot about Nick Caraway in the great Gatsby\nAnd then there's this continued instead the actual world contains all sorts of wonderful variations in extra money there to camp and puffing there's a duck they'll put up with in a blue lobster Venus flytrap isn't it a miracle that God has given up all these wonderful thing surely there's room in this world for these there should be ruined his world for me\nThere again nobody is addressing that transgender people should be mistreated but you do not get to tell the entire civilization from ... to find biological effect on the basis of anti science positions because how you feel on the inside\nMy favorite part of this piece is disgusting that science is on the side of this policy there's no science on the side of the policy promulgated by the left that sex does not exist and they started off with ... but gender is unconnected with that and then they went to gender exists but it exist on the spectrum and then once you start to exist again but it only exist on the spectrum\nExpected sex didn't exist for a while now that just again but it only exist on his back and there's a spectrum of sat there is no speck of a sex\nHuman beings are sexually ... okay if you if you want to suggest that there are other species where sex can change fine or you or not you're not a fish or not one of these ... changes that you are human among human sex does not change that's not the way this works\nBut this has been pushed by the hard way and so you get the spectacle of Steven called bear hunting from cutting President Trump on this friends issue\nAnd how telling is the remark and he's about to make it's pretty telling ultimately wind a second\nBut some of them information is thinking about writing new guidelines fixate gender should be defined quote on violence\nNew guidelines they said gender should we defined quote on a biological basis but it's clear grounded in science now you care about [noise]\nI was in the crowd sure of that now you shouldn't you be happy that they care about science\nI'm confused he doesn't when it comes to climate change that the Trump Administration is utterly anti scientific when it comes to the EPA they're only anti scientific and that's bad but now they care about science when it comes to biological sex\nAnd that's bad that's even see the poverty and what he's saying himself answer is you know because of left even scientists malleable now my position on climate change I've made clear multiple times on this program I did like an entire program on it a couple of weeks ago\nTalking about the new IPC report the world is warming it's warming at a lower rate than the scientists said it was going to according to their modeling probably a majority of that warming according to every scientist I've ever seen including why Spencer who is\nIt the right favorite climate scientists suggest that the majority of that warming is due to human action that does not dictate global governance of the climate in order to dictate that we have to crush capitalism\nIn spirit or an action\nBut that is considered an anti scientific position by the left and it's considered a and it is considered I guess that formed mentioned science when it comes to biological sex now\nIf this is a new democratic position good luck with this guy is good luck\nOkay so I'm just a second we'll talk about some other democratic positions and why the new cycle continues to cut in favor of the president of the United states first let's talk about what you do in the bathroom to get ready to go out every night\nWell I use dollar shave club because I Love the dollar shave club has everything I Need to look feelings known my best but I Love even more in the back I never have to go to a store I mean you know me I'm not a big fan of the human and that means I don't have to go outside to even get all this stuff delivered directly to me\nIt can be fully stocked and what I use I don't run out here's our dollar shave had everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for that he covered head to toe hair skin ... they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically keeping stocked up on the products that you you determine what you want when you want it shows up right at your door from once a month or once every six months\nThat's what I Do I mean are you there they're black pepper and

waiting for get your start are set for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com slash then that's dollar shave club dot com slash Ben\nHow stupid is left agenda with regard to the anti science nonsense pushed by the transgender movement is an actual tweet from New York Times science the idea that a person such as determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\nWell ... realistically speaking I suppose that's not true in the only in the most\n... most narrow sense is determined by chromosomes determined by genetics and theoretically you could have some sort of birth mal formation when you are born that leads you wrap them to genitalia match up with your actual genetic so I guess in a very narrow incentive true but the idea that that means the taxes on the spectrum among humans is just stupid\nI Love this headline anatomy does not determine gender experts say right genetic determines gender\nAnd all of his researchers who have studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeonhole typical male female pigeonholed though they are just created by society\nThat that the Trump administration's latest planted a bind gender goes beyond the limits on scientific knowledge yeah here that a person sections determined by their anatomy at birth is not true we've known that is natural for decades as John ... says Joshua Saper an endocrinologist\nAnd the executive director of the ... the center for transgender medicine and surgery of course the mount Sinai helped him in New York you don't talk about a scientific stuff\nAnd you talk about whether they're beneficial effects to transgender surgeries over time and there was not good evidence to suggest that the and the fact over the course of decades is actually significantly spirit and no surgery and yet this has become part of the transgender movement shtick now\nLet me be clear we live in a free country you want to go cover up your own I don't know if that's your problem or you can find a surgery is willing to do that for you\nDo for the free country but let's not pretend that science is on the side of all of the claims that are being made\nBy love is buried down in his article at the genetics does play a role though oh you think oh you think so in is it by the way you know how you know and it's not just going to tell you because they mail or to have his leg and berries physically removed in some sort of action and he would still be a male\nIf he intends to do so in a surge where we are not supposed to consider him a female and that is that is not logical I Want to talk for just a second about the sort of propaganda that's been promoted on on this issue and it really is insane propaganda\nSo the the notion that has pushed by the left that transgender isn't is not a mental disorder is completely a scientific\n... now what the what does that they like to say things like the diagnostic and Statistical Manual because the DSM five suggested that\nGender identity disorder is no longer a mental disorder instead what the DSM five said is it a mental disorder is it called syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental process these underlying mental functioning\nNow this is that this is the the funny part\nSocially deviant behavior in ... in conflicts that are primarily between the individual in society are not mental disorders unless the devious or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individuals described about in other words you're something it makes you think that a pink elephant is talking you almost makes you feel bad this is not actually a mental disorder according to the DSM\nThe definition makes room for it's making clear room for politically correct posturing right if I'm having a significant problem ended up myself all I have to do was blame it on society's intolerance and then there's no longer considered a mental disorder\nAnd so if you're suicidal because you're a man who believes he's a woman\nAnd yes I can still find a way to blame that on society all you have to say is the reason I'm suicidal is because people are mean to me in society not because I've suffered with this\nTerrible conflict inside my inside my brain for my entire life\nAnd now societies fall is how the DSM five avoid the obvious implication that if you're a man who believes your woman\nYou have a mental disorder it by the way if you're in that person who believes or skinny or a skinny person who believe ... we all knowledge of mental disorder\nIf you're a skinny person who is your fat it's called ... it's dangerous and it's a mental disorder if you're a person who believes that you do not need a left arm is something called body just mafia this is a mental disorder but if you're a man who believes your woman and you don't need a pianist then it's not a mental disorder society's fault\nYou explain that one to me\nAnd none of it has anything to do with science and all of it is specifically designed to blame society for what is\nClearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm curious about calling in a mental disorder and the reason I Do so in because you can't actually treat mental disorder by blaming it on society if you want to come up with new treatments for mental disorder way to do that is not by saying that society at large is responsible for the discomfort of people suffering from the mental disorder I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Cortaro", "day": "23"}
