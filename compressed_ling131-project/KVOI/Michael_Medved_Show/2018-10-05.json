the news well of course you have because we talked about it but the um the unemployment rate the applications for new unemployment benefits\nWere like the best in fifty years so how do you keep it going and nobody better to talk to about that than Alfredo Ortiz was the president and CEO of the job creators network they're all about\nCreating jobs and continuing this spectacular spurt of job creation that we've just had\nAlfredo what's the most important element to keep this prosperity going\nOr Michael thank you for having me on your show the most important thing to keep it going to make sure that we have the right people in Congress\nAnd they said that know what it takes to get the economy growing right uh obviously the president as a job creator so you first and what it takes to make job great job keeping going which were the pro growth economy\nHad lower regulation less red tape let government and lower taxes and do three things that are all business owners wrapped in for and they got in the navy\nAnd small business optimism sky humor up in the sky high and you're seeing the results right three point seven percent unemployment rate record low numbers in terms of unemployment strict panic\nRecord low numbers in terms of unemployment also creates panic black you know for example ... percent I heard it below ... percent now I mean it's incredible but we need folks who understand what it takes to make an economy grow and those are the people currently in place right now\nOkay so what happens if I'm the ... the a disaster happens for conservatives and the Democrats take over the house of representatives and they immediately focused on trying to wipe out the tax cuts what happens to the prosperity\nIt's going to go away I mean there's there's no other question I mean they have point blank profit\nOr you know we've heard Nancy Pelosi say this week or was it worth it with her brain that are saying this because Chuck Schumer stated right that come

they not only one to raise taxes or they want to kill Medicare and effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty\nA ... instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean Michael this this is this is one of the the biggest things that we have to talk about uh nobody is actually talking about the thank you for bringing up this Medicare for all the expect the cost for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat was really an ... billion trillion yet so thirty seven thousand billion dollars\nI mean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years writes it so there's no end of that sustainable with going to end up happening is Medicare for all the medicine for nothing\nRight as far as I'm concerned is gonna be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up that's going to vote on it because it did not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are so close\nI I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great

shouldn't be on the Supreme Court first 'cause he was actually an 'cause he was in alleged rapist and because there's an alleged gang rape is emitted from either to do back in college then because he got angry when you've alleged that he committed rape oh that that is their latest stick one\nOf the people pushing that choice John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he said that at the time I bought cabinet had the qualifications for the Supreme Court TV selected I changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability I feel his performance in the hearing\nUltimately changed my mind he said that there's ... to the criticism that he has political bias and I think there's a lot this morning to the left and right to have an outcry recovered that emotional and Brett Kavanaugh was part of it I saw that today it doesn't matter even than it was emotional and that are that he was part of it because he said the Democrats wrapped together\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that isn't what's it like for that Democrats were out to get him remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it and it became he was a gang rape is let's say that you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service\nAnd that somebody you never knew him for with an allegation against you accusing him of gang rape and the people who oppose you politically the same people who said that they oppose you because you're a texture what then came forward and said we think that you are also a gang rape is might say wait a second this feels like a partisan hit job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing all the folks who say your digital temperament first of all these folks have never met a judge\nAnd there are lots of judges who are angry there are lots of judges who have personality issues like this idea that all judges are sort of ... on the hill bench justice company appalled three it's just not true it's just natural but the question of judicial temperament is how do you approach cases when you're on the bench and we have twelve years\nA well working like a Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench while he was twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench\nNo indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament was a moderate moderate conservative on the bench\nAnd then you went through a full Senate hearing you remember that there was a whole set of sending Harris before this whole garbage news cycle but yet there's a whole set of Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you had the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and Cory Booker\nAnd they went through the entire here and he was plastic right would do that was the the rip on him he was to do it was too robotic and then he was\nTwelve years on the bench lasted a full hearing ... ...\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gang rape and he got a little mad and it'll do oh my God how you look at that that's that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people react differently to different stimuli and you give me a massage that a different thing when you walk in the back of the head with a two by four I react slightly differently\nIf you massage man your must do and I can send your touch and I'm probably going to be placid unhappy if however you clocked me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be you know miffed enough to turn around and ... o'clock it back in the face\nThat's what happened right cabin up but apparently that's no good showing who have not really it he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal\nTrying to defend his behavior and apologizing for being too emotional as I said at the time he goes no apology to anyone on any of this none if I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people would accuse me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I Want this read into the congressional record I'm willing to state\nAnd wanting to spell this correctly\n... all democratic centered accusing me of sexual\nAssault on women I've never met go F yourself and let me explain why me by yourself I mean I won't go perform an anatomically impossible function upon yourself in the back row\nThe reason that the stakes are so high is because the court became something it never was before during the war in Iraq and afterward and that was an actual political institutions dedicated to a specific set of policy goals\nThe reason people care about the Supreme Court the reason that people think that the Supreme Court matter is because of things like Rosie way when the court decided that it was going to make national policy on the basis of left wing viewpoint having nothing to do with the constitution\nAnd the ... believe that the court was going to the final bastion of weapons and no matter what happened they could always count on the court to step in and defend left U.S policy priorities\nFor a long time that was basically correct and now it turns out that when Republicans want to restore the judiciary for its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written as it was men than the left has well hold on a second hold up a second that's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog ...\nNone of us would have happened if we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody really cared about that\nThey care about the Supreme Court because they think the Supreme Court is important the only keep the only reason people think the Supreme Court is important is because ... has turned it into a political tool and his use it as a club to me senseless people who actually believe in the text of the constitution\nFor the last sixty odd years if the audience and starts at fifty out here\nSince the Nineteen sixties since maybe Griswold versus Connecticut although you can certainly sigh case like what are the silver and the court has outstripped its boundaries many times before that he read Scott ...\nYeah I I wrote my entire Harvard law school third year paper on the idea that judicial review should we should never get her tail because down has never intended for the Supreme Court in the superior political branch and yet that's exactly what's happening\nIn any case the passions were running high yesterday and today Marco Rubio was talking about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the halls of the Senate on the Senate Hart building and he was drowned out immediately by protesters because this is the way our politics goes now\nEverybody [laughter]\n\nWe have one of your mind going on where you know are these are all different\nOkay and that's just that and that was a normal day for the center had to be escorted in my ... I Will not something remember that time\nPeople say that the right wing was really crazy and really radical remember the Tea Party and twenty ten how dangerous the right wing watch you know they never acquired police presence to escort members of Congress to and from things and natural quiet\nLet's be Frank about this I don't recall a Republican staffer ... ... members of Congress and released their children's health records which is a thing that actually happened in in her representative Sheila Jackson Lee tried to reveal senators children's health information\nTried to reveal senators children's health information that's what he allegedly threatened and that would be Jackson Cosco twenty seven\nWorks for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd protesters didn't stop of course Marco Rubio there was a protester operating Joe Manchin of West Virginia they're going to try to do the same thing I did a Senator Flake button whole somebody in an elevator and then yell at them about how they obviously have women because they believe in due process events yeah which was kinda ripped up and down by the right the other day for a speech he gave on the floor of a sudden it and that's because people were taking one line\nKind of out of context when he said he would have preferred Amy Coney Barrett\nSo what I my original hecklers Amy Coney Barrett if you recall\nBut the bottom line is the ... voting for cabinet what the point that he made is this false this dichotomy that's being drawn by\nThe left particularly between this case and then each a movement in which they say that if you support right cabinet and therefore I hate me too if you support Brett Kavanaugh's due process and presumption of innocence therefore you don't take women seriously he said that's garbage and the nonsense and he's exactly right of course that's exactly right\nSo we have left his and playing this\nAnyway and just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping enough probably not maybe the reason you're not sleeping enough is because your mattress isn't that great I Know you've got that expensive mattress out there at the mall but\nIt probably isn't as good as the metrics that you can get from he looks like why because he would sleep personalized as your mattress it'll just flipped it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to natural body type and sleep preference as to the perfect matter\nWhether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper whether you like a pleasure from but was he like no more get to know more confusion just got a huge leap dot com slash Shapiro take that too many sleepless imagine to a mattress and then they send it to you and you'll and rapid inflation in front of you you toss it on that front you're going to go\nMy wife and I have a he looks like ... I bought one from my sister for her wedding is that good for couples you can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and your preferences for each side and a ten year warranty get to try it out for a hundred ... you're not losing anything right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders again\nA hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro that she would sleep dot com slash Shapiro raw hundred and twenty five bucks soccer metrics or he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro All right so\nThese protesters are not stopping their rating people like Joe mansion trying to button whole people and we'll see if the protesters have they retired impact tomorrow because this is a razor thin margin remember\nIt was a if you wanted to forty nine vote that if you want to include Democrat Joe Manchin\nRepublican heavy to vote Cushing here if you're a mansion worse which is about if Susan Collins when he joined Lisa Murkowski there is no justice Brett Kavanaugh he goes down to failure\nIt's a disaster for Republicans in the terms because a lot of voters just say to their own party you know what you got an awful go screw off just late we're not interested in you anymore but this is the protesters sort of story\nIs worth noting there there's a lot of hung up today because President Trump tweeted out some of these protesters are being paid that is undoubtedly there are a lot of these protesters who are members of groups that\nActually will pay you to be out there for the day I'm sure many of them are spontaneous it's not all of them I just read one of the winning button hold Jeff Flake an elevator is an actual democratic\nOpera it I mean there's a person who works for a five oh one C. three Center for American democracy I Believe and that center is funded by George ... people are saying oh about ... what what part used George Soros and like the stand in for all human evil\nThat George Soros is the guy who I really just really than a lot of ways I don't think he's a good guy per se I think that for a lot of bad things but\nYou don't have to use George Soros has the bogeyman not ...\nBut there are a lot of leftist protestors out there who had their lunch paid for them by groups that are trying to astro turf then get out I think is eminently grow there was a protester I don't know about this protester named as protesters genuine rating Joe mansion\n\nHow are you hearing\nYour job to tell her how he's going to vote\nAnd of course when he should say is I'm happy to listen to your storage survivor also your corroborating evidence\nThey it's amazing I there was an article in your car today or yesterday saying that rate does not require cooperation because
