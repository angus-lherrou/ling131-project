one and simply be left alone\nIf you have a full third who are willing to fight and another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you can have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand people Americans who died in that war\nBut uh we don't have that the percentage of people on the left who uh want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI I think it's it's not anywhere near a third frankly I don't think it's near ten percent it's extreme crazies and they certainly don't deserve to be voted into\nOffice let's go to Tom in

I'm Jim thirty gravy or why don't more\n\nWelcome back as the bench bureau show tactic number one for the Democrats in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh data entry to the Supreme Court\nIs well let's just try to change the system itself well you'd actually have taken for government to do any of those things and also just to kind of work but that that was under attack and number two which is that women are suddenly under attack everywhere from everywhere\nOne of the great life it's being perpetrated it's being perpetrated by folks like Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett you'll remember was the top advisor to President Obama and she treated it that I think it sums up well the argument being made by belts and a lot closer\nTo all the survivors of sexual assault and women wonder if they will be believed that they are attacked no there's a growing powerful enough support there will always have your back we believe you we will stand with you we will defend you\nChange is coming\nTo the idea here is that if you supported Brett Kavanaugh your annoying women who make allegations of sexual assault\nThis show transparent and it's really quite dishes and disgusting I again\nOpposed Roy Moore for the Senate in Alabama as a Republican because there is there a viable evidence that he had done bad things with young girls when he was a younger man\nI did not vote for President Trump\nLarge measure because of his treatment of women\nThere are lots of people are not happy with sexual assault allegation\nSusan Collins the senator from Maine who came out in favor of Brett Kavanaugh is basically the deciding vote she's been ripped apart from what she had to say on CNN but there's nothing inherently wrong with what you said on CNN here's her explaining that while she believes something happened to Christine Blasey Ford she just doesn't leave that according to proponents of the evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was it was the guy who did it\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her family so I Do believe that she was assaulted I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the is it\nOkay and that prompted Mazie Hirono to come out and say how could Susan Collins doubt how confusing towns that was really funny because I don't remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forward by Michael ... and she claimed to Brett Kavanaugh had gang raped her\nOr the he was involved in gang rape you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women don't they believe that all women ought to be believed regardless of whether there's any sort of their Bible are corroborating evidence\nA Jewish went and sort of just a triple she was gone\nBut not it's not believe all women it's believed the women who he wants to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree that former slightly more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she's totally credible either at least her stories and corroborated and then people are like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving on when it\nBut you don't believe about one and you don't really want you to Broderick Kathleen will you don't believe Paula Jones you don't believe the waitresses where sandwich by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back and then I said\nIt's just it's maddening but here is made you want to think how could Susan Collins even haven't dealt how could you even ... because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ash keep up history simply without any Robert evidence whatsoever\nWhat to say that she thinks that Dr for think that she was assaulted what does that and see that there was collaboration because she had talked about this is talk to her husband to others before back half an hour every nominated to the Supreme Court took a lie detector test cover a similar fair\nOaks cups Mazie Hirono just again this is built on the line is that we may have lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war it's going to be that men verses women and women always must be believed and that men who do not buy in or women don't buy and are just ... of the system\nDoes it does the argument being made so I wasn't on it was on meet the press so it was on I shut up I meet the press after showing up at the hearing because of Dianne Feinstein who's a very serious senator we know and she explained were winning the cultural battle\nThis notion that if you tell your daughter not to ... because you should respect herself more than that at this makes you a bad parents or restricted parents is utterly insane it's utterly insane\nOnly somebody who has never really raise children in any serious capacity could think fish or maybe if you think there's a ... like maybe a different strategy may may I don't know about about electric what else the trends maybe she has maybe she ask it may may\nI Will say that it is a bad strategy to send your teenage girls taught high school and her ... ... just going to just going to say it's a bad idea\nAnd it doesn't make your bad parents Asia means you're trying to protect your daughter from the fact that there are dangerous people in the world and also because maybe your daughter doesn't want to look like a sex object all the time\nAnd should want to portray herself to sex object I like how the feminist movement move from the correct opinion about pornography that pornography was a justification of women for the pleasure of men to pornography is empowerment of women\nYeah I'm sure that all those men who are in their basements right now watching Stormy Daniels all tapes are thinking about the empowerment of women they're all feminists that's what they're thinking right now\nBut I Love women who show up at the Capitol where women for cabinet T shirts probably tell their daughters but I'm less revealing clothes or do that as I say I also like the equation put unless revealing clothes at the same thing as we want to make when none now okay when did modesty become such a terrible thing I mentioned be modest too by the way I just but\nNot pretend that men don't view women a centralized objects especially when women wear wear clothing that makes them\nMore likely to be viewed as such it's a free country can wear what you want and not paying you shouldn't wear what you want I'm saying I wouldn't I Would tell my daughter is that because I'm not an idiot okay here's a did this piece continues they're more sympathetic to Senator Orrin hatch of Utah we actually shoot away a crowd of women and told them to grow up well\nRight because they were screaming at him like ... we played the tape on the show and then he told them to grow up and then they told him to grow up which was hilarious and he's one million years old or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who's responsible woman telling him she was raped was I'm Sorry call the cops\nWhich is again not an improper response\nLike I'm Sorry that happened to you maybe you should talk to the authorities so we can catch the rapist and put him in jail is not a horrible response\nI liked it better when did it become a a bad response I I'm just wondering what do you think Lindsey Graham is going to do he'll grab a pencil like if somebody Sam you're going to lead them to a house is going to burst through the front door Lindsey Graham who's gonna burst through the front door like well\nYou have to shoot this fellow now because this woman without any evidence said that she was raped by you like that that's going to happen\nWhat do you think Lindsey Graham is going to say you'd want him to say you're a woman comes up because I was ... you think ... what are you supposed to say at that point you know what now that you told me you are right Brett Kavanaugh's rapist what in the okay this continues and we'll get deeper into the the insane amazed like mind\nInsane maze like mind\nOf the of the left on these on these women's issues in just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHelix sleep builds asleep was they take two minutes to complete they use the answers to match or body type and sleep preferences and the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from bed with us there is no more guessing and no more confusion ... he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes sleep was they will match you'd want mattress that will give you the best sleep of your life\nFor couples he looks can even split the mattress down middle providing individual support needs and feel preferences\nFor each side they have a ten year warranty gets tried out for a hundred nights risk free so what are you waiting for their mattresses are so good that\nMy wife and I got one and then we loved it so much we got one from my sister for a wedding right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all ...\nAnd up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off at us sleep dot com slash Shapiro that he likes sleep dot com slash a bureau or a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or helix sleep dot com slash Shapiro you've mattresses our top notch these are luxury quality mattresses it non luxury prices and you get a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or when you go to Hugh asleep dot com slash a bureau\nSo the rampant mind law that has taken over\nLarge swaths of the left obviously is is being recorded by their belief that if they just screaming loud enough that how men are such as this will win out Alexis Cornell has this piece in the New York times we're going through and I think it's indicative of a mindset on the life that it's pretty insane so here's the she's already accused women who\nSupported Brett cabinet or any Republican of being traders said these are the kind of women we think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped\nThe kind of women who agree with President Trump that it's a very scary time for young men in America what she said during a news conference on Tuesday\nWell it turns out you don't actually compare that to being falsely accused of rape is pretty bad being falsely accused of rape does indeed ruin your life destroy reputation destroy your family\nI don't know if you compare that to rape because there's no comparison like why don't I don't see the necessity of of comparing the crimes but being falsely accused of rape is a kind of a bad thing when President Trump says it's a very scary time for young men in America that is a hundred percent true\nI don't know a single mom not a single mom was a boy was not worried about the possibility of where all of this is going\nEspecially considering the vagaries of the nature of consent in\nOur current political discourse are now living in a time when title nine charges can be brought against basically any man on any campus for any reason without any evidence and destroy the guy's life\nBut here's here's what is going to continue and the people who scare me the most of his mother's sister's in wives of these young men because my stupid uterus still holds out some insane hope of solidarity first of all I just would like to point out that this appeared in the New York times the most solid paper in the United states according to ...\nAnd it printed a sentence in which a woman said that her uterus hold out hope\nYou would ride you not hold out hope ... are in Oregon and you say my appendix hold out hope\n... she says we're talking about white women the same fifty three percent to put their racial privilege ahead of their second class and gender status in twenty sixteen my voting to uphold the system and values only the rightness just as they have for decades\nSo white women put their femininity behind them they're not real women is what is going white women aren't real women they're just white people they're just faceless nameless white people you know like these gender list which it's a white ... since Nineteen fifty two white women have broken for democratic presidential candidates only twice\nIn the Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Ninety six elections according to an analysis by Jane John a political scientist that view at University of Southern California women of color and specifically black women make the margin of difference for Democrats\nThe voting patterns of white women and white men mirror each other much more closely and they tend to cast their ballots for Republicans the gender gap in politics is really a color line\nWell actually that's not really true the gender gap in politics is really a marriage line if you actually look at how single people vote versus how married people vote that's really the distinction\nMarry people tend to vote heavily Republican married women tend to vote heavily Republican single women tend to vote heavily democratic it's not about color and it's about sex it's very much about marital status\nWhy because when you have kids and you start thinking to the next generation when you start thinking what's the kind of society where I Want to bring up a family and when you start thinking you know I have a family unit that requires protection from an overarching\nFederal government that wants to get in my grill will that change his mind a little bit\nBut according to let this go now it's all about the white ... that's because white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual game\nIn return their place on a pedestal to be cherished and revered as Speaker Paul Ryan has had about women but all the while deny basic rights this is Jeff nonsensical it's just nonsense of I Know that person means white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual game\nFirst of all replace white with black in that sentence and obviously it's racist but beyond that the idea that women\nAre somehow trading on their sexuality in order to achieve some some decent treatment\nAt the hands of the patriarchy this is all this is all crazy I'm Sorry this is all crazy stuff and if I urge Democrats to to run down this hill screaming is like an she's as fast as possible and please go do this make this year electoral strategy\nAlthough suburban white women who you're trying to gain in the next election I urge you to scream at them and tell them they're terrible people because they're white
