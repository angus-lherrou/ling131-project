some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news and that's not to say that I'm not big news about um undignified about this it's just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad\nAnd his wife Ashley\nThat's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and I'm just\nSaying all the judges justices of the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than Trump ruined dead as he does because what he said was outrageous and he was so off the rails any ruin that never before any spoiled that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAnd you know what when you watch it that is simply not true and\nLet me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw\nOn NBC and very much on CNN which just deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterwards and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people

that show talking about the swearing in ceremony it was a formal swearing and he had actually been sworn in\nUnofficially privately by Justice Kennedy on Saturday Night right after he was confirmed and didn't want to waste any time on that and uh but last night was an important occasion and by the way I salute Justice Ginsburg I salute Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor injustice briar\nThe Democratic appointees on the court lets usually called the more liberal block on the court they came to this or that they came to the East Room and the White House\nAnd they did some salad our solidarity with their new colleague which goes to some of the traditions of the Supreme Court that are worth remembering\nAntonin Scalia may rest in peace and ... memory continue to be a blessing\nJustice Scalia was very good friends with Justice Ginsburg and I spoke to Justice Scalia of that I said come on everybody says that you guys are really good friends\nAnd care for that even be true because she's the most liberal members of the court the most active is mostly on the left and and you of course a leading light of constitutional ism and originalism justice is absolutely true she's great person\nThey both live opera it's shot\nOr I mean ... I don't know about Justice Ginsburg but Justice Scalia really new opera and I knew about net opinions of that as people who do love opera do well and what a wonderful family he had and apparently they together in each other's homes all the time they were friends\nAnd that's a beautiful thing and who knows look\nIt's it's very very possible that judge Kavanaugh is going to be on the court for Thirty years it's a thirty two years until he is the age that Justice Ginsburg is now\nSo it's it's great that these people are there to show them some support here's what judge Kavanaugh said in his brief remarks after after taking the oath and after introducing his wife he said this\nThe Senate confirmation process was contentious an emotional that processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be\nI take this office with gratitude and no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability and unity my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans\nAnd for all of America I Will work very hard to achieve that goal\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every but again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and open minds\nEvery American can be assured that I Will be an independent an impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law\nAnd then just as Canada brought it home this way\nAlthough the ... Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me\nMy approach to judging remains the same a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret\nThe law not make the law\nA judge must interpret statutes has written and the judge must interpret the constitution has written informed by history and tradition and precedents\nOkay that's a judge now justice Brett Kavanaugh and may he enjoy a long and distinguished career\nThe um [noise] ... okay you\nJust heard this now for a little bit of perspective this is what CNN had to say about it I mean you've heard it even experience yourself I have a whole text in front of me here's what Don Lemon on CNN had to say about this event\nSo this is a time when you might expect a president a president to call for us to be put aside to put aside our differences to call for unity or you might expect\n... they're called for unity or you might expect any other presidents and do that but not this one President Trump is actions in his words so you everything you need to know the president is using division as a weapon and he probably is proud of every when he and his party yet\nNo matter how much it costs Americans are proof remember his divisive language tonight at justice Kavanaugh swearing in\nProve that this president\nIs our divider and she\nReally is that is that fair do you think\nWhen President Trump including his remarks said um\nIs that the U.S to read that gay ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders

that the process\nThat victimized both Dr ... for an end\nJustice Kavanaugh that's a process was unusual and not admirable\nLou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael ...\nYour\nEye Iran\nRight yeah um I mean I I don't know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um proven to be innocent um he didn't he didn't investigate\nAll the people who work in that we're likely have more information it was not a thorough process so for me to go around and do that slap it in our face\nOkay to lawyers they voted for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it up because that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate\nDr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez concern I mean\nCome on come on\nIt's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think we're right not to do it was go through a whole investigation of a Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant the question was if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could go to from the fact which\nI I just I just don't want that took place I Believe a man like that operate court I don't understand how you can't

nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign has been really a long time very intense [noise]\nThis morning in a actually it was a very reassuring\nA press availability and anyone who believes that there was some kind of secrets that Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley or whether she's planning to run against him she's not a as a matter of fact she made that extremely clear\nUp is she a presidential possibility for the future of of course he is\nIs she just about the strongest Republican nominee one good thing go for ... for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nYeah I think she is she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity in class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho wasn't an ideal partner for her as secretary of state the um\nUh she did a comment about this rumor that she's going to be challenging Trump for the nomination and two thousand twenty of course that's ridiculous she won't and here is Nikki Haley making at about as close as clear as she possibly could\n\nBe selfless enough to know when you step aside and\nElse to do the job so that's you know\nSay that on our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me what are we doing it for the first one so I'll look forward to supporting the front\nThat\nA President Trump said that's so good and uh of course it is and it's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some\nDisagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did a but she managed to work with the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do or job\nAnd it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization\nBut she stood up for the country and did it with class and eloquence here's President Trump this morning and and again this was a press availability where they both look comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs\nYou only like each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in the\nOval Office and er here is what President Trump said about the first inkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably ... years ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but the other day I Want to take a little time off or\nBeen a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise] for years and she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world is very dangerous lots of things [noise]\nBut she's a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of solving problems so together just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless are you going to say this but I\nOkay and uh then Nikki Haley talked about some of her sense of accomplishment she's completing her first\nTwo years ah her two years as UN ambassador and she's going to get any working there until January it's unclear which is going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is a Nikki Haley talking about\nThe achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years\nWon't get what has happened is here with the United states on foreign policy now\nThey know that if we say we're going to do something we fall for when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO\nSaying that other countries have to pay their share\nI mean whether it's the trade deals were given a major thing they did the ... and they follow through\nThese ten years of the last\nThree billion and the un like\nSudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean\nWhich we're the largest and generations down in a way that we can really work for\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need center fan you can't overlook the fall of the bad things they're doing do you have to see them for the ... that they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strength and courage that the president showed in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we\n[noise] you know all of those things have made a huge difference in the U.S and I can tell you that um [noise]\nSong again any us a strong in a way that should make math and fearing proud\nAnd this is I'm about as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth\nAnd yes she was part of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about having on and the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world as she speaks very well she has dynamics you certainly would have the president's confidence\nI should also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or clip talk or see where\nThis family that seems to be attacked for its financial manipulation of every other day by some kind of two thousand page New York times article very encyclopedic and well raised in\nOr Hillary Clinton actually had a reputation as being somebody you could actually talk to him and work with on some things\nAnd for her analysis in jest that civility is impossible without Democrats in control is outrageous especially when you look at Democrats freaking out like that the teacher who was in trouble for suggesting murder\nMurder of home no it's not Donald Trump this time we'll get to that coming right out on the ... that show meanwhile a quick word from relief factor this came in from Janice\nHow

down\nAll I can say is I'm stuck in a glass cage you've a motion a glass cage with emotion I'm so sad right now\nI'm the sadness overwhelms me at times if I have to take a break to go cry in the corner is rock myself in the ice cream that might be happening a little bit later in the show we'll try to avoid it as best we can Nikki Haley made that announcement in the White House with President Trump today was a shock announcement here's what she had to say\nOn it has been an honor and all I can I you know I said I in\nLeave the state that race and serve\nReally been a blessing and I want to thank you for that\nNow Nikki Haley was indeed a bad asking her job as the UN ambassador she basically spent every day going and yelling at the Aspen which was injured great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about\nHow the United states was exceptional and America was unique place in our allies like Israel where we're supporting and how the UN was basically the most isolated of the international\n\nSort of lay out and she was exactly correct about all those things I Will miss Nikki Haley greatly explains some of the things that she got done as UN ambassador\nTo kind of look at look at what happened is here with the United states on foreign policy [noise] now the United states\nWhat they what\nThey know if we say we're going to do something we follow through and the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons\nIn Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether the ... the main thing they get tired [laughter]\nOkay so they're button bunch of rumors about what's going to happen next people suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become\nThe the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm just going to say that right there right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go to the UN ambassador it would be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate\nOr she could just do battle with Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham to point out that's all that he would do all day long it would be Lindsey Graham to point out and just yell at people would you be\nAmazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there some rumors and maybe it'll be Dina Powell who was a former member of the administration or or maybe it'll be ... we're now who would be terrific he's our current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they're going to call him back from Germany to make a new a new master\nThere are few other possibilities Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration now she's out she is not going back to the Senate\nMy guess is that she is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now but I get the sense from her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that you sort of been burned out on this job and I hear I mean that's that's a pretty brutal job I met with ambassador Haley just a few months back\nAnd all of it is to say that these estimates are are wildly overstated in terms of the amount of damage that they are likely to do the reason that I say that it becomes a report itself\nThe way that these these things get report in the media is that there is virtual certainty and the scientific community at this stuff is going to happen the problem is that virtual scientific consensus doesn't actually exist a lot of key issues coming up there's another point that folks aren't really making about the type easy

thanks to global warming millions will be flooded out of their homes people starving in the streets catastrophe Mad Max type stuff\nYeah it's not really true in the eye PCC report even it's most brutal statements and how bad things are going to be they seem kind of unsure about whether that stuff to actually going to happen and\nHere's here's what you know that it's easy to be I'd be she she makes two types of production in this report the first type of production that two degrees of global warming will be worse than one point five degrees and global warming tells you\nOK and they get out with high confidence that and they get to the actual specific production and would do is virtually every specific production they make about the amount of damage that's going to be done to the world climate based on one point five degrees Celsius of change\nVirtually all of their production our couch in terms of medium confidence medium confidence means a fifty fifty shot so basically flip a coin is whether they are right or wrong on that and then you're going to determine whether we ought to just write capitalism\nOn the basis of that so for example in the in the first chapter well in the summary rather than the summary of\nFinding for the IT teacher report it says on the one hundred and five thousand species study\nSix percent of insect eight percent a plant four percent the vertebrates are projected to lose over half their climatic leap determine geographic range for global warming up one point five degrees Celsius compared with the Eighteen percent of insect sixteen percent the plant and eight percent the vertebrates for global warming up two degrees Celsius\nSo basically everything is going to double everything's going to double\nOr in for insect is going to triple written guys and the double and then for insects triple what your degree Celsius to change versus one point five degrees Celsius of change but that is expressive medium constant confident\nAre you willing to bet the future of the world economy\nAnd leave billions of people in poverty because now you're taking a virtual certainty that hundreds of millions of people live in poverty and increased conditions poverty and you're betting that against the fifty fifty possibility that some bugs will have less space to lead now that's a serious consideration but I think that there's also the possibility that\nNumber one is a wrong number two there's a possibility that technology tends to\nActually manifest itself in different ways but when you see serious economic serious environmental problems technology is a good way of mitigating against that in fact there's your kitchen maid the global warming because the greenhouse effect has acted like a greenhouse you seen as an increased screening and certain parts of the globe specifically because of global warming\nAnd that's sort of repeated thing inside PCs you report the more specific they get the lower their confidence level so for example they say\nAbout approximately four percent of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one side to another at one degree Celsius global warming\nCompared to Thirteen percent at you for a two degrees Celsius of global warming so if you'd reach out just global warming Thirteen percent of the entire global terrestrial land area is going to be transformed in terms of ecosystem but again they say that with medium confidence\nSo that they were full confidence is it two degrees where some of them went five degrees but they say with medium conference conference meeting half half\nIs that this change will be really really dramatic\nAnd that that's basically the case that they're making now when I say all this folks and let me say well you're a climate change deniers again I'm not denying climate changes taking place I'm asking what the actual impact of climate change will be and to what measures will be necessary in order to curb said climate change\nSo I Want to take another story that's in the news today because it's sort of astonishing it sort of astonishing\n... yesterday it guy won the Nobel Prize in economics and then as William ... works over a gal and left champion this guy William ... why does north house has four years in modeling what sort of economic systems would be best in terms of carbon global warming\nAnd this has been his actual like for what that oh look at that that's a slap against Trump slap against the right finally\nAnd good luck with all of that good luck with all that\nAll of this seems frankly like an attempt to avoid\nThe to avoid the reality which is that we have to make economic decisions based on possibilities and probability that you don't get to destroy capitalism wholesale just because you don't like capitalism and when you hear people saying wild things about how the cities are going to be underwater and millions of people are going to die and all the rest\nJust remember that there is an agenda backing some of these folks and that the alarmist protections folks like Al Gore have not in fact I'm trip and we shouldn't take global warming seriously we should but that's why we should use money for abatement that's why we should be looking at building ... that's why we should be looking at creating\nBarriers to two nominees and figuring out exactly how to move people inland\nIt means that there are lots of ways over the course of the coming century for us to deal with some of the increased problems of climate\nBut exaggerating the problems of climate ain't going to do it and then suggesting that we overthrow capitalism to do it is not exactly a smart solution nonetheless radicalism rules the day\nAnd it it's driven by a sort of we're ... I did this this idea that\nWe're emitted hiding the ash eschatology we we are we are about to experience the end of time and this exist in a lot of religious communities nearly Christian Community thought that sort of the the kingdom of God was at hand it's happened in the Jewish community do you see it among certain Muslim sects\nWell you see it in ... in the secular world to the idea that we're living in the end times and the apocalypse has basically upon us and that means that\nHarsh action is necessary we need harsh action now we need crazed action now because we don't everyone is going to die millions will die millions will die and we keep hearing about the increase of hurricanes and tornadoes even though there's been no actual increasing the number of hurricanes or tornados\nWe keep hearing about these opposing outsized impact of hurricanes and tornadoes even though for example in Bangladesh which just experienced is pretty significant hurricane or a couple of
