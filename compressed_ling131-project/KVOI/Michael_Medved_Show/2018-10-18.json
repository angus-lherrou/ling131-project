says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jews often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan hacks it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase in free slightly but ah my source for this is a not only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the treasury reported that federal revenues rose by is zero point four percent from the two thousand and Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year\nAnd uh they view that a treasuries assigned the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes issue with that because\nThey say well the growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right that the growth in revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem we have is we're spending too much and I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and the knowledge that we should do more let's go\nTo on disagreeing today Christine in Seattle you're on the Michael method show\nFrom Michael I'm I Am calling today because I just like with your guest marijuana\nI Am a survivor

drug\nWas scared to do that and I didn't want to\nBecome reliance on it so with a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am\nRecovering I'm I'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been legal for a long time um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am a gun that is a concern of mine um however I\nProven to myself I'm a numerous times that like I'll go I'd gone through fans in the

therapy session I agree\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you and then the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times they have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd I was saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and I say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said at the the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the ideas looked life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly was opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more

place where these allegations were always treated in a circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years\nWe get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff that ends up being real solve it ends up being great from it ends up being clearly made up political yet\nAnd there's a way to deal with this with the FBI and in the Senate confidential process\nThat doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what I wanted to start at the time that back to the theme of our half an hour I gather here I really do think there is a desperation for\nSome of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more if what they want what\nThey don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve a long term problem they're trying to make politics and our other gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group we had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself realizing as many as ... to you today talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there is only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preventing constantly for the camera and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative or rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially caucus there aren't really parties and argue that camera all our one one house a state legislature\nAnd so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with long term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bell that's cost effective\nUh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have lightly different priorities of which ... which highway to find it so much healthier thing to the bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by project if if federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional system which can maintain a framework for ordered liberty affirming the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author sorts of right then government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nI we need governments that are sympathetic to the United states\nA general I'll see see is vastly preferable to the Muslim Brotherhood a government that that actually fell and made a mess of Egypt\nI I don't think that somehow there is a a danger here worse than Obama who dealt with other evil regimes like Iran or we will be right back on that Medvedev show a quick word from relief factor which is a natural way of dealing with the aches and pains of life\nIf you want to take care of yourself and you want to reduce the ... or some of the eggs and the arms legs feet neck back\nReally factor can help most people feel a real difference after taking

time and labor power those company United States and many other nations around the world are capitalist country a capitalism is not the only economic system available\nThroughout history other countries have embraced other systems like socialism or communism so it's important to explore what capitalism actually is\nHidden and recently reported that sixty six percent of people between the ages of Twenty one and thirty two have nothing to save for retirement\nHowever according to the salon the reason many millennials haven't been investing in mutual fund or building up their own financial mess deck isn't because they're too broke or do they lack personal responsibility is because they think are critical economic system capitalism will cease to exist by the time\nThey're in

that's basically the socialist model so where are they going to pay for all of us I Love how the Atlantic describes ... proposal\nOf course the federal proposals were commenting never getting caught in some cases on the scale of the Trump tax cuts or the Affordable CARE Act\nThose are not the same thing from tax cuts are not things that costs money their meat paying less money into the federal government that is not a federal cost a federal costs you spending my money not and you're telling me I get to keep my own money\nAnd it's not a cost let someone keep their own money\nThe way that this measure didn't say suggested me a portable CARE Act which is a government expenditure based on tax receipts it's the same thing as cutting tax receipts by saying that people can keep throwing money is a slight of hand a festival sleight of hand\nThe brown legislation with costs one point four trillion dollars over a decade Harris legislation would come in at something like two hundred billion dollars per year which means to ... dollars over the course of a decade\nHarris has proposed repealing that Trump tax cuts paper mill that is not even come close to covering the kind of cautious talking about and they're talking about universal health care and they're talking about free child welfare and they are talking about ... or ... for childcare and they're talking about free college tuition none of this stuff is going to get paid for\nSo why why it has is they're all of us who just for this sort of stuff in a time when we have as an yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars of capitalism because we have shifted our mindset in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today it shifted our mindset when it comes to\nWhat our wide should be like we believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here you hear this from Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world but we really have people who do not have enough money to buy all the things that they could possibly all\nYou hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here you deserve stuff you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuck in a baseline assumption you're entitled to things here is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure\nThat's what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your rights in pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream American Dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to\nAnd building lives for their family and creating prosperity from the ground up\nAmerican stories people crossing the Appalachian into wilderness they did not know places that had not been that going to areas where they had no allies setting down roots and trying to build towns in civilization\nWell that's not that's not correct and again this is not coming out of a place of a lack of sympathy this is coming from a place where I sympathize with people's plight and the question is what can you make your life better\nDemocrats don't tell them what they want to talk about what can we do to make your life better\nAnd the answer is very little the real question is what can you do to make your life better because every successful ... person on planet earth is the person who at some point said to themselves what can I Do to help myself America is a country of people saying to themselves what can I Do to help my lot in life\nWhat can I Do to be more ambitious what can I Do to stretch my wings and fly\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat's the American way and it's not the American way if it wasn't you know ... comfortable to stretch a wing it may be difficult to leave home it may be hard to do that\nBut it so so we're just going to make sure you know you never happen\nWe're going to cuddle you we're going to make sure that your swab in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone\nAnd that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation and something much more cynical purpose for innovation I'm an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at tells like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort\nOf of thinking is evident in major cities and\nCounties across the United states if you actually want to reinvigorate the American spirit we're going to have to teach people the same lesson the gods hot Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible I get up leave the home that you were born in and go to a place you do not know that's how we become bigger that's\nHow we become better that's how wives become better to have a world becomes better trade becomes better it's like you have cool stuff is white cultured become better because they experienced bounce off of other cultures\nThat this notion that we can hunker down now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do is hunker down and live and and redistribute what's in our backpacks\nThose back after going to run out ... there's not wait any of this war okay so in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating

research in the name of white supremacy\nSticking your neck out on political issues is difficult to Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee who sought to convene a panel on the racist misuse of genetic confound little fracking\nBut the specter of the fields ... past which include support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticist in light of today's white identity politics\nThey also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis of hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued that racist ideology is an argument that I have on a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs and over a box\nOr Jane is black and and I think rightly has great sensitivity and everybody should have great sensitivity but I think they would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to the races past of the United states and the and the racist association\nBetween politics and bad science\nAnd so this has led to some serious conversations between the two of us about political correctness about whether in fact there's an appropriate time to talk about\nIQ for example or standardized testing for example or about the natural differences between men and women\nLike one can't talk about biology without being condemned sexist or racist he's a real issues that we have to discuss and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash a lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context and then use that to call them into submission minority group and that's basically what this New York times articles about\nHas in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers and far right Internet forums others have fielded confused where he's about claims of white superiority wrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how genes factor into America stock racial disparities has surfaced and the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gaps\nImmigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like ... or ... friends and family pedigrees according to experts you track the far right\nToday's proponents and racial hierarchy are making their case by misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nAnd debate that have been largely limited ivory tower forums scientist whose job is to mine human the humanities genetic variation or the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond all of this\nPut out the science and then defend the science that's the way to respond all of us instead scientists afraid that there are scientists are going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or used for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they are going to simply squash\nAll of this discussion internally John of Emory University of Chicago evolutionary biologists studying human genetic diversity is easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated right\nNow that it's very much on my mind once my doctor November his folded into his recent talks to pitch a group of white nationalist chugging milk at a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose as adults\nAnd also showed that social media posts from an account and she called enter the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the traits evolutionary history\nIn most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lack of switches off after childhood with the arrival of the first cattle herders in Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that left that turned on provided enough of nutritional lived up to nearly all of those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post shows a snippet of hate speech urging individuals that African ancestry to leave America saying if you can't drink milk you have to go back well\nI mean so what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist instead of the stupidest people on the planet\nThey're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb houses it's one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority and you really shouldn't send your best is I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetics documentary warned that research is wrapped in numerous habits that are likely get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry test indicating exclusively European heritage but the problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is they confounding factor when you look at it from eating racism to America so take for example racial disparities in education\nSo there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels I was going to get them into college\nAnd the suggestion is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system\nIn alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nAnd that is true not just with regard to black and white it's not very productive white and Asian white people score lower on the SATs and Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that is genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that's a hotly fraud question in science\nBut suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores is a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome and we just to the wrong measures to to deal with those outcomes\nGenetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions you have to be very careful that because obviously don't want to give material to people who are suggesting that people some people are near inherently\nAre inherently worse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because you've already scientist\nSo it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have of organized meetings and social scientists and it's a social implication of the field newest tools David Nelson a Baylor College of medicine geneticist who's president of the human genetic society has it will not say completely quite on the issue is that there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology which", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show",
