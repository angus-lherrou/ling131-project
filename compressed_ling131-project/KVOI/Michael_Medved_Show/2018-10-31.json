Halloween the message of a trick or treating teaching a little kids to be panhandlers not not my favorite thing but my wife feels differently and she is on the line Dr Diane that the best selling author clinical psychologist or do you recognize that wonderful song they're dying\nNo that's a new one to me tonight is tonight\nTonight and I I was created for it's from the uh one of the immortal offerings on television which was the Garfield Halloween special\nOh yes of course how can I missed it\nRight how indeed um do you\nAnswer you have to answer you on that can't handling actually what do you teach kids difference between panhandling and asking\nFor something and receiving it or how letting the other person determine whether or not you received it in other words you don't go out to the door with the light is turned off you go to those doors that are welcoming you anything trick or treat which is a request and then the homeowner chooses to give you candy\nOkay well we would read that but it's it's you're saying trick or treat which is kind of like uh it\nIt is your candy or your toilet paper over your trees\nNo I don't think that happens too much anymore okay maybe I'm wrong but I I haven't seen that happen very much anymore because too much trouble for people to do with it rather be out partying\nDirection and also because everyone's so intimidated that they give the candy\nHow do you think Myers are coming when they turn out in the white carpet pumpkin\nAnd say what are you in here like here I mean that is a time or we connect with the parents in our neighborhood is a time where we're happy to see the kids and how much it growing in the last year and it's not a time in every neighborhood and across the United states that were teaching kids to panhandle\nThere are ... are some municipalities where it's against the law for people to\nGo trick or treating a past the age of uh a sixteen or Eighteen do you think that's appropriate\nI whenever municipalities that can do but I mean I don't think that you see many adults going trick or treating you think Ken going and I see you're going but that I don't think that you see adults going by themselves asking for candy\n[laughter] okay am I trying to reduce the amount of candy or semi\n... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number I bet you have a supporter here in mark in Seattle you're on the ... that show\nThis I'm I'm calling because your wages right Michael you're wrong\nShe's awesome I I hear this every year I Love Halloween if I wasn't six foot four three hundred pounds I Would go you get to see all your neighbors you know who's hoarders you know who's the strange one it's perfect for the community in just a reminder that this life has several\nUh-huh I'm the one of the things that I was and I you mentioned about you you would go yourself if you weren't a large and intimidating person I'm not that you're intimidating more but um yeah okay it says in the song a good things to eat\nA you've heard some of the dentist warnings about Halloween right I mean basically the very few people who give out slices of apple right\nWhen nobody won a trip Russia's we've got two questions from\nThe local dentist okay have you\nKnow right I I Know and I I think uh America really does I don't I don't know if there's any one's tried to put a special tax on Halloween candy I'm not suggesting it mark I appreciate your call and thank you for listening or to the show\nDying wife appreciate her and like today\nI I Do and she well I think it is you're going

you can meet your neighbors you can do it I I did the\nLast year I did it last year I went with them and I brought my big daddy\n[laughter] and I'm sure you got a good hall\nI appreciate it did you what was your costume mark\nUm\nMy big daddy [laughter] and I'm sure you got a good hall I appreciate it did you what was your costume mark\nUm last year what was it was a hippie\nUh-huh well that's the end there plenty of people who look like that in uh Seattle area they're called homeless people what uh let's see if homeless people come to your door trick or treating what's the appropriate response die\n[laughter] crack then I don't think I've ever seen that um I don't ... I mean I feel bad for them anybody who is dressed up like your begging for candy I I Do have compassion for\n'em and let's go to a a Tessa in snow Paul me Washington You're on the Michael ... that show hello Tessa\nHi Michael I think that's ridiculous to the here and say that the kids are learning to panhandle during Halloween I mean you can say that for every holiday that's out there are less you're asking them to sit on a strange man's lap Easter you're sitting here killing them pick it up off the ground\nFourth of July you're telling them it's OK thing on fire for well I think it definitely are down here and say that panhandling is what we're teaching kids at that time\nWell sent out except most people generally in the in the rest of the year you would occasionally sit on somebody's lap and uh you would occasionally like different things on fire I don't know any other occasion and die You're welcome to jump in here\nAny any other occasion where you come up to people you may or may not know\nAnd a holdout a bag and expect them to put some good\nBird though it's generosity between neighbors you're sitting here having an open and fun time and you know kids that are younger obviously do it under supervision and then when the older kids I'd rather have my teenagers go trick or treating than going out in the neighborhood and causing trouble\n...\nThings like that as well the thing that makes a difference is that it is one day set aside universally recognized as a time of being appropriate\nTo go in the neighborhood we all recognize gather it that we expect to have kids knocking on the door asking for candy it's not a big surprise where he got in front of the door and say give me your fatty it's something that we all your gear and we choose to participate in and those who don't just turn off the porch light\nLet's go to Tom Glenn door or California Hello Tom you're on the ... that show with the ...\nThank you very much Michael doctors I and you did a really good job in totally decimated Michael's\nThink Michelle absolutely right and I should mention is well that this is an opportunity for people to teach kids how to interact with their neighbors and other people from home they receive things and other people for from him they're asking things so I don't think that's a negative and I do the same thing I make sure the kids say thank you\nYeah in other words it from age according to his ability to each according to his need now where am I heard that before will [laughter] thank you day we will be right back on the great Halloween debate

V. or why do voice [noise]\n[noise]\nYour daily dose of debate I watch some but not I don't trust them a hundred percent Michael ... but he does an amazing job\nAh [laughter] thank you senator Donnelly a let us go back on the Michael ... show\nA where by the way you can still get my pillow and a buy one get one free on special when you mentioned the ... that go to my pillow dot com if you've been thinking about this great product this is a great time to get it\nAnd I go to my pillow dot com mentioned the promo code med bed when you order and you get\nAn extra one for far rate or if you call up it'll work that way it's toll free eight hundred three to six to eight eight hundred three to six to eight out okay we're talking about how stupid things said by\nA number of a recent Democrats or Nancy Pelosi we've covered Joe Donnelly we've covered and then there is a Andrew Gillum who's the mayor of Tallahassee the ethically challenged mirror Tallahassee no I don't think President Trump was right to call him a stone cold these\nBut a Andrew Gillum is a stone cold and wrong candidate for governor of Florida particularly because he just\nCommitted and she didn't ethic unfair attack\nOn his opponent runs his hand has a round the Sanders member of Congress a a navy veteran a graduate by the way of of Yale and then he went to an inferior law school over at Harvard I'm Rhonda Santa's was attacked\nFor quote justifying slavery here's what Andrew Gillum had to say\nUh we have that right there\nHis campaign has been inundated by racism when the people supporting him or his on the tolls or what he was saying\nDo you think that that was the defining characteristic of this race\nNo I don't I mean I think um I Do\nA missile defenses\nOf the given too much harbor a two races and you know ... ... um [noise] he spoke at conferences with him he authored a book justify slavery right\nOkay he did not author a book justifying slavery I had been unaware of Rhonda sense this book but it looks and sounds pretty good the um the book is called dreams from our founding fathers a first principles in the Obama era and it's obviously a play on dreams from my father\nAnd here's the section of the book that the Gillum campaign is pointing to and uh it is very clear very explicit in in the book that dissenters beliefs that slavery was a great evil\nBut what he talks about is how it is that downing fathers who are very anti slavery like Alexander Hamilton who was there at the constitutional convention like Benjamin Franklin who was one of the originals originator is the American anti slavery society how they could do along with a ...\nThat didn't mandate slavery but it allowed it and here is what a what the census said just so that you understand\nHe said this is why there was no real chance at the convention constitutional convention would abolish the peculiar institution of slavery some of the notorious compromises the demonstrated a toleration of slavery such as the federal ratio which allows a slave holding states to count five slaves as the equivalent of three free citizen\nThe free states did not want slaves counted at all because they did not want the political power of a slave states to be enhanced\nWere even wants to be necessary to ensure ratification Hamilton a counselor to the New York menu mission society menu mission means the freeing slaves\nLater lamented that without such a compromise no union could possibly have been formed similarly Benjamin Franklin who served as president of the ... Pennsylvania abolition society declined to read a letter to the convention delegates from the society that down slavery on religious and Republican grounds\nFranklin did not want to derail the convention by further inflaming the delegates over the issue of slavery and believe that the United states could not last without a new federal government forests he wrote in his final convention speech our states are on the point of separation only to meet here after for the purpose of cutting more than others throats\nFor anti slavery delegates like Hamilton and Franklin abolition of slavery would be a moot point if a failure to erect a functioning government enough down the ideals of the American revolution and their infancy than the future of all Americans the free as well as the slave would eventually be as serves\nTo a despotic government okay does that sound like he's defending slavery ... it it is completely\nBogus and utterly irresponsible and I imagine that a mirror Gillum never even picked up the book\nThat he's condemning which sounds like it's kind of worth picking up in the book justify slavery and um\n[noise]\nAnd then there's this I mean if if you talk about Democrats just going way over the top I Karen ... who is a columnist for the Washington Post was on MSNBC with Morning Joe and Mika Brzezinski listen\nAll western point and that's coursing right now we're our politics and it's something that is um\nI think what we need to understand it not just about rhetoric is not just about political points about flipping the people's lives on now on the line and going back to the Republican Party and going back to the Trump\nAnd it's just this week that three men in Kansas or convicted of trying to bomb Somali refugees and they said in court that ... anti Muslim rhetoric how to influence that decision to take people's lives is is not just a matter of of rhetoric of distractions of a cultural\nPoisonous is a matter of people\nDying over the climate that's being created by by not only the White House and condoned by by people like Steve ... Lindsey Graham but that\nPeople are dying literally dying over there and I think I think that in one thing that Americans need to consider when they go to the cause is this a country that want to be right now the last week that we've had the last two weeks\nIf I were any other country I mean it shall travel warnings to the United states over the climate and the violence that we see\nOK really if you look at the murder statistics we're still\nAt less than half the murder rate\nThat we had in the Nineteen eighties and this is something that all Americans should be proud of it's not just a Republican achievement but there's a new ad frankly that that was run by the Trump reelection campaign 'cause this is not the Republican campaign committee\nThis is the ... twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican ads I've ever seen and really mean it\nIt hits exactly where this problem came to order which is why is it that right now the places where\nRepublicans are facing a stiff his challenges or privilege suburbs places that have done very well that are\nEarning lots of money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new\nConstruction of those places that are doing so well why are people in those communities leaning against Trump and yet in down crowd and\nThey're not going to be able to do anything unless we get the Senate because as\nYou okay oh no you're right you know you're an and frankly\nEven if the Democrats took the Senate we still have President Trump as president for two more years in anything that they tried to do to expand or re expand government's role in health care would it be vetoed listen I appreciate your call and we can continue the conversation\nBut what you're talking about trying to focus on Trump's personality I Know Trump kind of wants to do that\nBut it's not good for the country and it's not the right issue in this election uh meanwhile a quick word from relief factor\nUm the lead factor actually provides\nA mechanism for you to reduce the ... the aches and pains that come along with regular life and they do and for most people they start using relief factor was a dietary supplement full of natural good stuff for your body\nThat to release factors starts working in five or six days you can still a real difference and for the great majority of people over Seventy percent nearly three quarters of people who get relief factor find after three weeks which cost just Ninety five cents a day\nAfter three weeks Nineteen Ninety five they a recent\nReally factor works so well that they get more of it you have nothing to lose but your pain\nAnd the whole world to gang go to relieve factor dot com that is relief factor dot com when we come back I Want to play this ad which I think is much more effective than other hands in this cycle for the Republican side will we're coming right back on the method show\nMichael ...

United states\nThere's a lot of talk this week about radicalization and polarization and the idea is that right wing radicalization is being led by the right wing rhetoric at Fox News and and the right wing rhetoric from President Trump expressing their viewpoint today is Paul Krugman who is legitimately\nOne of the worst columnist in America yes heavy competition over on the New York times editorial page with folks like Charles Blow but Krugman is truly inexorable columnist I usually reserve that word only for Michael most\nIt certainly applies to Paul Krugman as well proven has column

into a black church\nIf he'd gotten there now earlier we probably would have had another mass murder\nAll these hate crime in clearly linked the climate of paranoia and racism deliberately fostered by President Trump and his allies in Congress and the media telling black people is an old American tradition but is it experiencing revival in the Trump era\nAt sentence is purely despicable the idea that telling black people is an old American tradition but it is experiencing a Bible I assume when he means by that is that slavery and Jim Crow were old American tradition and that Trump is reviving knows which of course is a complete why\nHe ... he continued just when the bombs were discovered many on the right immediately claimed or fake news or a false flag operation by liberals but the FBI
